DOCTOR: Well, who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eatchips, go to bed, and watch telly, while all the time, underneath you,theres a war going on. ROSE: Okay. Start from the beginning. I mean, if were going to go withthe living plastic, and I dont even believe that, but if we do, howdid you kill it? DOCTOR: The thing controlling it projects life into the arm. I cut offthe signal, dead. ROSE: So thats radio control? DOCTOR: Thought control. Are you all right? ROSE: Yeah. So, whos controlling it, then? DOCTOR: Long story. ROSE: But whats it all for?

If you dig deep enough and keepa lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.Political diaries,conspirisy theories, even ghost stories. No first name, no last name,just the Doctor. Always The Doctor. And the title seems to have beenpassed down from father to son. It appears to be an inheritance. Thatsyour Doctor there, isnt it? ROSE: Yeah. CLIVE: I tracked it down to the Washington public archive just lastyear. The online photos enhanced, but if we look at the original  CLIVE: November the 22nd, 1963. The assassination of President Kennedy.You see? ROSE: It must be his father. CLIVE: Going further back. April 1912. This is a photo of the Danielsfamily of Southampton, and friend. This was taken the day before theywere due to sail off for the New World on the Titanic, and for someunknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived. And here we are.1883. Another Doctor.  And look, the same lineage. Itsidentical. This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra on the very dayKrakatoa exploded. The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history.When disaster comes, hes there. He brings the storm in his wake and hehas one constant companion. ROSE: Whos that? CLIVE: Death.  CLIVE: If the Doctors back, if youve seen him, Rose, then one thingsfor certain. Were all in danger.   MICKEY: Come on, then.  CLIVE: If hes singled you out, if the Doctorsmaking house calls, then God help you.  ROSE: But who is he? Who do you think he is? CLIVE: I think hes the same man. I think hes immortal. I think hesan alien from another world.   ROSE: All right, hes a nutter. Off his head. Complete onlineconspiracy freak. You win! What are we going to do tonight? I fancy apizza.  MICKEY: Pizza! P-p-p-pizza! ROSE: Or Chinese. MICKEY: Pizza!    ROSE: Do you think I should try the hospital? Suki said they had ajobsgoing in the canteen. Is that it then, dishing out chips. I could do ALevels. I dont know. Its all Jimmy Stones fault. I only left schoolbecause of him. Look where he ended up. What do you think? MICKEY: So, where did you meet this Doctor? ROSE: Im sorry, wasnt I talking about me for a second? MICKEY: Because I reckon it started back at the shop, am I right? Washe something to do with that? ROSE: No. MICKEY: Come on. ROSE: Sort of. MICKEY: What was he doing there? ROSE: Im not going on about it, Mickey. Really, Im not, because, Iknow it sounds daft, but I dont think its safe. I think hesdangerous. MICKEY: But you can trust me, sweetheart. Babe,  sugar, babe,sugar. You can tell me anything. Tell me about the Doctor and what hesplanning, and I can help you, Rose. Because thats all I really want todo, sweetheart, babe, babe, sugar, sweetheart. ROSE: Whatre you doing that for? WAITER: Your champagne. MICKEY: We didnt order any champagne. Wheres the Doctor? WAITER: Madam, your champagne. ROSE: Its not ours. Mickey, what is it? Whats wrong? MICKEY: I need to find out how much you know, so where is he? WAITER: Doesnt anybody want this champagne? MICKEY: Look, we didnt order it. MICKEY: Ah. Gotcha.  DOCTOR: Dont mind me. Im just toasting the happy couple. On thehouse!  MICKEY: Anyway.  MICKEY: Dont think thats going to stop me.  ROSE: Everyone out! Out now! Get out! Get out! Get out!    ROSE: Open the gate! Use that tube thing. Come on! DOCTOR: Sonic screwdriver. ROSE: Use it! DOCTOR: Nah. Tell you what, lets go in here.  ROSE: You cant hide inside a wooden box. Its going to get us! Doctor!  DOCTOR:The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldnt get through that door,and believe me, theyve tried. Now, shut up a minute.  DOCTOR: You see, the arm was too simple, but the heads perfect. I canuse it to trace the signal back to the original source. Right. Where doyou want to start? ROSE: Er, the insides bigger than the outside? DOCTOR: Yes. ROSE: Its alien. DOCTOR: Yeah. ROSE: Are you alien? DOCTOR: Yes. Is that all right? ROSE: Yeah. DOCTOR: Its called the Tardis, this thing. T A R D I S. Thats TimeAnd Relative Dimension In Space.  DOCTOR: Thats okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us. ROSE: Did they kill him? Mickey? Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead? DOCTOR: Oh. I didnt think of that. ROSE: Hes my boyfriend. You pulled off his head. They copied him andyou didnt even think? And now youre just going to let him melt? DOCTOR: Melt?  DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, no!  ROSE: Whatre you doing? DOCTOR: Following the signal. Its fading. Wait a minute, Ive got it.No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Almost there. Almost there. Here we go!  ROSE: You cant go out there. Its not safe.    DOCTOR: I lost the signal, I got so close. ROSE: Weve moved. Does it fly? DOCTOR: Disappears there and reappears here. You wouldnt understand. ROSE: If were somewhere else, what about that headless thing? Itsstill on the loose. DOCTOR: It melted with the head. Are you going to witter on all night? ROSE: Ill have to tell his mother. Mickey. Ill have to tell hismother hes dead, and you just went and forgot him, again! You wereright, you are alien. DOCTOR: Look, if I did forget some kid called Mickey ROSE: Yeah, hes not a kid. DOCTOR: Its because Im trying to save the life of every stupid apeblundering on top of this planet, all right? ROSE: All right. DOCTOR: Yes, it is! ROSE: If you are an alien, how comes you sound like youre from theNorth? DOCTOR: Lots of planets have a north. ROSE: Whats a police public call box? DOCTOR: Its a telephone box from the 1950s. Its a disguise. ROSE: Okay. And this, this living plastic. Whats it got against us? DOCTOR: Nothing. It loves you. Youve got such a good planet. Lots ofsmoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins in the air, perfect. Justwhat the Nestene Consciousness needs. Its food stock was destroyed inthe war, all its protein plants rotted, so Earth, dinner! ROSE: Any way of stopping it?  DOCTOR: Anti-plastic. ROSE: Anti-plastic. DOCTOR: Anti-plastic. But first Ive got to find it. How can you hidesomething that big in a city this small? ROSE: Hold on. Hide what? DOCTOR: The transmitter. The Consciousness is controlling every singlepiece of plastic, so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal. ROSE: Whats it look like? DOCTOR: Like a transmitter. Round and massive, slap bang in the middleof London. DOCTOR: A huge circular metal structure like a dish, like a wheel.Radial. Close to where were standing. Must be completely invisible.What? What?  DOCTOR: What? What is it? What?  DOCTOR: Oh. Fantastic!   DOCTOR: Think of it, plastic all over the world, every artificial thingwaiting to come alive. The shop window dummies, the phones, the wires,the cables ROSE: The breast implants. DOCTOR: Still, weve found the transmitter. The Consciousness must besomewhere underneath. ROSE: What about down here?  DOCTOR: Looks good to me.    DOCTOR: The Nestene Consciousness. Thats it, inside the vat. A livingplastic creature. ROSE: Well, then. Tip in your anti-plastic and lets go. DOCTOR: Im not here to kill it. Ive got to give it a chance.  DOCTOR: I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peacefulcontract according to convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.  DOCTOR: Thank you. If I might have permission to approach?  ROSE: Oh, God! Mickey, its me! Its okay. Its all right. MICKEY: That thing down there, the liquid. Rose, it can talk! ROSE: Youre stinking. Doctor, they kept him alive. DOCTOR: Yeah, that was always a possibility. Keep him alive to maintainthe copy. ROSE: You knew that and you never said? DOCTOR: Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you?  DOCTOR: Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I mightobserve, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp shunttechnology. So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that youshunt off?  DOCTOR: Oh, dont give me that. Its an invasion, plain and simple.Dont talk about constitutional rights. I am talking! This planet isjust starting. These stupid little people have only just learnt how towalk, but theyre capable of so much more. Im asking you on theirbehalf. Please, just go. ROSE: Doctor!  DOCTOR: That was just insurance. I wasnt going to use it. I was notattacking you. Im here to help. Im not your enemy. I swear, Im not.What do you mean?  DOCTOR: No. Oh, no. Honestly, no. Yes, thats my ship. Thats not true.I should know, I was there. I fought in the war. It wasnt my fault. Icouldnt save your world! I couldnt save any of them! ROSE: Whats it doing?! DOCTOR: Its the Tardis! The Nestenes identified its superiortechnology. Its terrified. Its going to the final phase. Itsstarting the invasion! Get out, Rose! Just leg it now!  ROSE: Mum?   JACKIE: Oh, thereyou are. I was just going to phone. You can get compensation. I saidso. Ive got this document thing off the police. Dont thank me.        JACKIE: Darling, youre breaking up. Listen, Imjust going to do a bit of late night shopping. Ill see you later.Ta-ra!    DOCTOR: Its the activation signal. Its transmitting!  ROSE: Its the end of the world.  CLIVE: Theres no point creating a spreadsheet ifyoure going to spend summer money in winter months.  CAROLINE: Oh, my God! I thought they were dummies. I nearly had aheart-attack.  CLIVE: Its true. Everything I read, all the stories. Its all true.    DOCTOR: Get out, Rose! Just get out! Run! ROSE: The stairs have gone.  ROSE: I havent got the key! MICKEY: Were going to die!  DOCTOR: No! NESTENE: Time Lord.  MICKEY: Just leave him! Theres nothing you can do! ROSE: Ive got no A Levels, no job, no future.  ROSE: But I tell you what I have got. Jericho Street Junior Schoolunder 7s gymnastic team. Ive got the bronze!  DOCTOR: Rose!  DOCTOR: Now were in trouble.    JACKIE: Rose, Rose, dont go out of the house.   JACKIE : Its not safe. There were thesethings, and they were shooting! And they     ROSE: A fat lot of good you were. DOCTOR: Nestene Consciousness? Easy. ROSE: You were useless in there. Youd be dead if it wasnt for me. DOCTOR: Yes, I would. Thank you. Right then, Ill be off, unless, er, Idont know, you could come with me. This box isnt just a Londonhopper, you know. It goes anywhere in the universe free of charge. MICKEY: Dont. Hes an alien. Hes a thing. DOCTOR: Hes not invited. What do you think? You could stay here, fillyour life with work and food and sleep, or you could go anywhere. ROSE: Is it always this dangerous? DOCTOR: Yeah. ROSE: Yeah, I cant. Ive er, Ive got to go and find my mum andsomeones got to look after this stupid lump, so. DOCTOR: Okay. See you around.  ROSE: Come on, lets go. Come on. Come on.  DOCTOR: By the way, did I mention it also travels in time? ROSE: Thanks. MICKEY: Thanks for what? ROSE: Exactly.   &lt;Backto the episode listing '"
