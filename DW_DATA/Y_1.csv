20,close the door susan i believe these people are known to you
21,they must have followed you that ridiculous school i knew something like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long
22,and whats wrong with it
23,perhaps
24,i dont discuss my private life with strangers
25,you dont deserve any explanations you pushed your way in here uninvited and unwelcome
26,oh dear dear dear dear this is very
27,its stopped again you know and ive tried hmm oh you wouldnt understand
28,yes yes yes yes yes yes by the way susan i managed to find a replacement for that faulty filament its an amateur job but i think itll serve
29,what is he talking about now
30,you dont understand so you find excuses illusions indeed you say you cant fit an enormous building into one of your smaller sitting rooms
31,but youve discovered television havent you
32,then by showing an enormous building on your television screen you can do what seemed impossible couldnt you
33,not quite clear is it i can see by your face that youre not certain you dont understand and i knew you wouldnt never mind now then which switch was it no no no ah yes that is it the point is not whether you understand what is going to happen to you hmm theyll tell everybody about the ship now
34,yes yes ship this doesnt roll along on wheels you know
35,quite so
36,now now dont get exasperated susan remember the red indian when he saw the first steam train his savage mind thought it an illusion too
37,am i the children of my civilisation would be insulted
38,yes my civilisation i tolerate this century but i dont enjoy it have you ever thought what its like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension have you to be exiles susan and i are cut off from our own planet without friends or protection but one day we shall get back yes one day one day
39,no
40,you still think its all an illusion
41,your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance
42,i cant stop you
43,and by tomorrow we shall be a public spectacle a subject for news and idle gossip
44,my dear child of course they will put yourself in their place they are bound to make some sort of a complaint to the authorities or at the very least talk to their friends if i do let them go susan you realise of course we must go too
45,theres no alternative child
46,its out of the question
47,now youre being sentimental and childish
48,very well then you must go with them ill open the door

53,yes look up there they dont understand and i suspect they dont want to well there you are a new world for you
54,yes thats the immediate view outside the ship
55,you really are a stubborn young man arent you
56,they are saying im a charlatan what concrete evidence would satisfy you
57,eh doctor who whats he talking about
58,no
59,not until im quite sure its safe to do so well yes good yes it is its good excellent excellent youve got the radiation counter there whats it read
60,splendid splendid well i think ill take my geiger counter with me in any case so you still challenge me young man
61,youre so narrowminded arent you dont be so insular
62,yes weve gone back in time all right one or two samples and i shall be able to make an estimate with rock pieces and a few plants but i do wish this wouldnt keep letting me down however we can go out now
63,yes quite so
64,that is quite correct but your tone suggests ridicule
65,really where does time go then
66,youre not as doubtful as your friend i hope
67,if you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds and watch them wheel in another sky would that satisfy you
68,now see for yourself
69,well ive no more time to argue with you i must get some samples susan
70,oh dear its disgusting really
71,its still a police box why hasnt it changed dear dear how very disturbing

81,oh im sorry im sorry its all my fault im desperately sorry
82,look at those look at them
83,oh its hopeless hopeless even if we do get free we shall never move that stone
84,well you obviously are
85,no no dont waste time try those bones they may be theyre sharper perhaps

87,no no weve got to free you first youre the strongest and you may have to defend us
88,susan you have a go my arms are tired
89,and dont think of failing
90,well try and remember if you can how you and the others found your way here concentrate on that please
91,fear makes companions of all of us thats right

93,your companion referred to it hope hope thats right
94,there will be no fire

100,im all right dont keep on looking upon me as the weakest link of the party
101,what nonsense
102,oh sheer nonsense child imagination
103,im hot with all this exertion
104,i expect so
105,do you think i want to
106,you seem to have elected yourself leader of this little party
107,just so long as you understand i wont follow your orders blindly
108,arent you a tiresome young man
109,oh sheer imagination
110,i wont allow myself to be frightened out of my wits by mere shadows thats all
111,yes yes yes yes
112,it must have just been killed by a larger animal too
113,susan you stay here with me
114,silence were going back to the ship
115,what are you doing they must be out of their minds
116,what exactly do you think youre doing
117,one minute ago we were trying desperately to get away from these savages
118,im not a doctor of medicine
119,oh dont be ridiculous child
120,youre trying to say that everything you do is reasonable and everything i do is inhuman well im afraid your judgements at fault miss wright not mine havent you realised if these two people can follow us any of these people can follow us the whole tribe might descend upon us at any moment
121,and what about the old woman who cut our bonds you understand
122,youre not going to take him back to the ship
123,do you think so these people have logic and reason have they cant you see their minds change as rapidly as night and day shes probably telling the whole tribe at this very moment
124,get your hand off me
125,well i i was going to get him to draw our way back to the tardis
126,you dont expect me to carry him do you
127,oh very well
128,this knife has no blood on it i said this knife has no blood on it
129,it is a finer knife than yours
130,this knife can cut and stab i have never seen a better knife
131,this knife shows what it has done there is blood on it  who killed the old woman
132,you killed the old woman
133,is this your strong leader one who kills your old women he is a bad leader he will kill you all yes all  follow my example
134,dont struggle
135,this place is evil
136,we are making fire
137,dont stop
138,do you understand we are making fire for you
139,he is the least important because we can all make fire
140,give him a chance give him a chance let him show the tribe fire establish himself as leader then hell let us go
141,when are you going to let us go hmm
142,quench the fire take the fire away from them scaring them somehow
143,yes
144,oh how i wish
145,you know i cant do that please be reasonable
146,you see this isnt operating properly or rather the code is still a secret when you put the right data precise information to a second of the beginning of a journey then we can fix a destination but i had no data at my disposal
147,well of course i cant im not a miracle worker
148,well i got you away from that other time didnt i
149,its the only way i can answer you young man now now we shall see
150,now what does the radiation read susan
151,well i suggest before we go outside and explore let us clean ourselves up
152,now what does the radiation read susan
153,the heat must have been indescribable look at this soil here look at it its all turn to sand and ashes extraordinary how can shrubs or trees grow in soil like that hmm
154,its petrified how fascinating a petrified jungle hm extraordinary yes i must really investigate that couldnt have been heat then and age would merely decay
155,i dont know i dont know but i intend to find out
156,yes very pretty very pretty hm
157,yes its certainly alien to anything on your planet but youre wrong about one thing chesterfield this isnt like everything else the animal is solidified certainly but its not crumbly stone its metal yes it always was
158,why cant you imagine an animal unless its flesh blood and bone hmm no i tell you this is an entirely different formation i should say originally it was some pliable metal held together by a magnetic field or an inner magnetic field rather and it may have had the ability to attract its victims towards it if they were metal too
159,no certainly not
160,oh certain and you neednt look at me like that young man we started this journey far too hurriedly to make any calculations you know that as well as i do however were alive
161,well now are we ready
162,no not really not really whatever it was destroyed everything that was living but the planet is dead totally dead
163,what is it chesterton we really must get back to
164,no no no sign of life no just buildings magnificent buildings
165,i dont know i dont know whatever it was destroyed the vegetation here certainly hasnt damaged the city but theres no sign of life no movement no light no no i shall know more about it when ive been down there
166,now dont be ridiculous that city down there is a magnificent subject for study and i dont intend to leave here until ive thoroughly investigated it
167,yes yes yes all right then but i assure you im determined to study that place
168,very well then i shall look at it myself alone
169,yes yes shes convinced that someone touched her and i tried to make her see it wasnt possible but im afraid she wouldnt listen to me i wonder would you have a talk with her
170,yes you know sometimes i find the gulf between susans age and mine makes difficult understanding between us
171,oh would you thank you thank you very much id be grateful
172,youre quite right quite right
173,hmm oh
174,my dear boy these eternal questions of yours do i know where we are i suppose
175,you pushed your way into the ship young man
176,oh small
177,a very good idea im hungry
178,oh dear dear how irksome for you oh this stuff is very good this should cure it now not too much dear not too much
179,oh did you want something to eat what would you like
180,bacon and eggs
181,yes certainly certainly j62
182,l6
183,now now now dont be ridiculous
184,bacon and eggs
185,well
186,it shouldnt be its english
187,food has component parts dear boy flavours are rather like primary colours you know you blend two to achieve a third a fourth etc etc
188,susan would you like something to eat
189,oh child thats unusual i do hope your affects outside the ship hasnt affected you too much
190,right
191,the scanner
192,ah but the city i must see the city
193,i will not be questioned uninvited passengers i didnt invite them to the ship i shall do what i want to do
194,i dont know the power takeup was rising normally and
195,oh dont distract me please
196,yes i think youd better child
197,k7 ah yes of course the fluid link yes yes yes yes
198,oh no no need for that this is easily repaired all we have to do is refill it
199,mercury
200,no im afraid you cant we havent any at all
201,no
202,no it hasnt been necessary this hasnt happened before
203,no no we shall have to get some from outside
204,yes the city of course of course were bound to get some mercury there yes were bound to well i mean what else can we do hmm
205,yes indeed at first light then
206,oh quite so quite so
207,what is it chesterton
208,let me see
209,yes id like to run a few tests on those susan would you take these into the ship please
210,thank you oh and by the way did you remember the food supplies
211,yes ample ample
212,do you mind if i sit down for a minute i feel a bit exhausted
213,yes im just a bit tired it was a long journey and my legs are rather weak
214,no no no no i want to look around too i shall be all right thank you
215,would you lend me your arm would you susan thank you
216,wait
217,listen
218,quiet child now listen
219,its stopped now
220,measuring equipment but measuring what look here look at this drum the inks still quite wet
221,theyre intelligent anyway very intelligent
222,oh as if that matters what these instruments tell us is that were in the midst of a very very advanced civilised society
223,yes yes that explains a lot of things doesnt it a jungle turned to stone the barren soil and the fact that were not feeling well
224,yes im afraid so the atmosphere here is polluted with a very high level of fallout and weve been walking around in it completely unprotected
225,a neutron bomb yes it destroys all human tissue but leaves the buildings and machinery intact yes
226,we need we need drugs to be treated
227,for the fluid link yes yes im afraid i cheated a little on that i was determined to see the city but everybody wanted to go on and well to avoid arguments in short theres nothing wrong with the fluid link
228,abuse me as much as you like chesterton the point is we need an immediate return to the ship and i suggest we leave at once
229,very well you may stay and search for her if you wish but susan and i are going back to the ship now come along child
230,give that to me
231,give it to me i say
232,chesterton this is
233,child if only youd think as an adult sometimes oh very well lets go then lets go
234,well unless unless we get treatment we shall die yes we shall die    dalek 1
235,in a moment child the phial of drugs left outside the tardis remember
236,its possible that they may have been antiradiation gloves drugs i cant be certain but it does give us a chance the people here whoever they may be are very eager to get hold of them
237,whoever goes must be very careful as far as i can ascertain the creatures out there are the ones who dropped the box theyre called thals theyre mutations
238,no if they were drugs ive learnt quite a lot from the daleks
239,the daleks our captors here oh if i didnt feel so oh but i was right about the neutron bomb the daleks built this underground city as a kind of huge shelter
240,i dont know
241,susan
242,give me a little while and then we must go back to the ship
243,oh are we oh yes well we must leave here soon we must must leave yes
244,i cant understand why have they taken susan
245,or suspect them either
246,i tell you the daleks are brilliant people i think we ought to cooperate with them
247,take your hands off me how dare you shout
248,keep away from me
249,dont waste time
250,the point is how do we get out of here wait until the daleks open the door and force the issue
251,the floors are metal all the floors are metal
252,why
253,no i know you dont know i mean why do they use metal is it because it lasts longer or because
254,no no no now listen lets concentrate on the daleks have you noticed for example that when they move about theres a sort of acrid smell
255,its electricity i think theyre powered that way
256,no no i believe the daleks have discovered a way to exploit static electricity very ingenious if im right
257,precisely if im right of course now what do we know apart from guessing how they are powered
258,yes yes yes yes now chesterton do you mind concentrating young man
259,and what will it do young man hmm
260,ready
261,now all of you watch very carefully see that you notice every detail in that machine right    dalek 1
262,yes yes yes yes yes
263,if hes on time we have three minutes
264,hows the mud
265,very good very good idea
266,yes yes not too near the door we dont want to make him suspicious
267,yes yes quickly good child
268,mind your head    dalek 1
269,well done susan
270,are you all right susan
271,splendid splendid
272,yes
273,barbara susan give me a hand move it down gently  how is it
274,well cant you sound more like a dalek
275,thats it
276,dont worry well push you
277,no no no it wont be suspicious at all
278,its up to you now chesterton you have to do as little talking as possible
279,thats fixed the door
280,here let me help fix it
281,wait a minute there its free lift it from the top
282,chesterton try and force it up from the inside
283,theyre cutting through the door
284,yes but hurry hurry
285,theyve magnetised the floor you feel it
286,yes chesterton were not able to get you into the lift
287,well come on hes right
288,when we get to the top well send the lift back down for you all right
289,come on susan
290,oh maybe ten minutes if were lucky longer
291,susan its no good we cannot do anything for him now child
292,well never mind that now we must try and find a way out of this room
293,were right at the top of the building i can just see the surface of the city see over there theres the edge of the petrified jungle
294,a dalek
295,theyre walking into an ambush    dalek 2
296,yes but how dear boy
297,well yes
298,theyve magnetised it too come on lets try and force it open
299,its open ive done it
300,look what are you doing
301,well lets get back to the ship
302,susan
303,the thals are no concern of ours we cannot jeopardise our lives getting involved in an affair which is none of our business
304,good luck chesterton
305,fascinating absolutely fascinating you know these records must go back nearly half a million years
306,oh nonsense young lady your survival is all here what er is this a solar system
307,i see and this what is this planet
308,total oh you have records of other systems
309,yes i see i wonder if i could see the plans
310,i might be able to fix our position oh yes yes absorbing most absorbing
311,i say i say i think thesell interest you  look here this is these peoples ancestor the original thal male there was a neutron war here most died and the survivors mutated but in the case of the thals mutation came round in full circle then refined itself into what you see
312,yes yes it took hundreds of years of course in the second example our recent hosts the mutation has not completed its full circle why i dont know but do you remember that monstrosity we took out of its machine
313,this is its forebear
314,yes they called them dals then oh its all there every moment of it is skaroene history minutely but brilliantly recorded priceless absolutely priceless
315,yes they were the warriors then
316,undoubtedly
317,im very glad to hear hes improving well now im sure you all agree with me its time we went back to the ship now come along
318,and the daleks are not which is more important my child
319,why
320,but our fate doesnt rest with the thals surely lets leave well alone we have ourselves to worry about now come along come along wasting time
321,oh please come along oh by the way let me have the fluid link will you oh dear boy now please please come along you know i cant start the ship without it
322,hmm
323,no i cant my child and ive looked through all my spares and ive really discovered we do need some mercury
324,its put us in a bit of a jam i must get that fluid link back again im afraid my little trick has rather rebounded on me what you might call tempting providence chesserman
325,yes well at least youre not vindictive
326,hmm
327,yes hey i know that
328,i can assure you young lady i havent been wasting my time theres always a way
329,thank you my dear your faith is something that i prize very highly you all realise of course we cannot succeed against the daleks alone
330,we have a readymade army here the thals theyre strong and they have one great advantage against the daleks they can move so much more quickly
331,well thats all right young man the mind will always triumph with me to lead them the thals are bound to succeed
332,my dear child this is no time for morals they must fight for us
333,oh my dear young man i do hope youre not going to be difficult
334,its just common sense young lady ive been underestimating you
335,are you challenging me
336,quite so
337,we need action not arguments
338,hmm strange young man
339,yes well see
340,lets see what hes up to
341,if we get this intelligent anticipation we shall succeed lets see this now what is this area here
342,yes yes well now i suggest we split into two groups the one to distract the daleks on the city wall side and the others to try and force a way through the mountains
343,are we all agreed
344,hmm
345,can you see any way in at all
346,oh youll allow me will you
347,yes yes yes now the things we have to put out of action is the radio and television waves theyve obviously got complete coverage in and around the city
348,we must presume they dont leave anything to chance
349,then we must stop the pictures remember the daleks arent very mobile
350,and theres always value in surprise i know it looks difficult but we must try it my friends yes we must
351,never mind it gives us a better chance to get into the city unnoticed
352,oh i know its risky but well we mustnt diddle about here now i want to get to the east side of that antennae
353,hmm
354,yes yes i see well you go ahead will you go along child yes well show them a thing or two
355,yes
356,ah yes a single cable the whole city is powered by static electricity
357,the single wire you see round here there see and there that must be the answer
358,ah good girl now just take it over there thats it now look out
359,no just a minute now you go and tell your friends to stop flashing the light on the antennae because for all we know the daleks might have a beam to throw on them paralyse them kill them
360,we shall be all right now go along and tell them to move their position from time to time now hurry please
361,yes yes yes yes we shall be back before then now go dear dear dear that young man gets so agitated now ill tell you what well do well shortcircuit it to another conductor let me have the key of the ship susan will you the key of the ship dear
362,yes yes yes i can always make another one if necessary
363,now the powers running away thatll teach the daleks to meddle in our affairs
364,well of course
365,but my dear child dont you realise what ive done a few simple tools
366,a superior brain
367,but child look
368,and you in turn killed the thal leader in your ambush and you will be responsible for more deaths unless you help these people  dalek 1
369,thats sheer murder  dalek 1
370,you could live in the city and the others could but why do you have to destroy cant you use your brains for right
371,what are you planning
372,nothing can live outside if you do that nothing
373,when do you intend to put this into operation
374,this senseless evil killing
375,just a moment i havent told you how we came to this planet  dalek 1
376,and you took a part of my ship away from one of my companions the young man  dalek 1
377,can they get here in time
378,stop it please  dalek 1
379,chesterton come here
380,they were about to spread radiation into the air
381,yes  dalek 1
382,no doubt you will have other wars to fight chesterton come along my boy weve got work to do i want to look at the reactors and see if theres any radiation leakage
383,hmm oh yes yes yes of course come along come along
384,this is what they call a compensator my friend
385,the whole of it its useless throw it away forget it unless you want to live in a shell like our dead friends
386,to rebuild a whole new world how i envy you
387,oh no no im afraid im much too old to be a pioneer although i was once amongst my own people
388,no no thank you were much too far away from home my granddaughter and i thank you all the same its a nice gesture on your part you know this soil is not quite so barren as you think ive been making tests and even you might live to see and hear the birds amongst the trees you wanted advice you said i never give it never but i might just say this to you always search for truth my truth is in the stars and yours is here
389,no im afraid its out of the question but i might visit your grandchildren to find if theyve learned the secrets and if they have well who knows i might live with them
390,not yet but i have it safely here and theres no need to worry about mercury young man
391,come along my child im hungry
392,oh how stupid of me i very nearly forgot my specimens oh your hand sir  goodbye
393,i cant take you back susan i cant
394,my head
395,it hurts here
396,no i was hit on the back of the neck
397,no no the ship must have stopped and put us down somewhere
398,oh all these questions miss wright please
399,where is not as important as why young man i must go and check the fault locator again
400,you didnt touch the controls did you
401,i know susan wouldnt im worried about that child temporary lapse of memory
402,well yes yes anything may help
403,no no no
404,no its ridiculous
405,its not very logical is it
406,well as i said its not very logical
407,ive been very patient with you miss wright and really theres no more time for these absurd theories
408,yes or electric
409,thank you it wont take us long
410,yes well perhaps it would be wiser to check the fault locator first im glad i thought of that yes come along come along
411,oh yes these numbers keep blurring before my eyes thats all
412,well if you wouldnt mind standing in front of that indicator and what you will see will be a series of numbers
413,hmm are you all right child
414,hit where
415,yes rather like mine
416,no it didnt did it i must find out whats outside the ship susan stand close beside me will you
417,no indeed
418,thats very curious that cant be whats outside the ship this is a photograph
419,yes the planet quinnis of the fourth universe
420,did i ever tell you that the ship has a memory bank hmm
421,are you sure i thought i did
422,oh dont you know i thought you might be able to explain it
423,trying to confuse me eh
424,what is inside madam is most important at the moment
425,precisely i know now whos responsible you are you sabotaged my ship
426,youre the cause of this disaster and you knocked both susan and i unconscious
427,a charade you attacked us
428,and when we were lying helpless on the floor you tampered with my controls
429,no sir we checked everything you and i
430,blackmail thats why you tried to force me to return you to england
431,i know it im sure of it
432,oh
433,but
434,ive decided we need more time to think were all somewhat overwrought mister chesterton  miss wright susan
435,a little nightcap to help us relax and sleep
436,meaning
437,im afraid we have no time for codes and manners and i certainly dont underestimate the dangers if they exist but i must have time to think i must think rash action is worse than no action at all hmm
438,you mean to keep one jump ahead that you will never be you need my knowledge and ability to apply it and then you need my experience to gain the fullest results
439,one mans law is another mans crime sleep on it chesterton sleep on it
440,so it was you
441,its no use pretending
442,help him you saw him you saw what he tried to do
443,susan didnt faint it was you that told me she fainted and i very nearly believed you
444,matter matter young lady he very nearly tried to strangle me
445,oh hes playacting
446,not to me nothings happened to me this is a plot between the two of you to get control of my ship
447,cant you see ive found you out why wont you admit it hmm
448,i told you id treat you as enemies
449,theres no other way
450,that is my business
451,oh its all a charade
452,i see divide and conquer eh shes trying to poison your mind against me
453,oh yes i admit they were very smart
454,dont you see i wouldnt allow them to hurt you child theyre very resourceful and cunning and it only leaves me one recourse they must be put off the ship
455,i can and i must
456,dont underestimate my powers young lady
457,yes or it might be the earth in the twentieth century hadnt it occurred to you my ship is very valuable remember
458,put yourself in my place young lady and youd do precisely the same thing wouldnt you hmm
459,youre getting off the ship chesterton
460,yes now get up
461,if of course theyd like to confess to me what they have done to my ship i may even change my mind
462,the fault locator the whole of it
463,the whole area of the fault locator has just given us a warning
464,thats what it means child
465,no you mustnt be frightened of me not now please i cant explain but ive just realised the danger were in
466,hurry look we must pull him round you see that panel up there youve heard me refer to it the fault locator
467,if one small piece of apparatus fails a little bulb illuminates and tells me precisely where the fault is can you imagine what would happen if the whole of it lights up hmm it means that the ship is on the point of disintegration youre not to blame all four of us are to blame
468,oh a mere harmless sleeping drug
469,yes you rather suspected i was up to some mischief
470,im afraid i must have misjudged you both
471,well please go on counting now both of you listen can you concentrate
472,were on the brink of destruction so all four of us must work closely together we must find out where we are and what is happening to my ship
473,theres a strong force at work somewhere which is threatening my ship its so strong that every piece of equipment can be out of action at the same time
474,precisely we havent crashlanded otherwise i would have discovered that immediately and i dont believe theres an evil intelligence in the ship just at the same token i dont really believe that you either of you have been the cause of this trouble
475,i dont know but we must find out
476,but its impossible
477,yes the heart of the machine is under the column
478,the source of power you see when the column rises it proves the extent of the power thrust
479,can it be possible then that this is the end
480,we have ten minutes to survive
481,maybe less
482,oh its quite safe here this is where i stood when i tried the scanner switch
483,i dont know even where to begin chesterton if only i had a clue
484,it it what do you mean my machine cant think
485,yes it has
486,oh think not as you or i do but it must be able to think as a machine you see it has a bank of computers
487,yes
488,yes
489,ive been racking my brains i dont know
490,yes possible
491,well it would have to be a gigantic one a one as strong as a solar system
492,no no it couldnt if you felt the power dear boy you wouldnt live to speak of it youd be blown to atoms in a split second
493,well try it but were clutching at straws come
494,we have five minutes only when the end does come they wont know anything about it
495,i cant see any will you face it with me
496,yes we must solve this problem you know we must
497,yes then we have the sequence a planet a planet in the solar system getting further away blinding flash destruction yes of course its our journey
498,yes yes
499,of course of course
500,i er had hoped to reach your planet earth skaro was in the future and i used the fast return switch
501,well i cant very well see it without a light can i
502,strange
503,yes i see here it is  here you see now look theres the switch you see
504,well you merely press it down and its stuck it hasnt released itself
505,yes it must have been
506,hold that yes just a minute now yes there you are you see
507,the springs not connecting its come off the base
508,there we are take it out now luckily we can turn it over and now it should work there ah thats all right
509,yes we can all relax were quite safe now but it was a narrow squeak
510,yes my child
511,what happened it was the switch it was still in place you see theres a little spring inside it and it was stuck it hadnt released itself
512,well the switch hadnt broken down therefore the fault locator couldnt give us any recognition you see let me give you a demonstration  now look when i put my thumb on there the light comes on and it only stays on so long as my thumb is pressing that switch as soon as i take if off a little spring inside releases the switch here and out goes the light
513,precisely as simple as that you know my dear child i think your old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend well i think you were very brave and i was proud of you
514,yes i i er well
515,really and i always thought that you were a young man without any recrimination in you well as for you young lady well you were absolutely right it was your instinct and intuition against my logic and you succeeded i mean the blackouts and the still pictures and the clock well you read a story into all these things and were determined to hold on to it we all owe you our lives
516,id like to talk to you if i may weve landed on a planet and the air is good but its rather cold outside
517,yes you havent forgiven me have you
518,yes i suppose its the injustice thats upsetting you and when i made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected you very deeply
519,as we learn about each other so we learn about ourselves
520,oh yes because i accused you unjustly you were determined to prove me wrong so you put your mind to the problem and luckily you solved it
521,oh please yes do open the doors will you
522,oh by the way susan has left you some wearing apparel for outside you know we have a very extensive wardrobe here
523,yes i think theyre rather charming we must look after you you know youre very valuable yes
524,well i think thats absolutely splendid chesterton yes it suits you
525,always a trifle too big for me you know i acquired that ulster from gilbert and sullivan
526,yes why not  susan
527,yes oh a little bit out of breath oh thats quite understandable after all were several thousand feet above sea level
528,well i directed the ship towards earth and it looks as though ive been successful
529,that oh i cant see anything without my glasses anyway i dont like this place youll have to excuse me ive got a lot of work to do first
530,oh dear dear dear dear were always in trouble isnt this extraordinary it follows us everywhere
531,all the lights in the ship have gone out the whole circuit has burned itself to a cinder and added to that it affected the water we havent got any
532,oh the heating as well everythings gone to pot
533,serious are you telling theres no need for you to tell me that really
534,fuel now where on earth do you expect to find fuel here hmm
535,oh well i wish you luck
536,you stay with me child you might be able to help me
537,now susan go into the ship and fetch me the two l oh will you you know what it is even if i do find the fault i dont suppose i shall be able to repair it before it gets dark and then we shall all freeze to death
538,im afraid its going to need a new one dear its going to take me days oh well i dont know really i always seem to
539,yes
540,yes yes yes but its going to take such a long time time we dont have now the only chance is to try and get down to a lower altitude and you know before it gets cold and we
541,whats she talking about now
542,print what sort of print paws hooves what
543,and if it were that means theres shelter nearby
544,all right yes yes yes yes
545,thank you my dear

557,yes mongol fighting mongol
558,yes oh well yes well for an emissary of peace he has rather bloodthirsty habits doesnt he
559,yes messer marco it is different
560,that is true
561,oh indeed thats charming of you very charming of you it wont take me very long to repair a day or two but i assure you that i shall not hold up your journey any longer than is necessary
562,i see and you will be taking us along with you including the tardis
563,oh good good then i can work as we proceed
564,why not hmm
565,i see you saved our lives messer marco and the least we can do is to respect your wishes no one will enter the tardis until we reach lop
566,oh messer marco these waystations do you have many of these in cathay
567,yes
568,oh excellent excellent if youll pardon me i have a lot of work to do and
569,i dont wish to sit down i want you to call your guards off
570,no

591,please wait we must be careful
592,yes but its not pure water you see
593,i havent got any water dont you understand i wouldnt allow us to get into this state if i had water young man no this was the water that was running off the walls its condensation its unbelievable condensation do you understand
594,chesterton make him understand it was condensation off the walls and
595,you understand now
596,not too much steady
597,i think i can repair the circuit in a week maybe less
598,oh were always rushing around a good days rest would do us all a lot of good
599,oh rubbish
600,well
601,young man you have no concept of what is happening have you and you still dont seem to realise that youre speaking to a man of superior intellect  polo
602,it seems we shall be stopping here for a while it means i can get on with more work
603,repairing the circuit young man
604,dont you realise they will be much less vigilant i shall be able to sneak into the tardis no worry at all
605,a key my boy a key what use do you think its going to be to him hmmm and where do you suppose i got that from
606,i made it
607,on the night of the oasis only chance i had she knows all about it dont you susan
608,yes
609,well now let me think let me think yes they were some kind of sect why

613,dont worry child well find her dont worry
614,well it looks as though i must doesnt it what is it hmm
615,oh where

617,aha my friend and how long have you been lurking there hmmm
618,where is the cave of five hundred eyes
619,yes where is it
620,well how far is it from here
621,a mile a mile yes now you two go back in there and wait go along go along go along
622,never mind about him which road
623,yes all right if you insist then come along both of you quickly
624,how extraordinary look yes its quartz yes a mineral ore look you see the veins going through the rock structure and look how cleverly that face is carved so that at the eye the quartz is exposed now isnt that interesting hmm
625,hmm barbara oh yes of course yes yes we mustnt waste time no come on now lets see if we can find the spirits
626,a fools errand its a fools errand child thats what youve brought me on and i had so much work to do in the tardis now come along we mustnt waste any more time here barbaras probably in bed and asleep by now if you had any sense where both of you should be
627,hmmm
628,miss wright
629,it must be your imagination child these eyes didnt move its quartz
630,oh rubbish child
631,tegana
632,if you must know sir we are looking for miss wright
633,i think this is your answer we found it
634,im not afraid of ghosts
635,ian  ian
636,over here  ian
637,over here my boy
638,just this handkerchief we found that over there
639,this man thinks this cave is haunted
640,oh rubbish child rubbish
641,well what are you looking for chesterton
642,oh rubbish rubbish
643,what proof have you
644,the trouble is polos change of attitude has slowed down my progress on the circuit
645,well with a bit more time and a lot of luck i should say about another night
646,the following evening will even be better
647,yes and a jolly good riddance
648,what do you mean
649,its a pity there was any association at all that chinese child makes me nervous
650,she found out about the key
651,yes on the night that barbara was captured susan and pingcho thought barbara had gone down to the cave and met with an accident so they came looking for me just as i was about to enter the tardis it was then pingcho saw the key
652,there isnt very much more to do i wont be long keep your eyes open
653,no
654,that is what youll precisely have to do polo
655,put that key in the lock polo and you will destroy the ship then where will your precious khan be hmmm you need more than a key to enter my ship you need knowledge knowledge you will never possess
656,no understand no id let you wreck it first
657,let go of me
658,you poor pathetic stupid savage
659,yes i quite agree with you the ships waiting outside with the circuit finished and installed
660,oh that wretched child
661,oh my dear susan
662,yes and the only way i can see it is that we should have to capture polo
663,now just a minute first things first young man how are we going to get out of here and remember that guard is out there watching for us hmmm
664,thats a very good idea good
665,right
666,dont worry my child i think by the time ive finished with that gentleman hell only be too glad to let us go    episode five  rider from shangtu
667,well continue with our plan get the keys and get out of here as soon as possible
668,pardon me
669,well we look a bit silly standing here dont we
670,use the tardis
671,yes get out of here anywhere where its safe
672,if you believe that polo youre a bigger fool that even i think you are
673,well were not going to get very far with this overgrown bread knife we shall have to use more enterprise than this
674,no it wasnt the devils in the fire their leader was killed thats why they broke up and ran
675,and few expect to meet it hmm  polo
676,if that fool had any decency at all hed let us go
677,well then we must go on trying to escape the circuits finished and all we need are those keys
678,we sacrificed our freedom to save you
679,huh very noble of you im sure
680,thanks for nothing
681,and the keys to the tardis
682,strange that tegana should watch the fire a sort of menial job hed order a guard to do
683,would he
684,of course he was the bandit knew him im certain he did
685,yes and he had to kill him or be exposed
686,my ship
687,no no ssh ssh we mustnt be impetuous we must choose the right moment carefully
688,but thats three hundred miles away isnt it
689,i would have thought it was a physical impossibility
690,three hundred miles a days on horseback very few people can ride more than twenty five
691,and the tardis
692,well where is it
693,the tardis oh dear dear dear dear dear
694,polo
695,i thought you said the tardis was to be placed in the courtyard
696,where to
697,the stables
698,i could hardly have it placed in the hanging garden now could i what does he think it is a potting shed or something
699,yes of course i have
700,dear dear dear dear havent you any ideas
701,what on earth does that child think shes doing great olympus
702,there is no need
703,tell that man to take his hands off my grandchild
704,so long as youre safe susan thats all that matters
705,its all chinese very interesting its odd that a mongol should choose chinese architecture isnt it
706,what size are the grounds
707,yes well ones enough for me young man red white or blue
708,pray then what am i supposed to do sir
709,i shall do no such thing
710,well if it breaks my back then he can take all of me so why waste time on small items
711,oh do be quiet child im not going to make a spectacle of
712,yes yes yes ill manage it
713,its my back
714,its broken
715,i am not being impertinent sir im far from unwell
716,i am not a doctor of medicine sire otherwise i should be able to cure these pains
717,oh not another horse
718,i said i dont think i could get on another horse
719,in my present condition sir and what about that lump of yours hmmm
720,well hes lucky he wont be jogged about
721,thank you
722,very well very well
723,it must be borne with dignity sir
724,my game
725,please
726,ah yes it is sire yes
727,er thirtyfive elephants with ceremonial bridles trappings brocades and pavilions four thousand white stallions and twentyfive tigers
728,and the sacred tooth of buddha which polo brought over from india
729,im very much afraid all the commerce from burma for one year sire
730,the great khan is far too modest my lady
731,how charming
732,genghis khan no i didnt meet him but i have heard of him yes
733,oh then youve lost nothing sire
734,well one more game then and if you win you can take it all back again
735,well er marco polo has taken away my caravan and given it to you sire if i win perhaps i could have my caravan back again
736,but none of this is important to me sire you see win or lose you can have it all back again but if i win my ship tardis comes back to me hmm
737,no no no
738,yes marco were playing for the tardis
739,my throw
740,he gave me this a consolation prize a piece of his paper currency
741,whats the point weve tried everything
742,i always knew tegana was a twofaced villain
743,it wasnt just my ship then whatever doublegame tegana is playing he must have decided upon a long time before we appeared on the scene
744,hmmm
745,and thats why he delayed marco polos caravan to give noghai more time to move his armies nearer peking
746,yes but what you have to take into account where battles are concerned dear boy are its leaders kill the leader and where are you what happens the whole army dissipates itself into chaos and utter confusion its happened throughout your history time and time again
747,exactly and what could be a better answer then to disorganise everything here it gives noghai the perfect answer to overrun the country
748,yes weve all had it
749,guard open the door
750,well then look somebody must protect him
751,thank you
752,thank you
753,come along
754,no nothing to speak of the counters hardly reading anything shall we take a look
755,oh but i have
756,well at the moment its temporarily hors de combat
757,yes i dont think i dont see why not theres nothing no danger about come on lets go and have a look
758,what
759,well lets go outside and have a look
760,no impossible in this temperature besides its too warm
761,oh no no not at the moment child however inviting that water looks we dont know what sort of creatures might be lurking beneath its surface
762,i say what do you make of this chesterton fascinating
763,yes it is isnt it yes glass instead of sand eh intriguing intriguing my boy
764,or was the glass put here deliberately and if so why hmm
765,sea of acid astonishing you know in all my travels ive never come across anything like this before however susan wasnt harmed anyway
766,yes and if youd had your shoes on my boy you could have lent her hers you mustnt get sloppy in your habits you know good gracious
767,under acid more likely
768,oh yes it has occurred to me lets see what it is help me get this top off
769,yes
770,see that crack along there its where the acid must have seeped in
771,use that use that
772,yes and whatever it was wore it is similar to a human being hmm
773,yes well i think we ought to go back to the ship and try and find susan she should have caught up with us by now come along
774,good now perhaps we might learn who it is that uses these strange ships anyway lets get back to the ship and find susan later perhaps a little visiting i think
775,oh wretched child now wheres she got to i wonder
776,yes sand here and glass on the beach im beginning to think that sea of acid is a defence barrier
777,yes it would seem so
778,yes yes
779,yes now before you two get carried away i think wed better go and find susan hmm
780,excellent now i suggest we go different ways and meet back at the furthermost point which is probably round the corner there somewhere off you go off you go now
781,yes yes from what susan has described he was wearing a suit similar to the one we found on the beach
782,no no the man wearing the monks habit lives in this building
783,yes with one difference which is puzzling but revealing they died and were only prisoners
784,i shouldnt worry too much about that that young schoolmaster friend of yours is very resourceful whilst hes free our chance of rescue is still good
785,yes yes i want to know more about this planet your technology you say reached its peak over two thousand years ago
786,i see and in that case it was possible to eliminate evil from the minds of men for all time
787,when theyre replaced it would mean that your machine is irresistible and you can overcome and control the voords again
788,im coming child dont rush im coming well dont just stand there come along come along keeping me waiting
789,i dont know i dont know theres no substance here have a look round the side child go along
790,is it a circular barrier
791,no of course there wouldnt be the molecules would be at their weakest ha its fascinating chesterton yes ive got it ive got it you know i think a force barrier has been put up around the ship  arbitan
792,i know we have no choice but this whole affair is outrageous blackmail pure and simply blackmail
793,and another thing if you think im going to travel across that acid sea in one of these primitive submersibles youre very much mistaken
794,oh really
795,oh dont be ridiculous my boy this is a perfectly acceptable method of travel very compact and very neat sir if i may say yes
796,yes i cant imagine why barbara left of her own free will
797,it seems theres only one conclusion what ever it is thats behind that door must have taken her by force
798,no no no no dont let us be precipitous
799,very well but i say im sure its a mistake
800,oh sensuous and decadent but rather pleasant i say is that a pomegranate
801,extraordinary
802,its all most remarkable
803,truffles i do believe theyre truffles well well
804,so is his kitchen delicious
805,susan
806,susan i will not have you take advantage
807,well er yes perhaps but im afraid its not quite as easy as giving susan a dress out of that
808,well perhaps if i had to choose a well equipped laboratory with every conceivable instrument yes yes
809,hmm well we shall look forward to that
810,charming young man yes charming i think a study of this culture is going to prove very very fascinating oh dear me im tired you know
811,most refreshing
812,look at these exquisite glasses chesterton
813,now now child dont take it all we must leave some for barbara when she wakes up
814,whats the matter hmm
815,no theres nothing there i only mentioned it because i have rather a sore spot here myself
816,i dont think shes properly awake susan get me a glass of that fruit juice will you
817,here drink this
818,now youve broken it
819,this is going to test our hosts patience you know its one of a set
820,whats happened to her
821,ah here comes altos now perhaps he can convince you
822,yes yes well naturally were all glad that shes going to be all right so if theres nothing more we can do for her i suggest we get a look at the laboratory hmm
823,i think i shall find considerable scope here
824,what oh yes yes yes yes a simple toy im sure that will amuse you ah now this might be helpful
825,seeking their revenge are they poor creatures
826,were all meeting here shes bringing sabetha and that young man altos i questioned him and theres no doubt about it hes one of arbitans couriers
827,yes hes going with you certainly by the way i found these travel dials those repellant brain things didnt appreciate their significance fortunately
828,i will explain it all in good time ah here are the others
829,no wait now we have one key and there are three more to find
830,good idea
831,well we must presume something has happened to your friend eprin
832,ah yes the place you mentioned yes the highly civilised society now then ive decided to adopt his plan
833,yes precisely i shall try and find out whats happened to your friend eprin if hes alive make contact then we can all meet again
834,yes altos has shown me how to adjust mine
835,no i think it better if you travel with the main party child
836,yes yes i know susan but dont you see its better if we split our forces you see its a very dangerous situation and the sooner we get on with it the better for my part i know youll be well looked after and as for me well im going to a wellordered society and i think its the best and speediest way really
837,no
838,say five days
839,no i hope not put these on please
840,oh of course i will and you see that you take good care of susan
841,thank you my dear now off you go
842,goodbye my child
843,now quickly you must go and follow her
844,i quite agree with you my boy
845,yes so am i dear child so am i however we have some important work to attend to excuse me chesterton you and i must have a talk
846,i am that man
847,yes i have studied some my lord
848,thank you
849,my lords i cannot defend a man when i have not considered every aspect of the case i must have time to examine witnesses read statements and to prepare my case
850,thank you my lord
851,thank you
852,we shall see
853,ive been starting and studying their laws ever since i heard that eprin had been murdered
854,oh yes i had met him and arranged to take the microkey but something must have happened thats why he tried to take the key earlier than wed arranged
855,yes he must have told his plans to someone else and that someone else killed him and took the key
856,yes we shall need every minute of that now we must all take a task on murder i gather is very rare here now i want both of you to go to the library and find out all the case histories you can facts and figures
857,yes yes quite now off you go both of you and meet me back here in three hours
858,well you my child and barbara can be my detectives and you my friend
859,trust me
860,oh come now tarron were not dealing in magic you know its obvious to me the key must have been taken from this room
861,then would you mind telling us what happened after the alarm bell went please
862,precisely and i rather gather when we discover its location we shall also discover the real identity of the murderer
863,mister tarron i wonder if youd mind leaving us alone for a few moments wed like to discuss the aspects of this case
864,thank you
865,what
866,oh well elementary elementary
867,all in good time my child the important is i believe i know who did the killing
868,you see tarron never doubted that chesterton was guilty a grave error yes a very grave error
869,precisely but someone did it and we also know there was a third man in the room how he got in here we shall know in a moment now let us assume he was hiding yes behind this door now barbara you imagine that you are chesterton for a moment come here now please you look into the room you see a body on the floor what do you do
870,good right now let me see you do it theres a weapon beside the body do you examine it
871,good then you look up in front of you and you see exactly what you came here for the microkey unbeknown to you the third man comes out of hiding creeps up behind you and you are struck down so now he could take what he came here for he opens the case lifts the key the alarm bell sounds now he only has a few seconds so he conceals the key runs to the door opens it gets out and then closes it but he cant go any further because already the security guards and officials are on their way so he decides to pretend that he is first on the scene
872,yes
873,yes he went in killed his colleague heard chesterton in the hall hid behind the door and the rest we know
874,my dear child this is only a theory we must have proof
875,if tarron were to know that now his case against chesterton would be complete i cant prove at this very moment that chesterton didnt hide in its present location
876,i have a little errand for you and i think you will find it very very interesting
877,my lords let me begin by saying that the murderer is without any doubt in this chamber the trouble is hes not under arrest but my young friend here is
878,i can my lord you will know his identity in a moment i will now call my first witness thank you
879,and do you know where it is now
880,then please tell the tribunal where its present location is
881,where did you get it
882,is he here
883,then please point him out to us
884,and so you see my lords when sabetha was showing the court the microkey it wasnt in actual fact the one that was stolen from the vault
885,yes my lord and we returned to find the last one then they would all be returned to arbitan
886,oh come now surely you dont think that hes still guilty i admit that i resorted to a subterfuge when sabetha accused ayden of taking the key but i think the results justifies the means
887,yes my lord
888,i beg the indulgence of the tribunal and ask for time to produce new evidence
889,hmm oh its you
890,yes and you did an even better job for the prosecution my man
891,yes yes
892,goodbye
893,leave i cant leave now i must find new evidence and reopen the case
894,perhaps not perhaps not however child youre safe and well i wish i could say the same thing about chesterton
895,i hope so i sincerely hope so well well
896,ah then you can stay the execution
897,impossible
898,what else did he say
899,collect the key ah ha ha ha ha ha yes yes you understand the villain that planned all this the one who planned this whole affair is now planning to collect the key what a wonderful opportunity it gives us to catch him redhanded and to release chesterton
900,it had to be i knew it all along until we knew the culprit the information was no good
901,you should read pyrrho my boy he founded scepticism a great asset to your business
902,reading what are you talking about i met the man
903,there was no point in keeping them here so i thought it might cheer arbitan up to know that wed been successful
904,ah is that the authorisation
905,all we need now is the wrist strap you impounded from chesterton
906,our means of travel
907,show him
908,well one of them might have waited for me however i suppose id better join them
909,goodbye my friends
910,what on earth are you doing dear boy you frightened the life out of me
911,yes the forcefields been lifted and i peered in for a moment or two now everything appears to be all right
912,yes well come along come along youre all running around here like a lot of scared chickens
913,im here my dear chesterton sometimes you drive me round the bend i dont know
914,yes and i think its time now to go back to the ship
915,here and dont part with it until youre absolutely sure it goes into the right hands
916,and you accompany me my dear will you
917,yes yes
918,so when yartek gets the final key his power will be absolute
919,and our impulse to leave this planet would be destroyed
920,you heard about arbitan
921,give me the key we must have it destroyed
922,what you gave it away
923,my dear boy
924,theres not a moment to loose come on
925,to the moving wall
926,somewhere here somewhere here theres a small stone it moved under my hand
927,yes my child chase the others up will you
928,im glad to have this moment alone with you sabetha i want to speak of your father you know he was a very wise and brilliant man and i know how you felt when you learned of his death
929,no no i wouldnt say that his work will go on only not quite in the same way but i dont believe that man was made to be controlled by machines machines can make laws but they cannot preserve justice only human beings can do that now i only hope that youll carry on his good work please goodbye bless you my child
930,i dont care if she is interested in them i told her repeatedly not to go off on her own
931,the aztecs they knew how to build
932,yes i hope youre right these aztecs had some rather gruesome habits i should hate to be carved up on that by some aztec high priest
933,quickly
934,yes you push from the other side these tombs were designed to prevent grave robbers not to aid and abet them
935,the servants of whom sir
936,what is your name sir
937,and you are the high priest
938,you know where we came from
939,tell me is there a way through from this side
940,whats he talking about now
941,you know who he is
942,exactly
943,the aztecs always showed the utmost courtesy towards their intended victims
944,good gracious
945,autloc
946,charming
947,reincarnations can come out but human beings cant go in
948,thats one thing you mustnt do as yetaxa youre supposed to know everything if the aztecs decide youre not what youre supposed to be then we shall all die
949,as you said chesterton the local butcher
950,and barbara will appear and down will come the rains
951,o great spirit grant us this our wish that we may be your eyes and ears among the people to do our best and serve in all our interests
952,a wonderful performance my dear congratulations we now have everything we want exactly
953,yes you and susan here in safety and ian and i outside finding out about the tomb
954,oh i shouldnt mind them theyre far too bust timing their miracle
955,presenting barbara to the public one second before it rains
956,surely that is for yetaxa to decide
957,poor old souls they must be bored to tears doing nothing
958,what about
959,and what about her
960,what did you say her name was
961,of course
962,thank you mmm all the perfume of the gods i find this place delightful so restful

975,charming person
976,so intelligent and gentle
977,just a minute what are you supposed to do
978,do it man do it but dont interfere
979,theres no buts about it if human sacrifice is essential here and its their tradition then let them get on with it but for our sakes dont interfere now promise me please promise ill go and tell barbara
980,susan please go outside and dont let anybody in
981,theres to be a human sacrifice today at the rain ceremony

985,barbara no
986,barbara no

991,well young woman i hope youre satisfied a happy day for you
992,you wouldnt be advised would you oh dear me no you knew better

998,no thats just it you didnt think
999,im sorry my dear i didnt mean to be so harsh with you
1000,however whats done is done and now its up to you what happens next
1001,yes youll have to hold tlotoxl off
1002,no not to autloc

1004,exactly
1005,oh well ian can look after himself and i think i shall know more about the entrance to the tomb tonight ive met somebody who knows how the temple was built an aztec lady
1006,yes but really its up to you barbara were quite safe here as long as youre here so
1007,as yetaxa commands
1008,i think i know about it
1009,no no they call me the doctor i am a scientist an engineer im a builder of things
1010,yes there are one or two features inside the temple that intrigue me
1011,yes for instance the tomb is sealed now surely the builder had some way of opening it
1012,yes of course i dont wish to pry into family matters
1013,oh my dear how charming of you
1014,oh any time today
1015,yes and im sure thats true of you too
1016,oh but their minds are old cameca and thats something im sure yours will never be

1095,yes its bound to take him some time to get there and back
1096,hmm and the history
1097,no rewriting
1098,yes we can pull but i think wed better do it at an angle what we really need is a pulley
1099,i know but it isnt going to be easy
1100,my dear susan ill tell you how glad i am to see you later on come along dont waste time
1101,now this is not going to be so easy as you think young man
1102,yes well be careful
1103,cords old it might break no no wait lets do it at an angle come along
1104,thats it its safer
1105,right
1106,yes
1107,harder
1108,i think youre right
1109,oh now now now dont worry dont worry dont worry dont give up hope
1110,ian didnt hit him cameca
1111,yes and as ian has said he was in the garden i know and hes innocent
1112,yes butchered by ixta
1113,oh just something to take my mind off the problems
1114,it isnt just tlotoxl that we have to contend with he and his kind will destroy all this one day
1115,it isnt the will of yetaxa
1116,yes and yetaxa speaks for them but autloc is needed here and he wont go to the temple
1117,there you are my dear its nearly finished
1118,yes im sorry my dear
1119,for both of us
1120,he must do to safeguard his own beliefs
1121,youre a very fine woman cameca and youll always be very very dear to me
1122,theyre all busy at the ceremony and this is just the right time
1123,yes now let me see oh i think you ought to order autloc to release susan and ian
1124,yes itll only take me a moment to open the doors and then we shall all dash through there and
1125,oh my dear susan
1126,shes in there
1127,that was a very brave thing for you to do cameca but you cant stay here
1128,go quickly
1129,yes we did we had to
1130,yes
1131,he found another faith a better and thats the good youve done you failed to save a civilisation but at least you helped one man  barbara puts the ceremonial ornaments with yetaxas corpse and goes into the tardis the doctor nearly leaves the gem that cameca gave him but changes his mind and puts it back in his pocket
1132,we have a bit of a mystery my boy
1133,my instruments
1134,yes and those instruments say that were still moving
1135,yes
1136,yes
1137,hmm this says everything has stopped but the ship
1138,covered with static lets try it again susan
1139,yes or a magnetic field
1140,no i shant be happy until ive solved this little mystery
1141,youre still thinking about the experiences you had with the aztecs
1142,yes it all started out as a mild curiosity in a junkyard and now its turned out to be quite a quite a great spirit of adventure dont you think
1143,yes and that extraordinary quarrel i had with that english king henry the eighth you know he threw a parsons nose at me
1144,threw it back of course take them to the tower he said thats why i did it
1145,of course it was long before you appeared on the scene however now let us get back to this little problem open the door susan
1146,yes yes plenty of fresh air temperature normal
1147,precisely
1148,its a spaceship close the door susan let us be careful theres been some kind of catastrophe here
1149,i never make uninformed guesses my friend but certainly thats one answer oh dear dear dear what a tragedy you know shes only a few years older than susan
1150,why
1151,chesterton have you noticed anything about this watch  neither of them are working these are the nonwinding type a movement of the wrist recharges the spring inside for twenty four hours
1152,yes then suppose we say that theyve only just stopped now that would mean that the last movement of their wrists would be at least twenty four hours ago
1153,it doesnt make sense does it but the facts are all here i think it would be wise if we returned to the ship and left these people theres nothing we can do for them
1154,come along open the door susan
1155,tell me are you from the earth
1156,no no barbara i learned not to meddle in other peoples affairs years ago  now now now dont be absurd theres not an ounce of curiosity in me my dear boy tell me why are you in danger
1157,you mean they have some kind of power over your craft
1158,hypnosis do you mean
1159,well what then
1160,john
1161,you have additional crew i take it
1162,well it seems to me that theres nothing else i can do goodbye my friend bye bye my child come along susan
1163,oh perhaps its coming from inside the tardis
1164,good gracious theyve taken the lock
1165,and disturb the field dimensions inside the tardis we dare not weve been most effectively shut out
1166,who else
1167,i dont know and why have they kept those other two in captivity hmm
1168,what is happening my friend cant you control the ship
1169,which is your parallel thrust
1170,right velocity chesterton check velocity
1171,please go away
1172,right stabilisers maitland
1173,wheres your deflection rays maitland deflection rays
1174,well well see about that well see about that reading please
1175,jet jet course port now
1176,jet reverse starboard now
1177,barbara see that panel check status three lights normal
1178,boost engines forward thrust and lock
1179,well my friend are you feeling better
1180,yes well i rather fancy thats settled that little bit of solution you know i think these sensorites have found a way to take control of your minds
1181,no no i dont i think it was an exercise in fear and power
1182,yes and you found a way to resist them whereas maitland here his power to resist was taken from him
1183,yes theyre dangerous and cunning these people but thats not all things are very strange here you know they can control they can frighten and yet they dont attempt to kill you furthermore they feed you and keep you alive all this is most extraordinary
1184,tell me have either of you ever met any of these creatures or seen them
1185,id like to have a talk with him
1186,oh why not
1187,youre both being rather secretive
1188,cant you go faster susans in there
1189,now what is it get on with the job please
1190,anything but this awful waiting
1191,i dont know they must have made the journey before they were here before remember they took away the lock mechanism from my ship
1192,yes and now theyre coming back with what orders to take over our minds hmm or to kill us
1193,whats that noise
1194,my dear chesterton its our minds that they take over so we must presume that the brain is all important now let our own intelligence be our own defence and attack
1195,steady chesterton the calmer you are the stronger
1196,maitland maitland can you hear me fear my boy its loosened his mind it gives the sensorites a chance to control it
1197,oh ignore it maitland
1198,theres work to be done my boy work understand
1199,yes a door to be opened
1200,danger on the other side
1201,good good good
1202,now now now try and contain your emotions use selfcontrol otherwise it confuses the brain and leaves it wide open to an attack by the sensorites look at maitland here fear and inertia left him vulnerable
1203,but that cant be where barbara and susan are now
1204,but that man johns with them
1205,yes it might be possible for susans thoughts to reach out to the sensorites
1206,yes and theres that friend of yours you know john we must look after him let me see now of course they have a hold of his mind you know
1207,yes i wonder did susan release the pressure
1208,yes and that was a dangerous thing to do child because you were strongwilled and without fear they didnt harm you
1209,theres nothing wrong with that
1210,i  ian
1211,i see and now theyre trying to do the same to us we must get the lock of the tardis back have you tried talking to them
1212,yes we must try we must      sensorite 1
1213,would you like to look at that graph for a moment
1214,i just dont understand there must be a clue here somewhere there must be
1215,yes thats very interesting may i
1216,excuse me
1217,what what is this what was it chesterton said rich beyond the dreams of avarice yes of course of course i know what he found
1218,molybdenum its here in the graph but its all mixed up with the lines so it doesnt make obvious reading
1219,yes
1220,yes its used as an alloy in steel in fact this machine would be useless without it now let me see iron melts at one thousand five hundred and thirty nine degrees centigrade and molybdenum melts at two thousand six hundred and twenty two degrees centigrade so you know weve some idea yes i see now just what john found i wonder if he was excited yes that planet must be full of it full of it its a veritable gold mine
1221,the sick member of the crew try him
1222,do as i say
1223,this is all very well but i think we should try and contact them
1224,agree to what what are you talking about child
1225,are you saying youve made contact with them
1226,well of course we shall see them but they must agree not to harm us
1227,if they try to harm us then i shall fight them    sensorite 1
1228,so earth men have visited the sensphere  sensorite 1
1229,these people cannot possibly accede to your request its out of the question  sensorite 2
1230,now listen to me both of you youve taken the lock of my ship and i want it returned immediately  sensorite 1
1231,so they might have been referring to susan
1232,next time if there is a next time they might try and control your mind my child like theyve done to these two people
1233,no not unless they return what they stole from my ship
1234,oh my dear theyre not invincible oh no no no did any of you notice the peculiarity in their eyes
1235,its a fallacy of course that cats can see in the dark they cant but they can see better than we humans because the iris of their eyes dilates at night yes
1236,oh its all perfectly simple chesterton you see the sensorites eyes are the exact opposite to that of a cat the sensorites eyes were completely dilated that is enormous in light
1237,exactly and that is our best weapon the sensorites will be frightened of the dark
1238,i very much doubt my child whether they can see in the semidarkness
1239,naturally
1240,my dear barbara wouldnt you be afraid if you couldnt see your enemies hmm thank you for your admiration dear boy thank you
1241,telepathy you know telepathy isnt only a prerequisite of the sensorites i know sometimes what youre thinking
1242,my dear what
1243,well whats the message child
1244,agree to what
1245,there cant be air outside the spaceship
1246,we must
1247,do you think i dont understand trust is a twosided affair
1248,if you go with them then they will have all the advantage
1249,im sorry susan but i dont believe you have the ability to represent us thats all
1250,you will do as youre told susan come here
1251,this instant    sensorite 1
1252,susan go and join carol wait there i want to talk to you  sensorite 2
1253,whats that speak up  sensorite 1
1254,dictated to by petty thieves and my own grandchild
1255,what is all this setting yourself against me hmm
1256,oh i know you thought you were doing your best child in the circumstances but i think im a better judge of that
1257,my dear girl the one purpose in growing old is to accumulate knowledge and wisdom and to help other people
1258,if you behave like one yes
1259,yes and i assure you we shall make good use of that fact but not without discussions you will not make decisions on your own accord now do you understand is that quite clear well is it
1260,oh susan susan  sensorite 1
1261,good good now lets work together and see if we cant get the lock of the tardis back hmm  sensorite 1
1262,very well id like to talk to him face to face i want to arrange the release of this spaceship tell him were not pirates or plunderers theres only one treasure we desire from him  sensorite 1
1263,before we make this journey one or two questions  sensorite 1
1264,i merely want to know why you attacked maitland and the others  sensorite 1
1265,yes some kind of disease i imagine chesterton
1266,ah ha i thought so yes yes yes some kind of bargaining ahead of us  sensorite 2
1267,yes provided we can produce our side of the bargain thats the whole point of the issue well my dear reluctant as i am to leave you im afraid we have no alternative
1268,oh i shall manage come along my boy susan
1269,susan we cant do without you can we
1270,im glad to have left those silent people  sensorite 2
1271,it must be explained to them the disease if thats what it is isnt anybodys fault besides theres cures and preventives  sensorite 2
1272,you make it sound so very simple  sensorite 2
1273,not like who john
1274,it doesnt alter the fact that youre responsible for his condition i think its utterly disgraceful
1275,facts what facts sir
1276,very well
1277,molybdenum
1278,vintage water
1279,now sir let us talk of the future our future
1280,and the ordinary people
1281,yes does it affect the elders
1282,i wonder why not
1283,yes it er might be a clue but what i hope sir was this er that if my friends and i succeed where your scientists failed will you return the lock of my ship
1284,yes shes a fine young woman my dear chesterton are you all right
1285,is this a symptom of your disease
1286,why has it happened to him and not to us
1287,never the elders
1288,its incredible the buildup in body temperature this disease as you call it is it contagious
1289,i wonder is it a germ in the air
1290,i agree with you
1291,yes yes yes
1292,no no no no no no you had some of it
1293,i know he drank a different kind of water its the water
1294,well it depends on their resistance in time of course all will succumb
1295,no i cant this is all we have to go on send for your servant please
1296,its all right chesterton rest quietly this isnt a disease its more like poison
1297,please please
1298,now sir your indulgence
1299,well we must make sure no one drinks anything but the crystal water
1300,fine and can i work with your scientists
1301,splendid splendid
1302,as long as that then we have time i have chemicals and equipment on my ship return the lock and i promise you sir i will not only cure my young friend but all your people
1303,well do not delay any longer than is necessary please thank you now salt and water susan an oldfashioned remedy but im sure itll serve thank you now my boy
1304,come along old chap
1305,yes now i want you to drink all of this it isnt going to be pleasant but its all for your own good
1306,thats it
1307,but hell die
1308,just look at that young man ive done all i can for him at the moment given him salt and water hes been coughing his heart out i must have chemicals and equipment his death will be your fault and yours alone
1309,what is it now
1310,do you really mean you can hear their minds talking susan
1311,dont set yourself against me
1312,you fool
1313,its inhuman
1314,just monstrous
1315,theory
1316,i know we have no alternative but such outrageous behaviour oh forget it child now i want you to stay here and act as nurse watch his pulse rate will you and let me know immediately
1317,how are you feeling
1318,any pains elsewhere
1319,yes well you just rest there quietly yes well let him have all the crystal water he wants and if his breathing gets febrile artificial respiration now sir your laboratory and i only hope theres time to save him
1320,yes well i have to say very comprehensive now gentlemen time is not on our side i believe your people have been dying because there is atropine poison in the aqueduct water now allow me ive made a few notes here which might interest you now these are the symptoms atropine causes dilation of the blood vessels temperature rises and pulse rate becomes very rapid a rash may appear the mouth and throat both become extremely dry now what we have to do is this gentlemen isolate the poison and then prescribe the remedy  scientist 2
1321,yes well then we must try again
1322,ah yes you know a strange thing here is not all your people died  scientist 2
1323,yes but surely from different outlets  scientist 2
1324,because it varies from place to place and when you made your tests you didnt discover it
1325,yes but a happy tiredness my dear hows our friend
1326,yes you must expect that ah my friend youve prepared the antidote
1327,splendid now i think we ought to start making this in large quantities will you please see that that goes to the first elders room give it to my granddaughter susan
1328,yes well now we shall soon be off this planet
1329,oh courage my dear courage of course im rather baffled with this atropine poison because it only seems to appear in one part of the city or rather one reservoir at a time its curious
1330,oh yes thats a cure all right but then why cure something when we can stamp it out hmm
1331,whats that my friend
1332,i dont know he might be more lucid you know than one should imagine now im going off on an expedition and i want you to take note of what he says
1333,you see he knows his name now you stay with him i think hes getting better and im sure youre going to have a great future between you later on now after my little exploration
1334,im going to find the first elder scientist rather and were going off on an exploration it isnt dangerous of course but when i have solved my problem im sure we shall all be out of trouble
1335,its very gloomy
1336,but that must make it rather difficult for you the sensorites dislike darkness dont they
1337,well it may be because youve neglected it that the waters become poisoned
1338,return i dont want to return i havent just come here for a look im going in there
1339,and why
1340,oh but i have a torch
1341,indeed are there
1342,and not seen them
1343,yes i think you should return to the laboratory i shall be all right leave it to me will you i assure you
1344,is it yes i thought so atropa belladonna deadly nightshade
1345,yes strange indeed when you realise that i was at the mercy of that creature it was so dark in there it was invisible and it knocked me to the ground
1346,no no no something hit me under the heart and it was most unpleasant it was a good thing i sent you that antidote otherwise i might have been in a much worse state than i was
1347,what
1348,then its true true the water and those monsters in there and now it appears that theres someone among the sensorites that bear us illwill thats two separate enemies
1349,no no no no no dont mistake me the water and those monsters are distinctly connected ive more or less solved that problem but this sensorite whos against us is a much greater danger now i suggest we go back and try and find out which one it is
1350,youve been exerting yourself boy and naturally youre weak
1351,now now you must do as youre told and that is that isnt that one of the elders
1352,take it easy i want a word with him i say you sir sir id like a word with you
1353,most extraordinary he ran away from me
1354,i can assure you he was very mobile my child come along lets get into the first elders room come along
1355,yes strange indeed sir i tried to talk to him and he ran away
1356,my dear sir thats most civil of you i ruined my jacket down in the aqueduct but of course i have others on my ship thank you
1357,beau brummell always said i looked better in a cloak
1358,yes i did that but i didnt kill him
1359,just what i was thinking yes of course we have no wish to interfere in your affairs but the city administrator appears to have all the qualifications
1360,certainly sir my companions and i will pay a visit to the man john and note his progress
1361,well well what a happy scene
1362,im glad to see you dont bear a grudge against the sensorites for the past
1363,splendid now sir the antidote i wonder if
1364,and what is this little collection of things here
1365,i see
1366,yes now just a moment this is rather important this is a rough plan of the aqueduct
1367,is that so
1368,oh yes i have a couple of questions for him
1369,very valuable very valuable
1370,what about him what about him
1371,if this is true what you say susan theres trouble ahead for us that sensorite has power now
1372,yes i quite agree and the only way to get that proof is to go back into the aqueduct what about susan
1373,a good idea
1374,yes thank you
1375,yes and what we propose to do sir is to go down into the aqueduct find your enemies and stop them
1376,thank you were making progress
1377,i wonder sir could i ask you a small favour
1378,we have a companion a young lady on the ship is it possible for her to be brought down here in the sensphere
1379,splendid sir splendid
1380,careful
1381,yes yes splendid and remember dear boy that i shall be standing nearly next to you ive never liked weapons at any time however theyre handy little things tell me how long does this paralysis last
1382,fine fine these weapons are splendid sir and without a doubt theyll help us to make success
1383,yes and that brings me to another problem my granddaughter susan shes bound to want to come with us
1384,no i quite agree with you my boy we must go and not tell her and save any arguments i wonder sir would you mind keeping a small secret until were well and truly away
1385,yes thank you after all theres no danger now we have these protectors and im sure we can settle our little business in an hour or two
1386,oh excellent excellent my dear sir
1387,are you quite sure youre up to it
1388,splendid lead the way sir
1389,its only one of our troubles dear boy look at this map its no good to us look all the lines have been altered somebodys been jiggering around with it
1390,yes in time but have we got that time remember we brought no food with us and the only water available is that poisoned water out there with deadly nightshade a charming outlook
1391,courage my boy both hands come on
1392,are you sure
1393,it looks like a shoulder flash ineer yes just as i suspected it must be one of those survivors from the spaceship that exploded
1394,to hide and poison the water
1395,lets go and ask him
1396,no no my boy no no no no im marking these the sections the pipes
1397,yes perhaps theyre preparing an ambush
1398,i assure you dear boy my spirits couldnt be higher collecting evidence circumstantial or otherwise calculating it pursuing it until its inevitable its fascinating
1399,oh dont interrupt young boy its most irritating
1400,yes well its all right lets back up and perhaps we can jump out on them
1401,yes dont do anything to alarm them  man 1
1402,dead
1403,yes  man 1
1404,wouldnt you like to leave these tunnels and go out into the sunshine again  man 1
1405,oh yes definitely
1406,in case we have to make a run for it my boy
1407,we have a surprise for you the war with the sensorites is over
1408,oh yes
1409,so you had to blow up your spaceship
1410,thats quite understandable isnt it chesterton
1411,im afraid you misjudged us sir these people are part of the committee here to welcome you we all came down here to take you out again to the surface
1412,yes you deserve it sir so do your men and i think the sooner we take you out into the sunshine the better
1413,its all over now
1414,pitiful fellow oh i know he did your people incalculable harm
1415,no
1416,yes but the fact is you didnt kill him shows great promise for the future of your people
1417,whats the matter my child
1418,oh i dont know its rather a relief i think after all no one likes an eavesdropper about do they no i think you obviously have a gift in that direction when we get home to our own place i think we should try and perfect it
1419,i dont know my dear this old ship of mine seems to be an aimless thing however we dont worry about it do we do you
1420,good good
1421,always last i very nearly went off without you
1422,lets have a look at maitland and see him off shall we
1423,implying i dont
1424,so you think im an incompetent old fool do you
1425,since you are so dissatisfied my boy you can get off the ship at the very next place we stop i shall take you off myself and that is quite final carry on   a land of fear ltback to the episode listing
1426,its all right chesterton made the position quite clear now i have some work to do
1427,hush child say your goodbyes and remember we shall be leaving almost immediately
1428,enough time has been wasted bringing you back young man i have the universe to explore
1429,hmm still here
1430,quite unnecessary
1431,certain of course im certain if you doubt me take a look for yourselves
1432,thank you obviously youre still in doubt let us take a longer look through the trees hmm
1433,then i expect it is somerset my dear well if youre going be off with you
1434,its out of the question i refuse to leave the ship
1435,entirely different circumstances im rather tired of your insinuations that i am not master of this craft oh i admit it did develop a fault a minor fault on one occasion perhaps twice but nothing i couldnt control
1436,very simple quite simple
1437,yes yes well perhaps since you put it that way an hour or two wont come amiss susan bring my stick will you
1438,im going to see ian and barbara back home safely
1439,well
1440,are we going to stand here talking all night hmm hmm
1441,perhaps it was a rabbit do you know chestertons getting quite jumpy these days young man like him shouldnt suffer from nerves
1442,come here my boy where are we where do you live hmm
1443,come along answer my questions boy
1444,paris eh a hundred miles or so either way is to be expected after all its only a fraction of the distance weve covered its quite accurate in fact
1445,oh nonsense lets have a word with the boy now look here my boy hold still
1446,you dont say
1447,chesterton theres a house look straight ahead of us
1448,oh rubbish rubbish
1449,nonsense it was your idea to explore anyway besides that might be very interesting the walk will do us good
1450,it looks uninhabited i wonder if we can get in
1451,i say take a look through there will you i think your eyes are sharper than mine
1452,were in luck the doors unlocked
1453,help can you hear me
1454,yes thank you oh its most refreshing where are my fiends hmm
1455,oh oh very brave boy

1464,splendid splendid i was beginning to have my doubts i havent seen a soul for hours
1465,yes further than you would think
1466,oh so theyre not volunteers eh
1467,yes quite a responsibility
1468,yes i see you believe in drastic measures eh
1469,im sure youre very experienced at this job my man but as an impartial onlooker i think i might have a bit of an advice to give you
1470,well if you were to expend your energy helping with the road instead of bawling and shouting at them every few seconds you might be able to get somewhere good day to you sir
1471,well without any undue modesty yes now would you mind standing aside
1472,i am not in the habit of
1473,common fellow
1474,its the tenth time hes counted his wealth
1475,do any of you got any money hmm
1476,you want to leave here dont you
1477,well do as i say follow me
1478,were waiting for the eclipse look
1479,yes
1480,yes youve heard about it havent you
1481,yes its quite a phenomenon isnt it yes
1482,ah look look at the coin

1485,just there just there
1486,catch his spade stop
1487,good day to you sir pleasant dreams
1488,good evening
1489,yes yes very likely
1490,hmm oh no no i didnt
1491,yes splendid fellow you seem to be very interested in these traitors
1492,then perhaps you can confirm that newly arrested prisoners are taken to the what is it the conciergerie prison hmm
1493,yes i was thinking of something new along these lines
1494,thats very impressive
1495,yes im quite aware of that yes quite aware yes in fact its a post that i myself personally occupy
1496,dont apologise i want to try that on
1497,the price is of no matter i havent any money
1498,no no i though possibly we could arrange an exchange
1499,whats wrong with it
1500,a fancy dress my dear sir i doubt that youve seen a coat like it
1501,am i correct to assume that youre not interested
1502,have you had a similar coat like this in your shop
1503,then i can understand why there has been no call
1504,exactly of course
1505,you may have it providing you agree to let me have parchment and writing materials into the bargain hmm
1506,then we have a bargain my dear sir
1507,who is in charge of this prison hmm well speak up my man
1508,my credentials
1509,you were advised i forwarded the communication myself what if robespierre hears about this
1510,very well very well thank you yes you seem a capable man and im sure this misunderstanding is none of your doing
1511,of course of course and im glad we understand each other
1512,no thank you
1513,thank you citizen its all perfectly simple three traitors were brought here a man a woman and a young child they fled from my province im sure you remember them
1514,well if theyre still here
1515,what by whom
1516,yes
1517,yes of course if course and the man you havent mentioned him
1518,well come along out with it man
1519,yes yes yes i believe what you say im sure you did the best you could its a pity youre surrounded by such fools
1520,yes all three of them are somewhere in paris
1521,yes yes what oh of course yes yes of course of course well ill take up no more of your time citizen
1522,well er home
1523,yes yes i could do that
1524,a great help very well
1525,i welcome the opportunity thank you before you question me perhaps you would like to hear my views on paris
1526,just today
1527,oh i wouldnt say that
1528,oh youve reached that conclusion hmm well perhaps we have fewer enemies in our region and it maybe that paris can take an example from us hmm
1529,is there such a need citizen robespierre hmm i mean what can this reign of terror possibly gain for every opponent you put to the guillotine two more will spring up
1530,oh you do do you
1531,do they or is it just their wish to keep their heads hmm
1532,no we didnt did we and i was so looking forward to it its a pity we talked for so long about paris
1533,i didnt say half the things i wanted to say he twisted my words
1534,oh i think not no nom no no your hospitality has been most successful and most accepted no i think i must bid you goodbye and leave you
1535,then convey my apologies to him
1536,its out of the question
1537,definitely no longer
1538,im sure it will be
1539,oh thats alright jailer i dont think i shall stay after all
1540,no im sure lemaitre will understand its a pity that i asked him to put me up besides those poor soldiers will need their rest
1541,nevertheless i must be on my way i have a long journey so kindly give my regards to lemaitre
1542,and just what do you think youre doing jailer hmm
1543,and what do you think hell say when he hears you delayed me hmm
1544,very well ill stay then and i shall say nothing of this disgraceful behaviour if only for your sake
1545,i did not the bed was hard and the draught blew through the room like the north wind
1546,yes i dare say you are but if i catch rheumatism apologies wont cure it will it hmm
1547,most appropriate
1548,whats that
1549,my dear barbara
1550,you should know by now young lady that you cant get rid of the old doctor as easily as that     barbara
1551,shes here
1552,is she well
1553,good well now we must find chesterton and try and get back to the ship
1554,hmm
1555,oh yes
1556,oh dont blame yourself barbara as it happens everything has turned out very well might have taken us ages to find each other
1557,well my voice seems to carry some weight hmm
1558,yes its rather impressive isnt it now listen im going through that door give me a few minutes then i want you to go through the door and straight out of the prison
1559,absolutely serious but ive no time to explain just do as youre asked
1560,well ill look after her and follow later
1561,now now now theres no buts dont argue you know my plans always work perfectly hmm in a few minutes then
1562,oh dear dear dear how irritating and i did want him so urgently
1563,no no no this matter cant wait its urgent ive just been interrogating that young woman and im convinced shes a member of that dangerous traitors party
1564,and do you know she could tell us the names of every traitor in this country
1565,no no chance of that no shed rather die first than betray her friends no i think if theres only some way of using her if only we could get through her to her friends
1566,hmm
1567,perhaps what
1568,my dear what an excellent idea what an excellent idea yes of course now why didnt i think of that yes thats what well do and lemaitre will be delighted now look here mister jailer i want you to open those prison doors keep out of sight
1569,tch tch tch no buts no and sooner or later that young woman will come through those doors and we can grab her go along quickly
1570,susan susan its me child me
1571,oh i cant explain that now child itd take too long
1572,yes well ive taken care of that she should be out of the prison and well on her way now and i shh theres someone coming quiet see you later shh
1573,shh
1574,me certainly not
1575,but i was under the impression my dear man that you were doing so im hardly dressed in the proper clothes to go skulking after people now am i
1576,well why didnt you say that in the first place well did you
1577,no and what do you think lemaitre will say hes bound to want to know whose idea it was
1578,ill try now dont worry ill cover up for you but you know i have a feeling that this young girl is tied up in this somehow now i think if we let her go i personally could follow and then arrest all of them all i need from you is the key to that childs cell
1579,lemaitre lemaitre why cant you use your own initiative my man
1580,i demand you open that cell door
1581,i shall have you out of here soon but i must have your help now look i want you to get down onto the floor behind this door and dont move whatever you do
1582,do it now child dont argue do it now and dont make a sound stay there theres someone coming
1583,yes yes dont fuss
1584,oh hes not back yet then eh
1585,hmm jailer jailer that young girl shes gone
1586,shes gone
1587,oh spare your breath please im quite capable of explaining the situation myself
1588,i must insist that you release that young child immediately
1589,position sir do you realise who youre talking to
1590,no should i
1591,do you know thats the biggest fairy story ive ever heard in my life
1592,yes why didnt you
1593,its become quite obvious to me why you didnt wish me to leave the prison
1594,but you relaxed the regulations today and i could have walked out any time i wished
1595,so you knew all the time
1596,what do you want
1597,the least i can do is listen
1598,i have never met the man oh i fully appreciate why you must want to find him but if you think that i am going to betray him then you are a very poor judge of character
1599,never sir i refuse
1600,we came alone my boy we made a bargain let him speak he holds susan prisoner
1601,thats all very well lemaitre stirling or whatever your name is but the only reason i brought you here was to help susan and ive kept my part of the bargain
1602,i certainly will not i want my granddaughter out of that prison
1603,but look here
1604,very well very well if you must tell your story then get on with it
1605,nonsense its far too risky
1606,quite so and theres susan to think about
1607,our only concern now is susan
1608,oh save your breath my dear do as you think fit im going off for susan
1609,hmm
1610,go with him my boy you cant help me but at least you can make sure that he helps us
1611,what is it what do you find so amusing hmm
1612,ive told you of our position so often
1613,the events will happen just as they are written im afraid so and we cant stem the tide but at least we can stop being carried away with the flood now susan and the prison
1614,i think were going to have quite a storm
1615,hmm weve waited around here long enough its far too conspicuous i think the carriage might be here when i return will you be all right
1616,i think ill go and get susan or at least try be careful
1617,i can see you did not expect me
1618,really i see you havent heard the news yet my man
1619,yes and lemaitre was shot trying to run away
1620,shot and now were going to deal with his accomplices
1621,why do you think a highranking official like myself came to paris hmm i was part of the plan i came to make sure of robespierres downfall
1622,no you didnt did you and that is why you didnt expect me to come back you thought youll get away with it
1623,being lemaitres accomplice take him you were lemaitres accomplice werent you you did help him to carry out his torturous actions
1624,orders orders dont tell me that my man i was there remember i saw you conniving with him all the time
1625,didnt what
1626,it was you that betrayed me to lemaitre was it not
1627,well i suppose theres some logic in that i cant decide whether youre a rogue or a halfwit or both ha however i will give you the benefit of the doubt  get out now while were reconsidering the post of jailer you may stay here in a temporary capacity
1628,i hope not now robespierres friends smuggled him away after the convention the soldiers are after him he will be caught and probably brought here
1629,tomorrow there will be a new bunch of prisoners robespierres friends so i hope everything will be ready including the cells
1630,certainly now let me have the key to the dungeon
1631,ah there susan were all going back to the ship its all over for you
1632,well barbaras outside and ian should arrive at any moment we have a carriage waiting
1633,yes i
1634,theyve just heard about the downfall of robespierre a sort of celebration you know
1635,yes yes susan the rabble are far too busy to bother about us everybody lived in fear yesterday of that man and today lets go susan lets go
1636,now come along dont stand around its too dangerous
1637,well i can assure you my dear barbara napoleon would never have believed you
1638,well its hardly fair to speculate is it no im afraid you belittle things our lives are important at least to us but as we see so we learn
1639,well unlike the old adage my boy our destiny is in the stars so lets go and search for it   planet of giants ltback to the episode listing
1640,we shall soon see
1641,whats the matter my dear
1642,oh something overheating here just as well were landing susan check the fault locator please
1643,oh no no of course not its just well there we were in the late eighteenth century and i tried another frequency to sidestep the ship back into the middle of the twentieth century
1644,whats happening  close the doors please we havent materialised properly quickly
1645,dont argue dear boy its an emergency close the doors
1646,were just landing
1647,what
1648,oh please dont bother me
1649,susan go back to the fault locator and i want you to check everything child do you understand everything
1650,oh dont be childish they opened the doors opened before we properly materialised
1651,what
1652,oh dont go on with these futile questions please cant you understand cant you see
1653,we were just about to materialise when the doors opened and we hadnt properly adjusted
1654,no thats impossible
1655,oh please dont keep talking on the twentieth century level im talking about time travel neither of you can understand what im talking about i can see that
1656,my dear boy
1657,there must be something wrong susan i shall have to check that fault locator myself to make sure excuse me
1658,well happily no harms been done its most puzzling oh my dear barbara was i rude to you just now if so im so sorry i always forget the niceties under pressure please forgive me
1659,thank you well i suppose everythings all right and you see the temperature there its quite safe to go outside oh susan just turn on the scanner and lets try and see where we are
1660,did you notice the way it blew out
1661,like something too big for its frame
1662,but yet i dont know that cant be right
1663,oh no no no dear boy no its most puzzling of course but now we dont know whats behind those doors
1664,yes i wonder why the well we must see
1665,yes please susan but all of you cautiously please
1666,the space pressure was far too great whilst we were materialising the strange thing is that we all came out of it unscathed its most puzzling its a big mystery my boy come along
1667,now why wouldnt the scanner show us all this hmm
1668,yes i suppose so it could be what a strange rock formation
1669,chesterton here come here look here is that cement
1670,rather a rough kind isnt it
1671,yes its manufactured anyway to hold the stone in place you know to fix it firmly beneath
1672,yes its all most odd isnt it most odd now barbara i suggest that you and i take that path and susan and you sir go that way
1673,yes yes
1674,what a snake
1675,wait wait wait yes i think its dead
1676,no eyes no head you see the skins interesting isnt it
1677,yes its a down you see
1678,oh no no no its quite dead no no death you see has its own particular posture and appearance yes yes lets go a bit further
1679,well here we are then this is the tail end of it and i know what it is its a huge earthworm
1680,yes there are no earthworms this size on your planet
1681,you know except for its size i could swear that it came from your world well lets go on come along
1682,oh no we wont no and im determined not to go back until we discover something more definite at the moment we only have one phenomenon and this mystery
1683,well all this maze youre talking about you know i admit its a bit haphazard but it seems to have some kind of pattern about it and this pattern suggests to me that theres a brain with a purpose behind it all come along
1684,well now this is interesting this has been cut by a manufacturer look out
1685,that was a near miss it would have given you a nasty headache
1686,you can see quite clearly what this is its a matchstick
1687,no it doesnt just look like one it is a matchstick
1688,dont you see that huge earthworm and now this cant you see whats happened hmm
1689,we have been reduced roughly to the size of an inch
1690,you me all of us and the ship
1691,whats happened
1692,well someone picked it up i suppose
1693,no no now please no let me do it you might hurt yourself you just let me hmm
1694,yes yes
1695,im all right yes well it looks a tremendous distance to me theres a house over there and theres a man sitting down reading something its a notebook i think
1696,how do i know
1697,yes i suppose so watch what youre doing will you
1698,gently gently gently weve got to find chesterton
1699,courage my dear i know all this is a bit of a nightmare but weve just got to get ian back and then we can go back to the ship
1700,of course yes ill try theres always a chance but first things first we must find chesterton we cant go back that way we must go back the same way that we came
1701,its not moving
1702,its perfectly stiff
1703,ha what an aweinspiring sight now what chance would human beings have i really wonder in the world of creatures like this bee hmm
1704,take a closer look
1705,its the same distinctive aroma
1706,i wonder what it is that could kill off nature like this
1707,well we must presume that it can so no eating or drinking until weve done our very best to find ian hmm
1708,sounded more like an ancient cannon
1709,yes rather widespread im afraid
1710,yes i wonder i wonder
1711,whats that smell cordite gunpowder hmm
1712,you werent with us chesterton but every insect we came across is dead
1713,yes and we dont know what it was that killed them that man hes been shot murdered
1714,quite so both are vital to the growth of things however we must leave this simple mystery and get back to the ship as i said my dear its fortunate for all of us that everything is dead
1715,and whatever you do dont look into the cats eyes close your own if you want to
1716,dont relax one swipe of its paw would smash us to pieces
1717,no im afraid not
1718,its out of the question my dear how can we possibly communicate with them
1719,yes and i would add another and more important factor the people who live in this house are murderers or one of them is therefore we cant expect sympathy and understanding from an insane or a criminal mind
1720,well what can we do my dear i mean surely this is the question normally i wouldnt hesitate but the destruction of the life force is frightful there it is i mean what can we do as we are
1721,well shall we proceed
1722,oh theyre all right theyre all right its a pity they didnt come this way though
1723,no no its dangerous lets go over to that pipe there
1724,are you sure you saw one of them pick up the briefcase and go into that building behind us
1725,phew awful smell of chemical in there
1726,no i wonder if that pipe extends into the room where that briefcase went
1727,yes yes of course my dear theres no other way if you go in there youll see its all corroded so theres plenty of hand and foot holds that chemical smell means that its germfree
1728,well if it is i shall have to give up and im not going to give up before ive tried and remember you must think of the other two they must be constantly reminding themselves theyre only one inch high theres only the two of us to help them
1729,yes yes yes go on
1730,yes im all right im coming my child im coming
1731,yes i know just leave me for a minute i shall be all right in a little while
1732,oh the smell of that chemical very nearly overpowered me
1733,well come to think of it our voices sound rather odd its this sink of course its all working like an echo chamber
1734,i dont know child i dont know
1735,you mustnt expect to hear their voices reply my dear this sink acts as a sound box its increasing the volume of your voice
1736,i dont know i dont know susan
1737,no no susan no our voices are much too high its a different frequency altogether my child dog might be able to perhaps but well try it again
1738,what uncanny good luck
1739,yes i know my dear i know
1740,good hes started now the sooner we get out of here the better
1741,oh its a sure way back down to the garden i do know that
1742,listen theres someone in the room someones come back into that room
1743,yes come along
1744,theyve put the plug back in again
1745,yes but if they fill that sink with any more water
1746,exactly
1747,there you are you see my friends you cant get rid of us as easy as all that
1748,perhaps
1749,well i think we should take a closer look at this oversized document the more we know about the enemy the better
1750,yes youre quite right my boy i only wish i could see it more as a whole
1751,let me have the notebook child now we shall have to make a map of this now chesterton you start marking off a section with your feet will you
1752,and susan and barbara i want you to call out to me what you see written beneath you
1753,this indicates the amount of organic esters
1754,my dear boy this formulas quite clear look with one vital difference the inventor has made the insecticide everlasting
1755,well given in sufficient quantity of course its capable of killing human beings
1756,yes or even coming in contact with it
1757,now now my dear gently gently
1758,yes now theres another point to consider my dear boy eating we cant even if we do find food here
1759,we can go back to the sink of course the water in the tap is quite safe
1760,ah but i want to go into that direction you see theres something over there that might be the solution to all this business
1761,a telephone my dear
1762,yes the thing is my boy how heavy is that receiver
1763,very well
1764,oh er oh barbara would you mind bringing another one of these please
1765,well we can manage you just sit down and rest for a while hmm      susan
1766,well i dont think barbaras quite up to it
1767,yes yes yes yes
1768,quickly
1769,theres nothing i can say dear boy barbaras quite right
1770,yes thats it well cause trouble start a fire my boy
1771,well we can try anyway theres nothing like a good fire is there
1772,come on all together
1773,yes i think thats got it in about the right angle the gas jet
1774,oh no no ive had a good look at this this is pressurised its a spray can our problem will be to get away far enough when it explodes
1775,oh yes its going to explode and when it does itll go off just like well to us a thousand pound bomb
1776,no no no dear boy try hitting the box at a sharper angle more force more vim hmm
1777,come on lets light the gas jet turn it on
1778,yes very well and what infernal machines those zeppelins were
1779,its worked its worked come on all of you back to the ship susan take care of barbara quickly quickly
1780,yes i know it is i know all about it
1781,youll be surprised go on lead on
1782,got to repeat exactly the things that happened to us when we landed
1783,yes that seed over there by the chair take it over to that table so that we can all see it wrap that round it when you do it
1784,yes yes weve done it yes weve done it
1785,no no my dear boy no look you see it hasnt vanished at all
1786,well well here we are then the patient is beginning to look her usual self again
1787,not at all my dear boy always at your service
1788,well im happy to say our plan worked we didnt have to fire the laboratory but we did attract attention do you know a policeman came into that room just as i was about to climb down that pipe
1789,yes theres your answer my dear
1790,the same seed
1791,completely my dear now before i get up and see where we are i suggest you all go and have a good scrub hmm off you go
1792,take a look for yourselves
1793,well it looks like moving water to me it might be a river somewhere i dont know whats the reading susan
1794,well i dont want to boast but we might be somewhere in london hmm
1795,well there we are back home your planet
1796,more by good luck than judgment what a horrible mess
1797,its uncanny wonder which era weve landed in
1798,oh im just wondering about the time factor my boy
1799,well i hope for both your sakes were near your time but bear in mind we might have landed in the early 1900s or the 25th century
1800,yes thats the word i was looking for decay its most odd most odd
1801,well you take this bridge now it isnt an easy task is it look at all this neglect all over the place its been abandoned all of it
1802,perhaps perhaps
1803,oh my dear now believe you me i wouldnt spoil your homecoming for all the world
1804,be careful my child
1805,yes youre always dashing about arent you youre far too curious
1806,the ship chesterton the ship dont go to near my boy its not safe
1807,yes well its all crumbling
1808,yes its going to be very difficult but remember were in london
1809,well the people theyll all be curious theyll want to know why were trying to break into a police box
1810,yes exactly
1811,oh my dear boy you cant just whisk up men and material out of the thin air now can you hmm
1812,you know my dear boy i never fail to be impressed by your optimism you cant move that by sheer brute force you were right you need a cutting flame
1813,its intelligent thats good but you know young man i have a feeling or call it intuition if you like i dont believe were anywhere near your time the 1960s
1814,yes well ask yourself here we are standing by the thames and weve been here quite a while how long quarter of an hour twenty minute
1815,well what have we heard nothing precisely nothing no sound of birdsong no voices no sound of shipping and not even the chimes of old big ben its uncanny uncanny
1816,oh so youre sitting up and taking notice again are you
1817,no no harm done child no harm done no do you realise we cant get into the ship whats all this rubble then look at it
1818,we shall be as quick as we can and you bathe that ankle what you need is a jolly good smacked bottom come on
1819,lets take a snoop
1820,im not a halfwit
1821,chesterton come here
1822,what a musty smell this place hasnt been used in years
1823,whats that monstrosity out there
1824,whats happened to london dear boy is more to the point
1825,whats this then
1826,theres so much rubbish its a jungle here
1827,it looks like some sort of adornment but what for
1828,no i think theres something more to it than that you know i think that this is an extra ear ideal for picking up highfrequency radio waves
1829,yes something like that
1830,well whatever it is i wouldnt like to meet one of these fellows you know
1831,right dear boy come on
1832,except you i think wed better pause in this search and get back to the others come along
1833,it might have been something to do with that gunfire we heard across the river
1834,well lets wait and see hmm
1835,yes but arent you even a bit curious after all its your city you know dont you want to know whats happened to it
1836,hmm
1837,evening look how filthy that water is
1838,hmm what
1839,huh stupid
1840,well i repeat its stupid a stupid place to put a poster right under a bridge where nobody can read it or see it
1841,a dead human body in the river i should say thats near murder isnt it hmm
1842,hmm
1843,yes now never mind about that flying saucer my boy that suggestion of yours about the plague supposing one of thems been in that water theyre bound to be contaminated with some sort of bacteria
1844,no the smell of its enough anyway let us go further afield come along come along now i suggest that you go up that way then i go
1845,we can go back down there hmm
1846,what else
1847,leave this to me dear boy i think youd better let us go
1848,not for long
1849,die and just who are you to condemn us to death  i think wed better pit our wits against them and defeat them
1850,resistance is useless surely you dont expect all the people to welcome you with open arms
1851,conquered the earth you poor pathetic creatures dont you realise before you attempt to conquer the earth you will have to destroy all living matter
1852,my dear boy what in skaro was a million years ahead of us in the future what were seeing now is about the middle history of the daleks
1853,look theyve taken some more prisoners what is so different about the daleks oh i see you mean the discs on their backs
1854,yes yes quite so but remember this is an invasion force therefore they have to adapt themselves to the planet
1855,only on the surface my friends
1856,i had a good look into that corridor did you notice the television eyes round about
1857,no
1858,yes nevertheless it has possibilities
1859,my young friend dont be so pessimistic what is your name by the way
1860,well mister jack craddock dont be such a defeatist our job is to try and get out of here and quickly
1861,yes quite so
1862,yes that explains your poster dear boy germ bombs hmm
1863,suppose we forget all this blab about bedfordshire have either of you seen this
1864,hmm let me have that bar up there for a moment will you
1865,i should say it was more advanced than that well now lets try a little experiment
1866,you see it responds magnetised
1867,now thats a very good question dear boy suppose you were a dalek and you found yourself locked up in this room how would you get out
1868,my dear young man the daleks have only feelers no hands and they use their brains not brute force
1869,now thats the very word a key in a crystal box you open the box take out the key and use it that is precisely what the dalek would do
1870,look at that little light up there
1871,quite let me have that thing will you
1872,yes that thank you
1873,my dear boy if they had to deal with a man of your talents they need hardly fear need they now do sit down and rest please oh dear now where were we ah yes of course yes yes yes now x equals gamma that means roughly two and a half percent so that should give us a curve of around about eighty degrees oh by the way did you take three dimensional graph geometry at your school hmm
1874,what a pity what a pity we shall have to boil this down now shant we well now then lets see well start third from the left and then ill follow it from the right and straight over all right now put that bar there and watch your eyes because you know it might be nasty are you ready
1875,hold that and shut up will you pay attention let me have the bar please
1876,only sometimes dear boy whats happened to your memory dont you remember we know that the daleks can use static electricity
1877,yes and we happened to outwit them too please go away will you oh dear dear dear dear now all we have to do is to slide this bar back here and the selfsame bar slides back into place here through electricity
1878,precisely now i want you to give him a hand in a minute just turn that pole under there will you there you see
1879,yes precisely now weve created a force field right now turn the pole round give him a hand quickly come on
1880,yes there are very few of us left now lets get out and be crafty
1881,let go of me take your hands off me
1882,no no please what are you doing no let me go now let me go
1883,susan
1884,goodbye my friend goodbye
1885,this is a time i should have my stick
1886,oh i think thats quite enough to start with you know i never realised that walking was so difficult so exhausting
1887,yes i think it is
1888,in quite a while i might be able to travel
1889,i dont care what that young man says i make the decisions here my dear and i think we should make our way back to the tardis
1890,do you question my authority child
1891,you seem to place more reliance on that young mans word than mine dont you
1892,ah hmm me
1893,yes well er yes yes of course young man yes well i suggest that as soon as im able to walk again we should travel north then we might be able to join up with the resistance party mark you its only a suggestion i really should leave it to you you know think it out for yourself
1894,what
1895,yes i think its a very good idea
1896,i think we should get on our way
1897,oh dear ghastly well i must say this is a nice state of affairs weve barely covered a mile and here we are hiding down the sewers again
1898,you do realise of course we shall have to let them both come down before we decide to defend ourselves
1899,oh yes just one the others bound to return and bring back reinforcements
1900,well is everybody alright
1901,no tyler no i never take life only when my own is immediately threatened now then let us make our way to this mine and then we shall know how to deal with these daleks leave this creature to his own devices and salvation come along you lead the way my boy come along
1902,smells familiar round here
1903,ah yes my dear
1904,quite quite i can see somethings cooking
1905,most useful
1906,susans a very good cook
1907,hmm
1908,well its quite obvious to me its the centre of their operations
1909,yes quite you know you surprise me tyler why didnt you concentrate your efforts here
1910,no i think perhaps it might be the answer to the question as to why the daleks are here
1911,oh no it goes much deeper than that you see man to them is just a work machine an insignificant specimen that is not worth invading absolutely useless it doesnt matter to them whether you live or die
1912,well at the moment my boy im not quite sure but let us say something that this planet contains something that no planet has
1913,yes quite quite instead there they are burrowing like moles down and through the crust of the earth
1914,not unless they know how to control the flow of living energy hmm
1915,yes they dare and we have got to dare to stop them
1916,hmm
1917,i certainly have not ah good there seems to be a way down there
1918,yes well lets have a closer look
1919,how many bombs have you got left
1920,yes well that should be enough now you see that mast over there
1921,and the cable behind it
1922,well i want you and susan to walk around the lip of the crater and sever it use the bombs detonate with your revolver right
1923,off you go and dont stop to pick daises on the way
1924,thatll be harder to guarantee come along get down
1925,shall we go in
1926,thank you but dont call me doc i prefer doctor do you mind
1927,apparently things are on the move
1928,my dear barbara
1929,the magnet the magnet quickly
1930,but why
1931,well we must prevent this barbara if they succeed it will the mean that theyll upset the entire constellation weve got to prevent it
1932,by keeping the daleks here keep your eyes skinned on the door
1933,now i wonder can i do anything with this scanner
1934,oh yes susan and david now theyre trying to fracture the outer cable ring
1935,well if its possible you see we might be able to immobilise the daleks  dalek
1936,theres nothing we can do my dear just watch and wait we cant contact them from here
1937,a chance yes
1938,not now barbara we dont know how long this little trick of ours will hold the daleks we may have to find something else
1939,yes thats brilliant my dear good carry on
1940,turn on the daleks turn on the daleks kill the daleks do you hear
1941,my dear boy where did you spring from
1942,well the people are fighting back at last
1943,i dont think their device will succeed in that position but still it will be a gigantic explosion
1944,yes i quite agree
1945,in that my dear impossible theres something new for you tyler a volcanic eruption in england
1946,yes its unbelievable
1947,yes and its to them that you must dedicate your next task the rebuilding of the earth and im sure youre going to make a great success of it
1948,just the beginning just the beginning all alone eh susan hmm
1949,yes i afraid weve had so little time for that sort of thing lately
1950,i er well im sorry susan
1951,oh my dear susan youre hurt
1952,oh dear dear dear
1953,dear dear dear i shall have to mend this shant i now
1954,oh no no no no no worry my child no when ive finished with this it will look as good as new
1955,yes hmm
1956,yes you little monkey you know since youve been away from that school you seem to have got yourself thoroughly disorganised havent you yes you need taking in hand well i er i think i must check up on the ship if you dont mind
1957,during all the years ive been taking care of you you in return have been taking care of me  susan
1958,chesterton come here
1959,what a musty smell this place hasnt been used in years
1960,whats that monstrosity out there
1961,whats happened to london dear boy is more to the point
1962,whats this then
1963,theres so much rubbish its a jungle here
1964,it looks like some sort of adornment but what for
1965,no i think theres something more to it than that you know i think that this is an extra ear ideal for picking up highfrequency radio waves
1966,yes something like that
1967,well whatever it is i wouldnt like to meet one of these fellows you know
1968,right dear boy come on
1969,except you i think wed better pause in this search and get back to the others come along
1970,it might have been something to do with that gunfire we heard across the river
1971,well lets wait and see hmm
1972,yes but arent you even a bit curious after all its your city you know dont you want to know whats happened to it
1973,hmm
1974,evening look how filthy that water is
1975,hmm what
1976,huh stupid
1977,well i repeat its stupid a stupid place to put a poster right under a bridge where nobody can read it or see it
1978,a dead human body in the river i should say thats near murder isnt it hmm
1979,hmm
1980,yes now never mind about that flying saucer my boy that suggestion of yours about the plague supposing one of thems been in that water theyre bound to be contaminated with some sort of bacteria
1981,no the smell of its enough anyway let us go further afield come along come along now i suggest that you go up that way then i go
1982,we can go back down there hmm
1983,what else
1984,leave this to me dear boy i think youd better let us go
1985,not for long
1986,die and just who are you to condemn us to death  i think wed better pit our wits against them and defeat them
1987,resistance is useless surely you dont expect all the people to welcome you with open arms
1988,conquered the earth you poor pathetic creatures dont you realise before you attempt to conquer the earth you will have to destroy all living matter
1989,my dear boy what in skaro was a million years ahead of us in the future what were seeing now is about the middle history of the daleks
1990,look theyve taken some more prisoners what is so different about the daleks oh i see you mean the discs on their backs
1991,yes yes quite so but remember this is an invasion force therefore they have to adapt themselves to the planet
1992,only on the surface my friends
1993,i had a good look into that corridor did you notice the television eyes round about
1994,no
1995,yes nevertheless it has possibilities
1996,my young friend dont be so pessimistic what is your name by the way
1997,well mister jack craddock dont be such a defeatist our job is to try and get out of here and quickly
1998,yes quite so
1999,yes that explains your poster dear boy germ bombs hmm
2000,suppose we forget all this blab about bedfordshire have either of you seen this
2001,hmm let me have that bar up there for a moment will you
2002,i should say it was more advanced than that well now lets try a little experiment
2003,you see it responds magnetised
2004,now thats a very good question dear boy suppose you were a dalek and you found yourself locked up in this room how would you get out
2005,my dear young man the daleks have only feelers no hands and they use their brains not brute force
2006,now thats the very word a key in a crystal box you open the box take out the key and use it that is precisely what the dalek would do
2007,look at that little light up there
2008,quite let me have that thing will you
2009,yes that thank you
2010,my dear boy if they had to deal with a man of your talents they need hardly fear need they now do sit down and rest please oh dear now where were we ah yes of course yes yes yes now x equals gamma that means roughly two and a half percent so that should give us a curve of around about eighty degrees oh by the way did you take three dimensional graph geometry at your school hmm
2011,what a pity what a pity we shall have to boil this down now shant we well now then lets see well start third from the left and then ill follow it from the right and straight over all right now put that bar there and watch your eyes because you know it might be nasty are you ready
2012,hold that and shut up will you pay attention let me have the bar please
2013,only sometimes dear boy whats happened to your memory dont you remember we know that the daleks can use static electricity
2014,yes and we happened to outwit them too please go away will you oh dear dear dear dear now all we have to do is to slide this bar back here and the selfsame bar slides back into place here through electricity
2015,precisely now i want you to give him a hand in a minute just turn that pole under there will you there you see
2016,yes precisely now weve created a force field right now turn the pole round give him a hand quickly come on
2017,yes there are very few of us left now lets get out and be crafty
2018,let go of me take your hands off me
2019,no no please what are you doing no let me go now let me go
2020,susan
2021,goodbye my friend goodbye
2022,this is a time i should have my stick
2023,oh i think thats quite enough to start with you know i never realised that walking was so difficult so exhausting
2024,yes i think it is
2025,in quite a while i might be able to travel
2026,i dont care what that young man says i make the decisions here my dear and i think we should make our way back to the tardis
2027,do you question my authority child
2028,you seem to place more reliance on that young mans word than mine dont you
2029,ah hmm me
2030,yes well er yes yes of course young man yes well i suggest that as soon as im able to walk again we should travel north then we might be able to join up with the resistance party mark you its only a suggestion i really should leave it to you you know think it out for yourself
2031,what
2032,yes i think its a very good idea
2033,i think we should get on our way
2034,oh dear ghastly well i must say this is a nice state of affairs weve barely covered a mile and here we are hiding down the sewers again
2035,you do realise of course we shall have to let them both come down before we decide to defend ourselves
2036,oh yes just one the others bound to return and bring back reinforcements
2037,well is everybody alright
2038,no tyler no i never take life only when my own is immediately threatened now then let us make our way to this mine and then we shall know how to deal with these daleks leave this creature to his own devices and salvation come along you lead the way my boy come along
2039,smells familiar round here
2040,ah yes my dear
2041,quite quite i can see somethings cooking
2042,most useful
2043,susans a very good cook
2044,hmm
2045,well its quite obvious to me its the centre of their operations
2046,yes quite you know you surprise me tyler why didnt you concentrate your efforts here
2047,no i think perhaps it might be the answer to the question as to why the daleks are here
2048,oh no it goes much deeper than that you see man to them is just a work machine an insignificant specimen that is not worth invading absolutely useless it doesnt matter to them whether you live or die
2049,well at the moment my boy im not quite sure but let us say something that this planet contains something that no planet has
2050,yes quite quite instead there they are burrowing like moles down and through the crust of the earth
2051,not unless they know how to control the flow of living energy hmm
2052,yes they dare and we have got to dare to stop them
2053,hmm
2054,i certainly have not ah good there seems to be a way down there
2055,yes well lets have a closer look
2056,how many bombs have you got left
2057,yes well that should be enough now you see that mast over there
2058,and the cable behind it
2059,well i want you and susan to walk around the lip of the crater and sever it use the bombs detonate with your revolver right
2060,off you go and dont stop to pick daises on the way
2061,thatll be harder to guarantee come along get down
2062,shall we go in
2063,thank you but dont call me doc i prefer doctor do you mind
2064,apparently things are on the move
2065,my dear barbara
2066,the magnet the magnet quickly
2067,but why
2068,well we must prevent this barbara if they succeed it will the mean that theyll upset the entire constellation weve got to prevent it
2069,by keeping the daleks here keep your eyes skinned on the door
2070,now i wonder can i do anything with this scanner
2071,oh yes susan and david now theyre trying to fracture the outer cable ring
2072,well if its possible you see we might be able to immobilise the daleks  dalek
2073,theres nothing we can do my dear just watch and wait we cant contact them from here
2074,a chance yes
2075,not now barbara we dont know how long this little trick of ours will hold the daleks we may have to find something else
2076,yes thats brilliant my dear good carry on
2077,turn on the daleks turn on the daleks kill the daleks do you hear
2078,my dear boy where did you spring from
2079,well the people are fighting back at last
2080,i dont think their device will succeed in that position but still it will be a gigantic explosion
2081,yes i quite agree
2082,in that my dear impossible theres something new for you tyler a volcanic eruption in england
2083,yes its unbelievable
2084,yes and its to them that you must dedicate your next task the rebuilding of the earth and im sure youre going to make a great success of it

2358,wasnt going to work what next i never had any doubt in my mind my dear
2359,this way child and try and be quiet the place is swarming with guards
2360,good good i expect ian and barbarall be wondering when were going to get back
2361,oh the great fire of rome my dear hmm
2362,yes a most memorable occasion
2363,hmm got it all wrong what do you mean child hmm
2364,of course not why should they
2365,i gave him
2366,its got nothing to do with me
2367,oh yes an accident
2368,well he could have he could have he would have been told someone else you cant possibly accuse me of that
2369,now look here young lady lets settle this insinuating that all this is my fault hmm my fault
2370,well well well well
2371,oh what zest what youthful exuberance try not to look at them child their outburst of energy could make you go dizzy
2372,my dear barbara the young lady doesnt want to listen to people who have been idling away their days
2373,well now youve had a nice long holiday im sure you cant wait to get back to the tardis hmm
2374,itll have to keep have a grape come along my dear
2375,hmm oh chesterton yes you know i wouldnt had thought it possible but somehow weve materialised for a split second of time and been imprisoned in some kind of force i simply cant break its hold somewhere somehow were being slowly dragged down
2376,all responses negative air thin and static hmm
2377,oh what is holding us here what force hmm
2378,hmm oh
2379,wrong my boy we�ve been dragged off our course the question is is it some natural phenomena or is it intelligent deliberate or for a purpose hmm
2380,what
2381,oh yes my dear yes i�m confident that i can counteract it with more power yes nowm let me see            doctor
2382,hmm
2383,oh
2384,oh she�s probably heard an extrasonic sound you know the thing that young people and young animals hear excuse me you�re in the way
2385,oh yes i quite agree i quite agree the power build up is strong enough yes quite satisfactory well now the motors wait a minute yes
2386,we seem to be caught trapped somehow is it some strange phenomena there�s no power in the ship it�s useless
2387,all right all right don�t snap at each other my dear
2388,you probably saw some cosmic ray which is causing the interference
2389,so disturbing all this interference
2390,i can�t understand it well there�s nothing for it my boy but we shall er it�s a matter of exploration we shall have to go and find the trouble of this interference and then learn how to counteract it
2391,quite so
2392,of course my dear it�s in the first aid box you know where it is there it�s facing you
2393,nearly done my boy hmm
2394,yes yes yes of course of course now then i want you to wear this adj
2395,it�s an atmospheric density jacket to be precise oh i see is the atmosphere a bit thin
2396,oh these are what they technically call a respiratory compensator
2397,exactly exactly
2398,ah dear dear dear dear dear hmm it�s one thing after another
2399,yes well i er i er i didn�t want to er
2400,this is not merely a decorative object come along come along
2401,well well well that is remarkable gracious during all my travels i don�t think i�ve ever come across this magical isn�t it extraordinary i say are you there chesterton chesterton what are you doing dear boy fiddling and gaping over there come over here and learn something look here do you see what this is mica hmm
2402,capable of withstanding great heat
2403,have you got something sharp i can have for a moment hmm
2404,that�s very clever very clever you know you�ve never done that before that�s a remarkable conjuring trick
2405,oh my dear man
2406,gold
2407,echoes dear boy
2408,hmm what sort of feeling
2409,no no no no no i can�t see any spooks or anything i don�t think so no not particularly no i must say that if i lived here and i heard you roaring your head off i�d probably come down and take a look at you
2410,yes what if the power�s that�s got hold of the tardis has taken your pen of course ha ha now then there�s something for us to solve come along come along come along
2411,yes but when it�s old so old look at the state it�s in
2412,no no pity well it certainly has nothing to do with holding the ship here dear boy
2413,yes it�s curious yes yes yes but we must find something more tangible hmm come along come along
2414,wait wait stop
2415,you�re a little premature let�s have your tie
2416,i know you�re not wearing one dear boy but the one round your middle hmm
2417,yes well that�s your affair not mine
2418,thank you now then
2419,yes let�s see
2420,there you are look see that yes there you are you see
2421,saved your life you were about to have a wash in there weren�t you or probably drink some of it we very nearly had the remnants of a coal hill school teacher in there instead of his wretched old ragged old tie
2422,yes lets see now now what have we got hmm echoes interference gold and now acid yes similar properties to formic acid yes it�s strange isn�t it it�s very strange
2423,a light is it a reflection from a planet
2424,now my young man if this is your idea of revenge for that tie then i think its a pretty poor effort
2425,it probably comes from some sentient thing or a machine operated by it we must find the source of this interference now come on
2426,they�ve probably left the doors open come on
2427,stand still
2428,i�ll go back to the ship and try and find something can you wait
2429,my ship my tardis
2430,are you all right boy
2431,it�s a little blistered
2432,what�s happened to that weed hmm
2433,went where
2434,yes a cursed place so barren i wonder yes cursed
2435,oh unfortunately i can�t help you at the moment dear boy
2436,and i have a shock for you the ship�s gone vanished
2437,its my chest
2438,oh yes
2439,yes it�s these adj coats are no use after about an hour they�re useless
2440,just about
2441,yes yes
2442,there do you see those ridges what are those ridges in the sand there have a look
2443,i heard the tardis
2444,the ground seems firmer here
2445,oh all so strange so unnatural i�ve never experienced anything in my life before like this but we must continue with our search
2446,take a look over there well that�s odd those are not track marks those are more like claw marks yes chesterton
2447,i think we�re on the right track my boy
2448,good gracious it�s hollow
2449,yes well preserved yes a vertebrate creature yes highly developed hmm
2450,menoptra yes does that word mean anything to you hmm
2451,no no my boy no but it�s this rock formation and now this creature this object it suggests the planet vortis
2452,the isop galaxy yes many light years from earth and yet the vortis hasn�t the moon�s and here there there are several look you see you can see for yourself
2453,oh yes yes yes but it would need a galactic explosion you know some kind of new force whether this vortis planet has that or not i can�t be sure anyway lets come on over here
2454,pulsating
2455,no look down there my boy hmm
2456,apparently so we�ve got to get down there i wish we had more knowledge of what we were up against ah this wilderness
2457,the best thing is just to stand still
2458,apart from rubbing our back legs together like some sort of grasshopper i doubt if we could get on speaking terms with them stand still obey these creatures on this planet are completely unknown to me just stand still and obey
2459,organic matter reproducing itself
2460,yes i wonder i wonder how long it�s taken to grow that size eh a hundred or two hundred years
2461,history doesn�t mean anything when you travel through space and time all right all right don�t push don�t push     one of the zarbi goes up to the tardis takes a step in then backs out again spinning wildly an alarm goes off then the doctor and ian entergt
2462,what�s the meaning of this child who tried to get in here
2463,what do you creatures want
2464,who are you we come in peace  animus
2465,it�s unbelievable unbelievable what did you do in the ship child what controls did you touch
2466,you have performed a miracle my dear you have realigned the fluid link the power is back
2467,trying to destroy my ship you will achieve nothing nothing i have great secrets in my ship we could help you          animus
2468,where is the fourth member of our party hmm well  animus
2469,let us go back into the tardis
2470,i�m just beginning to relax my boy
2471,er yes i think so yes i must do something about this face of yours
2472,yes it seems they�ve learnt their lesson here dab some of that on your face there�s some cotton wool there
2473,hmm
2474,well to use the term of earth i suppose we should call them insects
2475,size is only relative in this rarified atmosphere it appears that evolution has chosen that particular form of life on this planet
2476,yes
2477,well it�s this voice it�s this this this this this queen of the ants you might say if i can only trick her into neutralising this section of this area i want you to try and track down barbara hmm
2478,well it has something to do with this crater of needles
2479,the only clue i can give you dear boy it�s behind a great web
2480,no it isn�t come on give me a hand
2481,you leave vicki to me but when you do finally catch up with barbara see that she takes some she�s probably had the same experience with breathing as we have
2482,no no no no don�t unplug it you must never do that you must never break the time and relative dimension link come on
2483,oh it�s useless it�s useless come along put me through will you come along drop this hairdryer or whatever it is  animus
2484,it�s time you left
2485,come along cheer up cheer up my child it�s all right yes here have a piece of chocolate there you are
2486,oh come come come come you don�t have to worry about him he�s very good at this sort of thing yes he�ll be back he�ll be back
2487,hmm oh i�m trying to discover a little more about this invasion fleet my child the more we know the safer it will be for us  menoptra
2488,i�ll just turned up this booster wait a minute  menoptra
2489,yes that�s where they�ve taken barbara
2490,i am still here  animus
2491,yes i know my dear i know i think i�ve earned ourselves a little breathing space
2492,nothing nothing
2493,just about as much as i ever want to we�ll see come let�s look busy now i want you to nip into the ship and bring me back a little red box and in it is a recording compound you�ll find it on the left near the first aid kit go at once and come back immediately
2494,oh i said a white box child do you ever think this is one of my specimens look
2495,now take it back
2496,because i think we might find it more valuable later on child when ian and barbara have returned
2497,oh a hundred percent a hundred percent
2498,use the spider child    animus
2499,yes i know my dear i know
2500,i know be all right in a minute hmm
2501,just about enough for our survival if i tell them everything our usefulness will be ended now we�ve got to get out of here and i want to find a place to hide this recorder i don�t propose to make them a present of the place of attack
2502,yes there�s no doubt they�ve alerted their invasion forces they�ve acted very quickly on the little information that i gave them now while they�re busy i want you to nip back into the ship find my walking stick and bring it straight back here hurry
2503,now the question is how to make it safe hmm
2504,yes there�s no mistaking it my dear gold and something more than gold gold is the symbol of power on this planet which brings me to an incident with ian and his pen
2505,yes it flew out of his hand just as he was about to give it to me a gold pen now we have got to find something to realign this power
2506,yes that is the question isn�t it
2507,yes i think so my dear well now we know the tardis is the opposing force the question is which is the stronger hmm
2508,what will happen well the astral map will be ruined of course but i�m afraid we have no choice now just stand back a bit my dear
2509,it is still incomplete  animus
2510,ohh
2511,my dear you�re still wearing it
2512,oh yes we must capitalise on your action now we know the necklace no longer works on us perhaps the forcefield is being reversed i wonder if that is so i can control that necklace with this power of my ring
2513,now look look
2514,splendid splendid
2515,well i think we shall get our friend to take us out of here go outside jeep your eyes open
2516,yes it appears they have gone to the plateau
2517,now don�t count your chickens child there�s quite a lot ahead of us now go on cautiously
2518,oh most unpleasant oh well my dear so far so good hmm
2519,yes the zarbi�s left here to go to the spearhead it�s just about yes with luck we can follow their tracks
2520,let�s get moving  you may not believe it but you nearly ended up as lost property  and the same to you
2521,what
2522,oh yes i see i see
2523,well i haven�t noticed it before my dear but since you mention it no i don�t think so
2524,oh i�ll buy you a collar for him at the next stop but just you remember child if we lose him there�s about two hundred or more ahead of us just like that now come along come along
2525,no do not attack him he�s quite harmless
2526,my dear barbara where is chesterton hmm
2527,a most detailed report yes it�s interesting
2528,oh i don�t see why not my dear what is in the centre of the web hmm do you know
2529,where does it draw its power from hmm
2530,yes the magnetic pole i see i see you mean it draws and uses the power from the planet vortis
2531,yes i wonder why i didn�t realise that before the same force drew and holds the tardis here yes of course it�s remarkable most interesting
2532,the plan the plan yes my dear yes yes but with a slight difference
2533,yes i think we�ll go ahead with the mock attack as planned that will be your responsibility my dear a time we shall agree to
2534,that i shall take along with me the girl and i will return to the zarbi headquarters
2535,of course i don�t see why not
2536,thank you
2537,precisely come child
2538,oh now now now cheer up cheer up i don�t particularly want to go back there myself
2539,yes what is it what do you want excuse me well what do you want hmm
2540,oh you think so do you
2541,you do better than i
2542,to control him you will have to use my ring and that is of untold value
2543,no no my dear no
2544,our friend here has suggested that the creature goes along with your party
2545,hmm  here take it
2546,you may not use it and return it
2547,on your life return it
2548,leave it me child leave it to me
2549,we have been on a slight exploration  animus
2550,oh we we shall be taken to the centre child try try not to be afraid
2551,ah you never let me have the web destructor back again child we may not get another chance
2552,oh yes i gave it to you come along my child come along come along
2553,well where is it child
2554,this infernal light is too bright for my eyes
2555,there�s only one thing you owe me my friend
2556,that is my ring hmm
2557,thank you thank you
2558,well my boy we�ve managed to come out of this knot unscathed
2559,yes it�s quite a problem isn�t it it�s something to do with coal wasn�t it

2567,yes hes got a very bad wound here
2568,this belt wait a minute of course yes i remember this belongs to his royal master king richard hell certainly be glad to get this back again we should be able to get into his favour we shall need some assistance to help find barbara
2569,be careful my boy    ian
2570,yes well he should be better when we get him back to his own people
2571,are you all right
2572,well as i said before we must try and get some help from king richard this certainly belongs to him
2573,well at the moment we can do nothing further until i find some clothes for all of us to wear hmm yes now i think vicki and i should go down into that city and see what we can find now here child put on this cloak and itll help to act as a disguise
2574,its a good idea but be careful in the meantime keep your eye on that
2575,come along child
2576,no
2577,i know of the place well
2578,i am not a venetian neither am i a trader
2579,you have some very fine materials here

2592,it would be of little use a player king and a young woman sire
2593,our young friend is a woman sire have pity let us help her
2594,i think i know what he means sire here saladin mighty ruler and commander of huge armies believes hes captured you
2595,you could spread this tale by word of mouth and all the world would know that saladin fears you
2596,your messenger might offer to exchange a hundred prisoners for the knight he holds
2597,he might think you undervalue his men one hundred men to one of yours methinks a fair bargain sire
2598,we are your servants sire
2599,his voice has not yet broken your highness
2600,your highness come victor let us tend upon the others
2601,i certainly didnt like the way the chamberlain examined vickis clothes and come to think of it they were originally stolen from here
2602,you do do you then i suggest we get along with it
2603,how should i know dear fellow if the king wants you to surely thats good enough
2604,never mind the mights my dear just concentrate on what youre doing here we are now i think just the sword and youre ready
2605,oh the king will tell you that do you know my boy i have an idea that king richard still wants to send you to see saladin after all
2606,your royal commands have been carried out your majesty
2607,you are very gracious sire
2608,it is a kings prerogative to make yesterdays deafness todays keen hearing
2609,i hope you will find barbara safe and well dear boy er sir ian
2610,godspeed and remember be valiant

2614,really
2615,and a pretty poor garment too
2616,yes now there really is a point there isnt there if i stole from you my lord chamberlain how could i steal from him
2617,then how could i steal from him eh you blockhead
2618,oh how nice for you
2619,then whoever it was stole them from you must have sold them to you now dont you agree
2620,he must have stolen them from you
2621,now just a minute oh my dear chamberlain so undignified the merchant bought the clothes in good faith and paid for them in good money now please return his money
2622,now now now you mustnt let an honest man suffer pay him
2623,yes off you go off you go well we seem to have got out of that problem all right hmm     guard 1
2624,all right all right dont get so carried away my friend its a fine cloak youve done a very good job
2625,now the next question is what could you do for my boy hmm i want something of finer quality
2626,quite so quite so thank you thank you now run away and have a good think about it and let me know in the morning what youve decided
2627,im sorry my dear but you known how were placed here its its a hmm
2628,oh forgive me your highness this is my young ward having found ourselves in a hostile country i decided to use this disguise
2629,we are indeed grateful your highness
2630,can i help you madam
2631,may i ask why of all people here youve come to me hmm
2632,if there is a plan my lady i will find out what it is and keep close in touch hmm
2633,the household purse hmm
2634,well my dear in one way i dont think things have turned out too badly after all hmm
2635,you will be much safer under joannas wing
2636,of course my child
2637,only temporarily
2638,what a question
2639,ah now now now what is all this eh hmm
2640,ah surely you know me better than that child no my reservation was that i might get entangled in court intrigue and thats going to be very very dangerous very dangerous indeed
2641,i am indeed glad sir to know that you are thinking in terms of peace
2642,it is a good scheme sire if the princess agrees
2643,will she agree
2644,pretence sir heres an opportunity to save the lives of many men and you do naught but turn it down without any kind of thought what do you think you are doing
2645,with swords i suppose
2646,you stupid butcher can you think of nothing else but killing hmm
2647,i admire bravery and loyalty sir you have both of these but unfortunately you havent any brain at all i hate fools
2648,we are both very grateful to you your highness
2649,i am afraid not your highness
2650,he said he wished to speak to you himself
2651,you have your highness but the king spoke to me in confidence i must not steal his thunder hmm
2652,that shes going to get married of course not
2653,i have no desire to upset the king dear dear dear all this intrigue i knew it all this trouble here comes the king
2654,your majesty if you believe that
2655,what is the meaning of this
2656,you call yourself a nobleman sir yet it appears you enjoy bullying young girls hmm we are not the guilty ones here and dont look away when im talking to you you sir
2657,your majesty i didnt realise you were there sire
2658,may i ask you something sire if you knew it was the earl of leicester that gave your marriage plans away to your sister why didnt you accuse him have it out with him then and there
2659,but i have made an enemy of him sire
2660,i think i agree sire
2661,we shall leave at once sire
2662,there is something important sire if you are able to defeat saladin in this battle can you hold the city
2663,you will sire
2664,i am certain sire and when you look upon the city itself you will be able to find the answer to the problem of this war may we now take our leave sire
2665,as fast as our legs can carry us my dear
2666,only from afar he wont be able to capture it even now his armies are marching on a campaign that he can never win
2667,im afraid not my dear no history must take its course
2668,theyre between us and the ship
2669,yes they are i wonder what theyre up to
2670,no theres too many of them perhaps we can try no we cant do that
2671,now i know why weve been followed
2672,its that meddling fool leicester weve got to try and slip through them remember not a sound not a sound in you go
2673,take your hands off me sir what are you doing unhand me how dare you
2674,what is the meaning of this sir the king gave me leave to go
2675,gentlemen since i am to depart so punctiliously i would ask you to grant me one last wish
2676,thank you i would like to look once more upon the city of jaffa then you may do what you will with me
2677,thank you my lord
2678,what about that performance
2679,well my dear boy i must say i think youve earned a good knights sleep
2680,oh my dear young woman why dont you go have a cup of tea or something
2681,i dont know    the space museum ltback to the episode listing
2682,well i should hope so dear boy i should hope so
2683,well upon my soul yes yes now isn�t that extraordinary yes we were wearing those cloaks and things weren�t we well i must say it�s going to save us a lot of bother changing yes now lets see where we are shall we
2684,my dear boy it�s over and done with now lets forget it see where we are come along pay attention
2685,i expect child they�re hanging up where they�re supposed to be if you�re that much concerned go and have a look
2686,and on your way back bring me glass of water please i�m very parched
2687,oh dear dear dear now where were we all this fussation about a change of clothes you know its so simple it�s time and relativity my dear boy time and relativity that�s where the answer lies
2688,yes yes i know well at the moment there isn�t time now just pay attention will you  what�s this  vicki
2689,no i don�t think so my boy no no all those things up there come from a different period
2690,well i�m afraid i can�t give you any answers here my dear
2691,yes i don�t see why not after all the readings say it�s quite safe
2692,oh thank you my dear thank you so you dropped a glass did you
2693,well don�t look so concerned child it�s quite easily replaced
2694,oh yes yes yes we believe you child yes we believe you
2695,well look look you see where we�ve landed on a museum
2696,precisely if you take a closer look at those objects you�ll see that some of them are more advanced in design it�s quite a natural progression
2697,yes we shall find that out and i�m sure you will agree with me there are several things that we would like an answer to so i suggest we go outside and take a look for ourselves hmm
2698,well isn�t that extraordinary i�ve never seen erosion in such an advanced stage the whole planet appears to be completely dead
2699,nonexistent extinct
2700,well i must say the atmosphere�s quite pleasant
2701,yes i think we shall just have to go and search for the answers and as there�s always the element of danger in the unknown i suggest we keep closer together is that clear
2702,vicki
2703,good good now i�ll take the lead and lets try and find those buildings we saw on the scanner
2704,oh what is it now dear boy
2705,yes yes so it appears hmm
2706,yes that�s curious isn�t it yes very curious
2707,well we certainly haven�t met anyone yet
2708,how are we going to get in there
2709,my dear barbara if you�ve seen something or somebody there�s no sense in talking in riddles is there
2710,oh that�s quite enough now stop it youll have us all imagining things there must be an explanation of this little
2711,hide quickly
2712,up against the wall quick
2713,it�s extremely doubtful that they were both deaf however the fact is they didn�t hear now let�s see what�s in here
2714,no i think there�s probably something in the atmosphere that er has a very slow destructive property er hence the lack of windows
2715,oh i think that might just be some florescent substance in the walls yes well i think you two must admit that my assumption as to where we were has been proved correct
2716,well you just pretend there are young lady and keep your hands to yourself
2717,well why not why shouldn�t it be it�s quite natural after all you have objects of historical interest on earth so why not a museum in space i always thought i�d find one someday
2718,well i suppose the answers here somewhere that�s what we�ve got to find out let�s go and have a look in that other room
2719,don�t touch child
2720,i don�t mind admitting my boy that that thing gave me a start coming face to face to it again
2721,back get behind the case quick quick quick don�t touch it
2722,undoubtedly
2723,well i don�t know chesterton might have had the answer in what he just said but er i doubt it i doubt it come on come on
2724,child don�t make so much noise what�s the matter
2725,i thought i told you not to touch when are you going to learn to obey me how you
2726,upset upset whatever for why are you upset child what�s the matter
2727,incredible
2728,that�s strange strange indeed you know there must be a logical explanation for this somewhere you know i think it�s just a matter of putting two and two together to make three you know there is
2729,nothing absolutely nothing stand exactly where we are
2730,i�ve never known anything in my life in all my years of time travelling
2731,utterly unbelievable
2732,yes so strange and yet we have no communication with them
2733,does it my boy does it either that or we�re not really here
2734,i have no idea my child but until i say otherwise we continue the search now let us see what�s in here hmm
2735,good gracious me
2736,oh you�ve all decided have you
2737,are we we must have arrived here in the tardis sometime are we here look
2738,yes exhibits in a space museum
2739,so you know about it child we must have a little chat some time
2740,yes it does my boy and if we�re not there we can�t leave footprints and break glasses or touch things
2741,oh yes they can oh yes they can see us where we really are there
2742,well my dear i suppose we got into it there must be you know i don�t mind admitting i�ve always found it extremely difficult to solve the fourth dimension and here we are face to face with the fourth dimension you know i think the tardis jumped a time track and ended up here in this fourth dimension it�s extraordinary it�s inexplicable no wait a minute wait a minute i think you�re all going to be delighted i�m going to come up with the answer and it�s so simple yes so simple
2743,all we have to do is to wait here until we arrive
2744,you see my dear before they actually put us in those glass cases we must have arrived here sometime in the tardis these people saw us and thought we were worthy people to be put in their space museum then
2745,but nothing has happened to us yet what we are doing now is taking a glimpse into the future or what might be or could be the future all that leads up to it is still yet to come
2746,and end up one day my dear like that no we must not we�ve got to stop it happening
2747,i dont know my boy i can�t be certain you see i�m quite unable to measure the time dimension that the tardis jumped but you�ll notice we�re all wearing the same clothes so it could be in a few moments or a few seconds
2748,the cases will disappear and we shall all become visible
2749,precisely so you see we must succeed in stopping them making exhibits of us otherwise well there it is that�s how we�re all going to end up
2750,hmm
2751,yes my dear and we�ve arrived  episode two  the dimensions of time
2752,chesterton this is no time to be playing cowboys and indians
2753,is that so we have a very serious problem on our hands and what are you doing with this anyway put it back in there
2754,yes i think barbara�s quite right my dear if we walk out of here it could change the future perhaps if we wait until we�re taken out that might change the future the point is what are we going to do which is it to be
2755,it isn�t a good point at all my dear boy the fact is the future our future whether we leave here in the tardis or not
2756,yes it is
2757,decide my dear spinning a coin would be just as appropriate who would want to put us on show or display i wonder
2758,lost a button hmm that�s interesting yes that�s very interesting
2759,the least important things sometimes my dear boy lead to the greatest discoveries like steam for instance coming out of a kettle yes i was with him at the time let�s see now yes what was that fellows name
2760,yes you know losing a button could change the future it�s a pity my dear boy you didn�t discover it was missing in the cases when we were standing there staring at each other
2761,yes i quite understand that well i think we should leave the museum try and find the tardis and make sure that it doesn�t end up in here are you all agreeable
2762,come along then come along
2763,the way we came in of course
2764,your memory is like a sieve dear boy we turned right and then left
2765,i beg to differ you see you must turn right before you turn left
2766,we were facing from there down here therefore
2767,yes i suppose i must confess i am anyway i suggest we take vicki�s advice we can always retrace our steps so we go this way and turn right right
2768,yes i think vicki�s quite correct yes i have a distinct impression we�ve all been here before yes of course yes yes yes yes i know where we are now
2769,er er
2770,straight straight ahead my dear boy straight ahead yes and turn right
2771,no more talking please i think we�re nearly there
2772,hmm yes yes all right child
2773,i fooled them all i am the master
2774,curator of a museum is a better title
2775,really well from my observation it seems to arouse very little interest
2776,perhaps if you reduced the price of admission
2777,decline and fall of the roman empire oh yes it�s happened before yes in many galaxies far beyond your reach
2778,exploration
2779,i�m charmed
2780,why
2781,if you take a look into your screen perhaps you will find that out
2782,just some old friends of mine
2783,oh i�m not am i
2784,don�t blame your men i think my friends most probably left the area long before you put questions to me i imagined them still there of course because that was the last place i saw them so you see your little toy isn�t infallible is it
2785,ahh
2786,support me dear boy support me over there and sit me down
2787,i shall be all right in a minute it�s a bad attack of rheumatism yes it always happens to me when i�m cold
2788,yes unfortunately i�m not used to being subjected to such low temperatures
2789,it�s all right dear boy it�s not it�s not the circulation freeze
2790,yes don�t fuss now don�t do that
2791,my dear governor my dear lobos i don�t think your soldiers have really got their heart in their job have they thank you for getting me out of this little predicament although i would have been better pleased had you done it more voluntary
2792,yes i know i know
2793,dead not at all my boy not at all i was merely let me say frozen stiff
2794,exactly my brain was working with the speed of a mechanical computer i was asking myself questions and the answers were arriving with remarkable alacrity yes yes i must confess i didn�t enjoy the refrigeration hence this attack of rheumatism but thanks to you my dear boy i am now deiced and i think i�m quite capable of facing up to the climate once more
2795,the best thing for you governor lobos is to put you in there then you will have all the proof you needed but you think yourself lucky my conscience won�t allow me to do that it�s a pity isn�t it it�s a pity      ian
2796,yes and i�m not sure of that either chesterton have we have we or are we doing what we�re allegedly intended to do now what do you think
2797,that�s true but i�m sure the governor here would be delighted if we were both put back in there
2798,chesterton chesterton save your strength it�ll take much more than that to get us out of this situation
2799,well my boy you�d hardly call me a pessimist but i think it�s most unlikely that that is the only contraption of its kind
2800,yes i think i would have done the same thing
2801,yes and perhaps i shouldn�t have got myself captured
2802,yes vicki�s quite right quite right
2803,well it�s not necessarily my boy
2804,my dear barbara you must try and remember the short time we�ve been on this planet we�ve met people spoken to them and who knows we might have even influenced them
2805,yes i knew you were child yes yes i knew you were
2806,quite so yes quite so my boy
2807,the future doesn�t look too bad after all does it
2808,well there you both are that�s it that�s the little thing that�s been giving us all this dimensional trouble
2809,you know it�s a funny thing how it happened it got stuck i don�t know whether you�ve gone into a room and switched on the light and had to wait for a second or two before the thing lit itself up
2810,well this is the same kind of problem you see we landed on a separate time track wandered around a bit and until this little thing clicked itself into place we hadn�t actually arrived
2811,not at all my dear boy anytime anytime
2812,yes please yes i wonder if you�d mind taking it in for me inside the ship thank you i just want to fetch vicki
2813,there now
2814,yes i think i can quite understand your sentiments young man but you know you mustn�t lose sight of science altogether you might need it
2815,ah that my boy yes well that i got from the space museum this young man here tor very kindly gave it to me as a souvenir
2816,my dear chesterton i don�t think i have to ask your permission for what i take in my ship and another thing i will not have
2817,yes well as a matter of fact my dear it�s what they call a time and space visualiser you know i couldn�t believe my eyes when i saw it in the space museum and i have an idea i can get it working again
2818,you will see you will see all in good time now then have you said your goodbyes
2819,splendid splendid well now i think we must get moving goodbye young man
2820,goodbye tor come along my child come along
2821,dont whistle dear please
2822,stop whistling
2823,buzz off now
2824,out of the way out of the way
2825,deafen you no no dear boy it was an unfortunate juxtaposition of the sonic rectifier with the lineal amplifier
2826,ive already told you my dear its a time and space visualiser
2827,it converts neutrons of light energy into electrical impulses
2828,do i detect a hint of sarcasm dear boy
2829,very well then i shall quote you ven der haffs law mass is absorbed by light therefore light has mass and energy
2830,splendid child splendid
2831,i couldnt have put it better myself child
2832,yes thats exactly what this is
2833,i have already fixed it my dear my dear chesterton do you mind if i distract you from your cowboys and indians
2834,i want to give a little demonstration will you think of an event in history
2835,well first the place
2836,now the geographical location date and time
2837,good dont go away
2838,yes yes yes yes now all in good time my dear all in good time now barbara
2839,put it in there in the slot now    queen
2840,shh

2845,no no no no chesterton here here
2846,look here youd better take this tardis magnet with you watch that little green light in there dont drop it otherwise youll get lost
2847,yes yes yes
2848,i beg your pardon awful noise thats no way to talk about my singing
2849,oh yes yes it sounds like the visualiser i think its still on yes would you mind going in and switching it off for me dear
2850,yes thank you
2851,the daleks
2852,what is more important he referred to the tardis as the enemy time machine
2853,my machine can only pick up the things that happened in the past
2854,or worse already here you heard their orders we are to be exterminated
2855,yes yes yes yes but ian and the child come on we have such little time
2856,the wretched wind has wiped out all their tracks its so cold here
2857,ah this way dear
2858,i have the directional instincts of a homing pigeon now come along follow me
2859,its probably got buried in that sandstorm
2860,yes well wait a minute wait a minute ive got an idea lets have a look at the tardis magnet oh im sorry i just remembered i gave it to ian well come on come on we cant waste time lets get going that sunll be up in a minute and weve no food and theres no water no shade get down get down
2861,keep your head down they havent seen us yet
2862,stay down one of thems coming this way  we must find the tardis before they do
2863,yes warn them but how we havent seen them for hours anyway its no good hanging about here come on lets get moving come on
2864,these mire beasts what do they feed on
2865,you mean they attack humans
2866,oh good gracious
2867,oh i dont think they can travel far in this sand
2868,exploded
2869,now hush hush hush
2870,im afraid i cant see any signs of a city
2871,i see well were very grateful for your hospitality but i must you the daleks are right on top of us and i dont want either you or your people involved in any of this dangerous business if they knew youd given us shelter theyll show no mercy
2872,ah splendid splendid
2873,barbara barbara my dear come along come along come along     dalek 1
2874,oh my dear you think im being callous do you
2875,and i think its pure supposition that theyve been caught by those mire beasts after all we werent you havent much faith in ians infallible selfpreservation have you
2876,oh rubbish my dear rubbish i think its fascinating yes you could almost call it beautiful you know i think youre tired close your eyes and try and get some rest go on go on we must conserve our strength if were going to get back to the tardis  yes if ever we can get back to the tardis ah malsan
2877,oh indeed yes indeed yes yes it was a most unusual taste you know ive been taking stock of this place having a jolly good look round here tell me why is this opening walled up
2878,yes
2879,now what is it
2880,yes i suspected something of that kind might happen what is it
2881,they mean what they say they dont make idle threats have you replied
2882,you havent much choice have you well i dont propose to inflict our troubles on you sir so i think well leave and take our chances
2883,do you mean
2884,are you feeling better
2885,well its not too good im afraid ah this looks like bad news coming now
2886,well
2887,what is the news hmm
2888,they have no choice
2889,two hours their suns are due to set in two hours
2890,hmm
2891,oh its another part of the city i believe the part that was invaded
2892,is ian is chesterton all right
2893,ah well well well now that puts a different complexion on the matter tell me my dear this tunnel would you know how to find it again
2894,yes now i can
2895,barbara barbara
2896,chesterton come here
2897,my dear boy
2898,quickly quickly
2899,come along
2900,my dear boy were trying to beat the daleks not start a jumble sale
2901,dear dear dear dear dear
2902,what is the point of all this dear boy
2903,thats a good scheme yes thats a good idea
2904,mmm
2905,well i hope it works
2906,all right careful
2907,hey
2908,go on    dalek 4
2909,a momentary qualm a momentary qualm nothing more nothing more
2910,yes quite so
2911,oh i dont know i should think a little pate de dalek a la mire beast might be rather palatable
2912,well we can always drop you off to find out
2913,ah and i dont think we shall run into them again and i think you must agree that we gave them a very good hiding yes yes yes
2914,thats my time path detector its been in the ship ever since i constructed it but do you know i dont remember it registering before
2915,well it surveys the time path were travelling on the fact that its registering can only mean one thing
2916,its another time machine travelling on the same route     dalek 4
2917,oh its useless useless
2918,ah im afraid its no good im quite unable to elude them
2919,it takes twelve minutes for our computers to reorientate and gather power now that twelve minutes is vital to us we must hold onto it give me time to be able to do something whereby
2920,yes well please just leave it to me dear boy just leave it to me will you
2921,oh that means we can land in two minutes
2922,oh just the four of us young man
2923,yes quite so quite so dear boy well the computers will be ready in a few moments i suggest that we reembark
2924,vicki barbara come along
2925,no it aint i mean it isnt
2926,secret
2927,chase yes as a matter of fact young man thats exactly what this is now if youll excuse me i must be getting along its the chase you know
2928,catching us up are they will you get my screwdriver child the large one the one that i was fiddling with on the visualiser
2929,yes thank you thank you
2930,maybe im not sure but if theyre going to catch us up weve got to find something to fight back with
2931,thats out of the question my dear the vacuum in space we should all be dead in no time
2932,ah thank you thank you
2933,well the idea is my dear is to find something that we can fight back with
2934,but im not ready im not ready we cant meet them now oh good gracious no wait a minute we shall have to land and then take off as quickly as we can again
2935,well everything appears to be in order my boy
2936,indeed indeed well were ready to move on now would you tell the ladies that i want to get away please
2937,thank you
2938,ah im sorry about that too
2939,i altered the curve we were travelling on for one moment i dared hoped wed lost them they must have detected the change and followed theyre close on our track
2940,im afraid not its down to eight it will be reduced even further after our next landing we must face the facts the daleks are closing in on us  episode four  journey into terror
2941,oh rubbish my child vampire bats are only to be found in south america
2942,no i dont think so judging by the architecture i should say central europe
2943,yes in the normal progress of time my dear i would say i would agree with you but unfortunately weve got to face the daleks and i think its essential we take a look around lets try upstairs
2944,oh very well stay where you are we shant be long
2945,oh its just thunder dear boy
2946,oh rubbish there was no noise before that come along come along
2947,well it looks like a laboratory to me look at all that equipment down there
2948,oh nonsense weve only just left them dear boy now i must see whats on that table
2949,you dont mean that do you wheres your spirit of adventure
2950,very well then stay where you are stay where you are
2951,yes thats the word dear boy familiar you know when i was coming down those stairs i knew that thing was going to move i knew it
2952,i never stay where im not wanted come along
2953,this house is exactly what you would expect in a nightmare yes were in a world of dreams creaking doors thunder and lightning monsters and all the things that go bumpety bumpety in the night
2954,yes yes it exists in the dark recesses of the human minds millions of people secretly believing think of the immense power of all these people combined together makes this place become a reality
2955,safe what on earth do you mean dear boy
2956,you know i believe youre right yes the daleks can never land here
2957,had we
2958,well after you dear boy
2959,the tardis quick
2960,where have you both been
2961,game
2962,theory my dear boy fact i am convinced that that house was neither time nor space we were lodged for a period in an area of human thought
2963,oh i dont want to enter into it a discussion with him oh
2964,oh necessarily crude dear boy i havent time to perfect anything
2965,you know just as much about that as i do
2966,oh i quite agree with you running away wont solve our problem but as soon as weve reached the final decision to stand and fight therell be no turning back itll either be them or us hmm
2967,oh my dear very welcome
2968,thank you
2969,but i thought she was with you     dalek 2
2970,its my fault all my own stupid fault i shouldnt have moved the tardis i have should have checked up first to make sure that everybody was inside i shall never forgive myself
2971,you dont think id be standing here doing nothing do you if there were were helpless and you of all people should know that the tardis cant land in the same time and place twice
2972,yes of course its possible but it might take months even years
2973,yes my dear i know its worth a try but you dont think the daleks are going to sit back and allow us to tinker do you theyre right on our tracks their one aim is to destroy
2974,do you mean capture their machine
2975,if we can only pull it off
2976,i say yes yes yes our next landing will be our battle ground and we shall fight we shall fight to the death
2977,yes all to the good my boy this sort of terrain is going to make it very difficult for the daleks
2978,yes you are perfectly correct perfectly correct however it doesnt matter about the appearances its quite safe to go outside
2979,alive yes     dalek 1
2980,well im not sure young lady is it a plant or some kind of fungus
2981,yes i think this is the moment when discretion is the better part of valour lets get back into the ship
2982,well our friends here obviously dont like the light
2983,well it does suggest that there are other creatures on this planet yes creatures of intelligence
2984,yes
2985,yes its a kind of pattern yes youre quite right my boy a corridor
2986,yes yes well lets follow it this way     dalek 1
2987,we seem to have come to the end of our corridor of lights
2988,any daleks
2989,lets take a closer look
2990,well im not quite sure dear boy but there must be a reason for it yes like everything else in the universe there is a reason for it
2991,well i should imagine its some kind of weapon just hold that a minute
2992,very good my dear very good
2993,just just just shh shh shh just a moment now may i speak theres something i havent told you dear boy we cannot use this machine in an enclosed area otherwise we shall all go up in smoke
2994,that may be
2995,now youre talking common sense yes lets find the cable shall we
2996,youre quite safe its well insulated
2997,watch the machine watch the machine       dalek 2
2998,you know chesterton they have an extraordinary range of movement extraordinary
2999,take a look outside my boy ill look after vicki  ian
3000,robot my dear you have havent got a temperature have you
3001,a robot exactly like me
3002,so thats it this is very serious chesterton barbara would never have left here unless unless you or i told her to go
3003,you all right child come along
3004,robot robot me youre the imposter he is the imposter

3018,come along come along lets go come on
3019,well we must clear this cave as soon as possible otherwise we cant work that device
3020,they know now whos who give me that machine all of you get against the wall im going to see what i can do with this
3021,yes you got us out of a nasty situation there i supposed youd like to know who we are and why were here
3022,ifs fantastic
3023,yes well i dont like it
3024,yes yes robots but havent you noticed something very singular about this place
3025,weve only seen robots no animal life human or otherwise
3026,well weve learned something his name
3027,well im glad to know you steven taylor
3028,yes well you havent how long have you been here
3029,you mean theres no other human beings here on this planet
3030,no no no no theyre programmed to do their own repairs
3031,yes i see were being held here as specimens
3032,we make our way back to my spaceship
3033,i certainly hope so
3034,yes im coming dear boy im coming oh tell me young man what happens if these mechanoids see us up there
3035,good good
3036,splendid
3037,yes wait a minute dear boy
3038,oh its some power aerial i suppose
3039,yes yes if we can break it
3040,yes come along come along
3041,yes it sounds rather risky
3042,go on go on
3043,go on now i think well leave them something to remember us by            dalek 2
3044,never mind about that lets get on with this come along quickly get that come on
3045,come back         dalek 1
3046,vicki my child are you all right
3047,come along lets get back to the tardis
3048,we dont know my child and his chances of survival in this furnace are utterly
3049,my dear boy i could kiss you
3050,oh id be delighted you know this must be an extremely advanced machine wherever we went it followed us with such great precision and accuracy you could travel anywhere in it
3051,of course my dear id forgotten youve taken a trip in it
3052,my dear i shall be delighted
3053,aimless ive tried for two years to get you both home
3054,how dare you young man how dare you sir i didnt even invite you into the ship in the first place you both thrust yourselves upon me
3055,oh for heavens sake ive never heard such nonsense
3056,no no i will not aid and abet suicide
3057,dont you want to go with them child
3058,dont you realise child the enormous risks
3059,do you both realise the enormous risks
3060,very well follow me but you must follow my instructions implicitly understood implicitly you will both have about a fiftyfifty chance follow me come along
3061,i shall miss them yes i shall miss them silly old fusspots come along my dear its time we were off   next episode  the watcher ltback to the episode listing
3062,who
3063,yes i shall miss them too first susan and now them come over here my dear id like to talk to you
3064,oh thats all right my dear its already set their decision certainly surprised me although it shouldnt i know but it was quite obvious they intended to take the first opportunity of going back home
3065,its lucky for you child theyre not here to hear you say that good gracious me you think theyre old what do you think of me
3066,well perhaps vicki perhaps
3067,yes its done now although i must admit im left with a small worry
3068,my dear vicki im trying to talk to you
3069,i just wanted to ask you are you sure you didnt want to go home too i didnt give you very much time to consider now did i i should hate to think that youre just staying for the sake of an old man
3070,yes your father
3071,yes perhaps its something fallen down or maybe weve changed course
3072,now listen to me young man sit down now there are two things you can do one sit there until you get your breath back and two dont call me doc now do i make myself clear
3073,apart from that young man im quite willing to accept you at your face value
3074,oh does he now
3075,i dont see why i should my child hell learn soon enough
3076,that is the dematerialising control and that over yonder is the horizontal hold up there is the scanner those are the doors that is a chair with a panda on it sheer poetry dear boy now please stop bothering me
3077,vicki
3078,ive checked up on all the readings now i think our guest will need a wash and brush up so i think the best thing for you to do is go and find him some clothes and a cloak bring mine as well well show him whether this is a time machine or not
3079,well judging by the readings my child i think weve landed on the planet earth    ts hur from the stone age
3080,where did you say you found this vicki
3081,yes its a bit rusted but er its not as old as that tenth eleventh century england well there you are young man what do you think of that now eh a viking helmet
3082,what do you mean maybe what do you think it is a space helmet for a cow
3083,oh rubbish rubbish
3084,oh i see so youve changed your ideas now
3085,yes yes yes but unfortunately we have a slight technical hitch at the moment excuse me
3086,yes perhaps we should find a village whereby we can convince this young upstart of the true facts
3087,oh yes what is it now
3088,the design is completely immaterial young man the tardis is required to land and blend in with its surroundings
3089,yes quite so for instance if we were to land in the middle of the indian mutiny well im sure the ship could possibly take on the appearance of a howdah
3090,a howdah a carrier on the back of an elephant
3091,yes yes yes yes but you do keep on dont you
3092,now i suggest we take a walk along the beach and try and find a spot where the cliffs run down to sea level
3093,yes so possibly it might but im not a mountain goat and i prefer walking to it any day and i hate climbing
3094,no you wont youll stay with the ship and wait til ive got to the top then you can both climb up and join me
3095,im not going to argue my child
3096,oh whats this
3097,mead oh mead yes of course yes yes how nice of you yes delightful thank you thank you well heres to your very good health
3098,oh yes yes yes yes yes quite understandable you know sounds do play funny tricks at times
3099,well thats very kind very kind indeed and i do hope they wont worry about me too much you know i hadnt intended to walk quite so far you are near the coast
3100,yes yes
3101,oh of course of course my dear the vikings for example
3102,yes i had heard about that battle yes yes the king er greatly improved the position no end
3103,you know it seems like yesterday that the good king edward was laid to rest when was it
3104,oh of course yes yes yes the beginning of the year yes yes yes how silly yes its most refreshing
3105,oh thank you yes thank you my dear
3106,oh nothing nothing i just that i wasnt sure whether id crossed the border or not yes its a bit tedious of me isnt it but you must have patience with an old man
3107,i will i will and thank you indeed thank you yes its a great pity that barbara isnt here now if my memory of english history serves me right were about to have a viking invasion and very soon now let me think harold came north to defeat hardrada the norwegian king yes now that was before he faced william the conqueror at hastings its all very interesting yes thats very very very very interesting its going to put that young man in his place
3108,the monastery where is it did you say
3109,the monks have they been here long
3110,and you havent seen them no one in the village has
3111,oh youve been very kind and a great help yes im sorry but i must take my leave of you
3112,i most certainly am
3113,well from what youve just said youve saved me quite a journey
3114,yes indeed so i told them quite specifically to meet me outside the tar the prearranged place i was going along to tell them that id come to no harm whilst i was making investigations as we might say but well now now you tell me they came here and theyve gone on to the monastery
3115,oh its all perfectly simple i left through the rear entrance that reminds me i really think i ought to be wending my way its a good thing i saw the smoke rising from your fire im becoming quite a regular visitor i think
3116,youve seen them and their fleet
3117,yes i see yes i see
3118,what what was that ive already told you my dear that ive learned of varied plans from all the places that ive visited before
3119,yes yes im afraid so
3120,the monk in this situation just cant be a coincidence
3121,yes i must face him i realise that ive got far short a time than i thought i had im always leaving you in a hurry im afraid but the matter has some urgency
3122,oh no thank you thank you indeed its very kind of you i must go yes goodbye oh and dont worry dont worry the vikings will land south of here in the humber and king harold will defeat them yes and then in a few weeks time he loses the battle of hastings to william the conqueror well at least thats what the history books said happened
3123,i have a winchester 73 right in the middle of your spinal cord
3124,oh did you now well as it happens i happen to be a very curious fellow yes very curious now then i have some questions for you and i want them answered continue
3125,all right that will do you know i believe weve come through this corridor twice already its no use you playing for time you know i want some answers
3126,never mind about all that what is it youre doing here what are you up to
3127,just leave that shall we
3128,then well both go ill open the door then i can keep an eye on you
3129,oh isnt it why not
3130,oh yes i see i see first you want to open the door then you want the chance to reverse the position with the help of whoever it is outside secondly you want to get me into a monks habit so that whoever that is would recognise me as an imposter
3131,yes and you can drop the monks act
3132,yes very well if you have another cloak with the same type of cowl proceed
3133,and remember no more monkery
3134,what is the meaning of this sir what
3135,what
3136,my dear man you had me quite worried i thought you were never coming in
3137,there you are my dear fellow i knew youd come back now which fires what are they for
3138,i repeat my question which fires and what are they for
3139,i see
3140,well out with it
3141,so thats it youre a time meddler no wonder you wanted to get rid of me and what are you trying to get up to this time
3142,are you quite mad you know as well as i do the golden rule about space and time travelling never never interfere with the course of history
3143,is that so
3144,and what mischief are you up to now
3145,oh is that so
3146,by wiping out the viking fleet
3147,so you plan to save him the journey
3148,oh yes its quite a plan its quite a plan yes i count myself a very fortunate person indeed to be here in time to prevent this disgusting exhibition
3149,havent i where is this machine
3150,where is it
3151,oh so thats it eh this horrible block of stone
3152,a saxon what
3153,yes quite so
3154,now now now dont try and bamboozle me it so happens that your machine fits into this monastery but its sheer luck
3155,i see and all this is part of your master plan
3156,oh isnt there now well lets have a look at this great wonder yes well tell me how does one exactly get into this sarcophagus hammer and chisel
3157,thats a very good point my child indeed a very good point i must ask him that myself
3158,safe
3159,safe oh my dear of course im safe good gracious me i see you found the machine keep your eye on that young man i thought id told you to wait outside the tardis
3160,you know all this is very surprising thats a mark 4
3161,hmm
3162,oh forgot forgot what child
3163,hmm
3164,havent we now oh i say well i wonder what thats supposed to mean
3165,yes i remember very well yes it so happens that i was there at the time my dear i may appear a little half witted at times but
3166,oh
3167,oh is that all my child
3168,the water cannot affect the tardis it wont wash away itll still be there when the tide goes down now stop fretting my dear well i must confess er i do congratulate you its a splendid machine although i do note theres been quite a few changes
3169,oh i see yes of course and er thereby you can suspend yourself in space with absolute safety
3170,mind your own business
3171,yes i regret that we do but i would say that i am fifty years earlier now when are you going to answer my questions
3172,the reason for this deliberate destruction
3173,improve things improve things yes thats good very good improve what for instance
3174,hed do what
3175,oh yes quite so yes of course i do know the medium
3176,what are we going to do with this fellow what can we do with this man hes utterly irresponsible he wants to destroy the whole pattern of world history
3177,oh quick quick
3178,wide awake my dear as a matter of fact i was just turning over in my mind what were going to do with this monk fellow he wont listen hes determined to have his own way hes got to be stopped he must be stopped
3179,oh yes thank you thank you indeed oh its a good thing for us that you decided to make a search
3180,ah yes the monk now was he caught
3181,yes yes no doubt theyll catch up with him and the rest of them but that monk you know still worries me i think hes got some tricks left up his sleeve
3182,oh we shall continue with our travels
3183,oh yes certainly certainly but we have one or two things to do here at the monastery first but we dont want to delay you well follow on
3184,you know we cant do that my child not until we stop this time meddler have either of you got a pencil and paper on you
3185,well now be a good fellow and go into the machine and try and find one
3186,hmm
3187,to the monk of course who else
3188,oh mr taylor where are you with that string dear boy
3189,good gracious me come along
3190,now keep your nose out my child never mind did you hear what i said keep your nose away do you want to get a shock this is a very dangerous business now keep still all of you tie this in a knot
3191,dont please ask me questions go child outside
3192,now back elbow room please now keep still were not out of the wood yet
3193,hasnt it hasnt it my dear boy
3194,yes sometime my dear sometime here put that in your pocket quite safe
3195,yes and
3196,keep your hands off it young lady i dont want you nosing into peoples personal and private correspondence gracious me well i think weve finished here now lets go
3197,yes certainly back to the tardis yes come along
3198,oh glad indeed well we must start climbing down the cliff and get aboard as soon as we can theres going to be an invasion shortly
3199,yes my boy yes and history will be
3200,yes and both very welcome ones my dear come along come along come on come on
3201,we have my dear
3202,well we should know about that when we have a look at the scanner shant we now you can both take a look
3203,quiet both of you will you listen listen
3204,exactly exactly there isnt a sound out there not a sound just silence
3205,yes i dont see why not my child it appears absolutely deserted as a matter of fact i think we shall get some longdeserved undisturbed peace for once
3206,my dear young man this isnt a joy ride this is a scientific expedition
3207,from past experience we must always be on our guard
3208,shh shh
3209,yes like something trying to discover by touch something blind
3210,yes it is blind
3211,as you say my dear whatever it is
3212,yes yes it might be that to its controller whoever it might be
3213,its gone now
3214,you know i must be wrong child there is life out there yes a very intelligent highly intelligent life to build machines like that
3215,well chumbley if you like my child
3216,im going to find out come along my child and bring my stick
3217,oh indeed how delightful well theres one thing child theres no chumblies about
3218,this silence reminds of the planet xeros
3219,no no my dear not again not again but its so quiet
3220,stand still otherwise we all might be killed we come in peace we dont wish you any harm
3221,no but by the look of that thing sticking out in front its unmistakably like a speaker to me
3222,you dumb fool
3223,oh indeed that was very noble of you indeed now youve put the thing on its guard yes its interesting its fascinating did you notice that it didnt do anything until you made a noise
3224,oh yes and very accurately you know i believe it can locate us by some form of heat wave as it were
3225,stand still dont let it move you
3226,well its some kind of light ray very powerful and dangerous i would say i think were better do what the thing wants
3227,whats that
3228,what might the drahvins be  drahvin 1
3229,why cant you tell us  drahvin 1
3230,the rills are these the people that control these things  drahvin 2
3231,oh i should like to meet these rills
3232,its only what they say and who are they
3233,yes all right well perhaps youd better take us to this maaga this leader whatever it is
3234,theyre all magnetised so that you cant get the top off
3235,goodness gracious
3236,come come
3237,quickly quickly
3238,yes i think so its all this physical exercise at my age  drahvin 2
3239,its pretty backward now isnt it yes its almost fossilised
3240,are we safe here  drahvin 1
3241,yes madam the young lady speaks the truth the chumblies are magnetised
3242,yes thank you i will
3243,oh naturally
3244,i see
3245,oh as bad as that
3246,oh come now theres no need to exaggerate
3247,disintegrates this planet
3248,when
3249,well that sounds reasonable enough to me
3250,yes feminine ah female
3251,yours must be a very interesting civilisation you attacked the rills
3252,well thats no description no description at all
3253,yes i think im beginning to understand
3254,switch off the outside radio why i wonder
3255,yes yes madam you may not but id like to hear it
3256,ah i see its stopped
3257,you didnt do it very much damage did you
3258,and you havent destroyed one chumbley yet
3259,you know i think you rather underestimate the rills why should they tell you that this planet is going to die
3260,on the other hand it might have been a pack of lies
3261,well this planet could last another million years
3262,i have im a scientist
3263,oh thank you thank you well im afraid we shall have to go back to my ship
3264,oh but why
3265,oh you worry too much
3266,but my dear
3267,yes well very well young man you and i will go
3268,well theyd have to be pretty well advanced to break my force barrier
3269,hmm    vicki has been left on her own in the drahvin living quarters shes troubled unable to quell the nagging suspicion that maaga is hiding something hearing raised voices in the next compartment vicki crosses to the bulkhead and presses her ear against it
3270,there you see my boy look not a scratch not a scratch
3271,i certainly excelled myself with that force barrier
3272,oh now wait a minute i think theyve all gone to bed well its a very good thing i brought you around young man to tell me what im supposed to be doing
3273,the rills were quite right
3274,yes if the drahvins let us go
3275,they need our help with the rills why do you think theyve held vicki back
3276,its imperative that we leave at once
3277,two dawns tomorrow is the last day this planet will ever see   episode two  trap of steel
3278,i wish i knew
3279,no no its waiting for something
3280,i cant quite see
3281,oh thank you oh oh i think guy fawkes must have been resurrected
3282,yes well are you all right dear boy
3283,no no no no no no no itd take more than that to get in here
3284,yes well its going to be disappointed isnt it look you see there they go look away into the distance emptyhanded
3285,yes yes unless they come back with a piece more trouble i wonder come on we must go so little time
3286,two dawns come on come on
3287,are you talking to yourself dear boy
3288,yes yes i dont think much of it its not very well advanced is it in fact as you say its oldfashioned yes i dont think these drahvins are very intelligent do you
3289,yes well its tough but its not impregnable no its very common metal really yes its its nothing unusual nothing unusual well i suggest that we go in instead of standing around here admiring the scenery come along
3290,but you brought up the subject now dont argue please dont argue ive never heard such rubbish
3291,yes yes yes yes
3292,yes my child im all right
3293,they tried to blow us up inside the tardis
3294,well of course they didnt my ships not made of tin like this old trash oh good gracious me seems if i cough too loudly the whole thingd fall to pieces
3295,ah yes whatever that might be
3296,hmm
3297,yes
3298,im afraid so
3299,exactly when the rills said it would in fourteen dawns time
3300,hmm
3301,to do what exactly
3302,and how do i do that what happens then
3303,well i mean what happens to the rills
3304,we only have your word for that in any case i cant help you
3305,in the first place madam i never kill anything neither do my friends
3306,or as the young man suggests why dont you both go off together
3307,yes a very good question dear boy
3308,yes all these objections sum up mine its none of our business its impossible im afraid we cant help you and it does appear to me that none of you have tried to help yourselves
3309,no
3310,very likely
3311,two dawns
3312,it may not be ready yet
3313,oh you have great faith in me havent you
3314,you will do as the young man suggests
3315,come along vicki we have very little time madam do i begin by walking through this
3316,oh i was just ruminating about the night and day i was wondering when it was going to get dark then i just realised that theres three suns on this planet
3317,oh yes they must my dear they must otherwise this maaga woman wouldnt be talking about dawns probably lasts about two hours
3318,you remember when we were captured by those chumblies
3319,that ray gun why did they use it on the ship i mean if the rills are such enemies of the drahvins why dont they just wipe them out
3320,oh dont you believe that my dear dont you believe that for one minute no that ray gun could go through this like a piece of paper
3321,no its all very odd isnt it yes its very odd
3322,oh yes of course nearly one dawn yes we must start that journey are you nervous
3323,fascinating things to watch ay i wonder what the principal of the operation is i suppose its quite simple once you know
3324,hmm
3325,ah yes yes thats quite a problem my child isnt it
3326,well now dont lose patience you see now look in this case first we must observe note collate and then conclude after that perhaps we can act
3327,shh shh shh quiet quiet
3328,what are you doing
3329,are you trying to get us killed
3330,yes yes yes you may appear to be right but its dangerous and its very risky
3331,oh yes yes yes quite so yes yes you about finished this time ill give you the benefit of the doubt but well now i suppose weve got to make a run for it
3332,i think i can drag my aged limbs in some sort of semblance of a run go on
3333,look that looks like the home of the rills
3334,yes and whats that other thing
3335,yes it does doesnt it what could they be drilling for
3336,yeah well theres only one way to find out go on
3337,wed be in trouble you know this is a nice piece of building
3338,its most impressive yes most impressive and whats this i wonder you know i think these rills are far more advanced than i thought they were
3339,yes or some kind of machinery for converting air into something else yes its most interesting can you see anything
3340,ill lead the way
3341,hmm
3342,can you smell anything
3343,what is it
3344,yes so should i come on
3345,that what
3346,whats it doing listening or smelling come on come on
3347,hmm
3348,not awake just yet
3349,i cant move it its immovable wait wait wait i have an idea i might be able to sabotage them be patient we know what this machines for this is to convert air into ammonia gas
3350,yes well have patience child when ive finished with this machine im sure they will release you
3351,no no thats the last thing we do this is the thing that gives them the gas to breathe with
3352,my dear child the rills cant go outside its a foregone conclusion
3353,well i think you youd better do what they want
3354,yes that was one of the rills i suppose
3355,look you go with them quickly but dont cause any trouble itll give me time to see if i can help you i think perhaps i can do something to that machine but i must have time yes
3356,all right dont worry goodbye        drahvin 2
3357,oh child
3358,are you sure youre all right child
3359,is that a rill talking
3360,oh yes you were told correctly
3361,oh im sorry i beg your pardon i thought you couldnt hear
3362,ah yes it does occurs to me that if we do that we might be trapped
3363,well yes indeed of course child yes thats quite true quite true yes well lead the way lead the way as it happens id like to take a look round whats this whats this fellow doing
3364,ah yes quite so
3365,oh why ever not
3366,oh what nonsense were not children you know
3367,oh very well carry on carry on oh what utter rubbish isnt it
3368,very well if you take my advice youll get a move on theres very little time left
3369,oh yes we know more than you your timing is wrong the disintegration of this planet is not fourteen dawns away it is now less than two dawns
3370,two dawns
3371,i think i might be able to supply you with the power you need yes i think ill help you since youre so willing to help us
3372,first i will need some metalcored cable
3373,splendid splendid i think i can put into effect the transference of power from my ship to this now first of all i must have a conversion now is that possible

3434,whats the matter child
3435,oh yes im afraid we shall yes well just have to put a cold compress on that oh dear dear dear you know i wish we could stop somewhere for a while and take stock of ourselves instead of being surrounded by dangers all the time just put that third switch forward would you thank you
3436,yes yes i wonder
3437,oh im not sure my child youll notice theyre wearing grecian costumes
3438,i havent the remotest idea my boy no doubt their reasons will be entirely adequate yes i think i perhaps id better go and ask them where we are
3439,oh what nonsense if you take notice of them i think theyre doing more talking than they are fighting i think id better go and ask them where we are
3440,now you stay here my dear and look after that ankle
3441,not at all young man you stay here and keep an eye on vicki besides i dont think your present humour is fitting for the occasion you know i dont think theyd appreciate your kind of sarcasm
3442,stop you must not kick a man when he is down you have killed this poor fellow
3443,in my name indeed get up get up i tell you this is terrible
3444,what is this what is it you take me for
3445,what do you really and who might you be may i ask
3446,well if i may say so youre not very humble are you yes i think i know you yes and this friend of yours must be
3447,blasphemy im sure he didnt mean it
3448,oh did he now well if you notice i have no beard
3449,oh do i
3450,i beg your pardon i do nothing of the kind
3451,oh indeed indeed so yes so i should hope yes well thank you im glad to meet you now if you will excuse me i must get back to my temple attend to his funeral
3452,do you realise whom you are addressing
3453,then do not hinder me or i will strike you with a thunderbolt
3454,well i dont see why i should i have many other commitments you must understand
3455,certainly not
3456,i wouldnt stand for that if i were you
3457,oh yes its true
3458,oh yes i find it most interesting
3459,this is my travelling temple being small its convenient
3460,certainly not in any case i must be off
3461,no i er
3462,i am quite capable of walking
3463,i refuse to enter into any kind of vulgar bawdry
3464,have a care do not touch me
3465,you may rise i am most displeased who is in command here
3466,as i have always understood yet this mountebank odysseus appears to be a law unto himself he makes fun of his guests and laughs at zeus
3467,if i am not a god how do you account for my supernatural knowledge
3468,i could tell you one or two things that might surprise you
3469,your wife for instance is unfaithful to you
3470,then treat me with honour and return me to my temple before i really become angry
3471,if i were an enemy what could one man do alone and unarmed against the glory that is greece hmm
3472,no no achilles leave him why try to kill him now when you are in sight of victory
3473,i could almost guarantee it
3474,but first i would like to know am i to be treated as a god or as an enemy if you kill me now it will probably cost you the war
3475,arrest but i must return to my tar er my temple
3476,very well
3477,only for what he seems to be
3478,quite so
3479,i do not know and i do not care
3480,i think it would be much safer on the whole stop have you lost your senses
3481,do not mock me my lord odysseus would you stain the tent of agamemnons with a trojans blood i claim this man as a sacrifice to olympus bring him to my temple in the plain at sunrise in the morning and i will show you a miracle
3482,i will strike him with a bolt from heaven
3483,yes i did
3484,disappeared
3485,well it should be about here somewhere rather hard to understand these sandy plains are so much alike
3486,this sacrifice can only be performed within the temple
3487,do not labour this point i am not zeus and this young man is a friend of mine neither of us are trojans sir
3488,of course she couldnt i told you last night
3489,i think you had better tell him
3490,well i would hardly call it a miscalculation my boy
3491,well i think with all eternity to choose from i did rather well to get us back to earth
3492,no they didnt
3493,yes yes i dare say i suppose some kind of ritual death i presume
3494,and what are those conditions may i ask
3495,two days that isnt very long is it
3496,oh my dear boy i couldnt possibly suggest that the whole story is obviously absurd probably invented by homer as some good dramatic device no i think it would be completely impractical
3497,oh patience my
3498,yes well i have thought up of some conditions of my own
3499,well its all very simple that is if you want me to help you sack the city you must promise me that vicki will be spared
3500,well were not quite sure of that are we
3501,my dear boy are you quite sure
3502,i sincerely hope not have you thought of tunnelling
3503,ah yes dear me sear me well tell me have you thought about flying machines
3504,considerable here now you just take that for a moment now pay attention please
3505,well what does it look like a flying machine
3506,excellent since youre so familiar with this project then its so much easier for me to talk to you come along come along
3507,now of course you realise that we can build a much larger one capable of carrying a man
3508,oh think my dear odysseus a whole fleet of them carrying a company of soldiers over the walls and into troy
3509,catapults
3510,nonsense the catapult is well you could make one for yourself out of strips of ox hide and secure both ends and then stretch it out like a bowstring
3511,then you pour water over it let it dry in the sun and what happens then
3512,never mind that it shrinks now allow me to demonstrate you place the flying machine thus as you would an arrow in a bow and let it go
3513,the machine flies in the air with a soldier clinging to its back
3514,agamemnon then
3515,thank you i thought youd like it
3516,oh why not
3517,well anyone could do it for that matter i mean even a child could operate it
3518,excellent excellent
3519,im thinking
3520,dismiss them then
3521,oh im quite well aware of that but im afraid this machine isnt going to work
3522,no no no it isnt that not at all ive made a mistake in my calculations
3523,yes yes im afraid we must face up to it odysseus man was never meant to fly
3524,oh what do you mean
3525,ah but i have another idea and a much better one
3526,have you ever thought of a horse
3527,it should be a huge horse about forty feet high
3528,we build it hollow and we fill it with soldiers and leave it on the sandy plain for the trojans to capture it
3529,and the greeks pretend to sail away
3530,well its all perfectly simple
3531,we build it of wood and we build it hollow then we fill it with a picked team of soldiers
3532,you take to the ships and sail away to make the trojans think youve all gone
3533,you all come back again of course
3534,none of this must happen before nightfall
3535,that wasnt part of the plan
3536,that will not be necessary i shall only get in the way
3537,then they drag the horse into the city
3538,oh well that is a calculated risk but somehow i dont believe theyll want to destroy one of their own gods
3539,yes i only wish i shared your confidence
3540,no no odysseus it isnt that but i just didnt like the look of those fetlocks theyve no safety margin at all
3541,ah suppose it collapses whilst were all in it
3542,yes and ive no wish to be made a laughing stock
3543,odysseus come here quickly
3544,ive never felt less like sleep in my life i thought i saw some movement down there
3545,i think i ought to warn you that ive given second thoughts to the whole of this scheme and i think it better we turn round and go back before its too late get out of my way
3546,well but
3547,oh
3548,im still very worried about those fetlocks
3549,if only you would have allowed me another day to fit shock absorbers oh i say oh
3550,oh well now what is it you propose to do
3551,how you can sit there so peacefully defeats me have you no feelings no emotions
3552,you mean theyll desert us
3553,that is a most immoral way of looking at life
3554,yes well i must get out of here at once
3555,ive only got to pull that lever and i can get back down into the square
3556,i will not be party to your schemes you forced me to invent this contraption
3557,you had no right to bring me here at all im utterly useless to you you must let me out of here youre selfish greedy corrupt cheap horrible your one thought is for yourself and what you can get out of it
3558,i will not be quiet you may stay here if you wish to have your insignificant win your victory or whatever you call it but you must let me out of here
3559,oh my dear child oh how lovely to see you where have you been all this time and wheres steven
3560,oh now one thing at a time child wheres the young man
3561,but who is this child now pull yourself together weve got to go

3580,my dear child youre not dead thats nonsense
3581,well as you wish
3582,yes yes yes as you wish my child now i want you to keep an eye on that young man will you

3585,im doing the very best i can my child oh dear dear dear it is such a worry this poison seems to be spreading throughout the whole of his system yes we need a special drug i shall have to land somewhere
3586,oh were slowing down my dear were going to land in a moment
3587,ah well i rather doubt it at least that is we shall be stopping at a lot of places before that now i want you to look after steven if you will and see that you keep that wound clean please thats a good girl
3588,i dont know my dear but i must try now i want you to stay here and look after steven i shall be as quick as i can
3589,splendid now you know which switch to pull to close the doors dont you so i want you to do that straight away i have my key to let myself in
3590,yes this child key this opens the door from the outside now go in please and shut the door charming    with katarina safely back inside the tardis the doctor sets off into the jungle once hes gone bret comes out of hiding and examines the tardis doors after a moment he turns and hurries after the doctor    before long the doctor catches sight of lights up ahead moving closer he sees a cluster of buildings in a wide valley surrounded by dense jungle i
3591,what is it you want
3592,what key
3593,so youd use physical violence would you you dont know what youve let yourself in for so youve left the key in the door well well thats the first big mistake isnt it yes very foolish very foolish indeed young man well now its brain or brawn rather versus brain ive got you beaten from the start young man
3594,i wonder if that spaceship has anything to do with that violent young man or any connection with that city below yes there are one or two questions i must have answered      dalek 2
3595,i doubt that youll be able to get out of there in a hurry my friend
3596,oh its a little invention of mine i call it the magnetic chair it has a forcefield strong enough to restrain a herd of elephants so i wouldnt waste your energy trying to escape you will stay there until i direct otherwise
3597,yes oh by the way ive found a city and just as i was about to ascertain its locale that young ruffian set about me
3598,oh yes i hope so just a minute that young man did he say anything
3599,thats strange yes i shall have to crossexamine him when i get back but dont worry hes quite safe our guest is quite unable to move until i press that little switch at the back so youre quite safe yes hes quite harmless oh and quite comfortable i hope
3600,daleks
3601,katarina
3602,doctor doctor what are you both doing here
3603,yes well whoever this bret is hes quite right the daleks are evil things
3604,what that young ruffian
3605,and you released him
3606,girl my tardis child my tardis yes you were right i mean he wasnt to know that you were quite safe away from the daleks in there how is this young man
3607,good good good
3608,i see i see yes and i clamped him in that chair and hes the very fellow with the antitoxin well young man youd better pull yourself together weve got some work to do    dalek 1
3609,carefully carefully now just rest for a minute take a few deep breaths dont you try to run before you can walk although you might have to oh its bret isnt it yes thank you tell me whats happening
3610,good gracious me we must try to get back to the tardis were in grave danger here
3611,yes yes yes possibly possibly
3612,i never do and never shall
3613,yes youre quite right my dear its the safest place
3614,oh not necessarily not
3615,well in this instance child he might be but i know the daleks
3616,they could track us down at any time
3617,oh they were robots
3618,these are daleks now you listen to me young man i am in charge of this situation
3619,well upon my soul
3620,yes and you will have to do far more than that if the daleks are doing something drastic then we have to stop the daleks now will you shut up sir
3621,we know young man
3622,now just listen listen listen think back for a moment just think back if the daleks were going to attack earth as you seem to fear then you must tell earth to look back in the history of the year 2157 and that the daleks are going to attack again history will show how to deal with them
3623,now listen
3624,yes yes youre quite right young man theyre going to trap us
3625,oh no no no not quite not quite my dear weve got to get out of here come on this way
3626,but of course thats the last place they will expect us to go come along
3627,you know that spaceship
3628,oh then youll know how to fly it
3629,well thats the one to go for isnt it
3630,will you both be quiet please were going to take that spaceship if were going to warn earth
3631,well obvious or not my boy its quite obvious hes one of the representatives
3632,no no not yet not yet not until we find out exactly what the daleks are planning and this may be our only chance
3633,im going to that conference
3634,why not if i wear his cloak why not
3635,oh nonsense you three can take over the spaceship and i can join you later
3636,oh yes now dont worry my child dont worry
3637,oh in the jungle now i want you i want you to give me enough time to get to that meeting and find out exactly whats going on then i will head back to chens spaceship
3638,well i must leave that to your own judgment if of course you hear any kind of uproar well then youll have to get into the spaceship and go off without me
3639,oh nonsense nonsense earth must be warned about the daleks and about chen
3640,rubbish rubbish my boy im only doing what has to be done now come on help me on with this cloak be quick about it come along      dalek 1
3641,get us off bret get us off get us off take off man
3642,that was rather violent acceleration young man      dalek 1
3643,well done bret well done you got us off very well
3644,of course i was youre far too pessimistic now wheres that little box of mine
3645,yes ah splendid splendid the daleks plans are utterly useless without this
3646,theyve allied themselves with the rulers of the outer galaxies to take over the universe
3647,yes their first objective being earth and then the solar system
3648,oh hes one of them my friend by sacrificing the solar system he hopes to gain more power
3649,oh no it isnt no it isnt therefore we must get to earth before him
3650,yes i know my dear but this is not earth as we see it effectively its something very different
3651,well as i said before my boy the daleks plans are utterly useless without this
3652,tut tut tut dont open it please
3653,it will burn your eyes youll go totally blind that is a full emm of taranium
3654,taranium
3655,fifty years to be precise and mavic chen has given this to the daleks to complete one of the most evil weapons ever devised their time destructor
3656,yes the rarest mineral in the universe
3657,oh dont complain young man youre a very privileged person do you realise very few people have seen this in this universe
3658,well for the moment nothing
3659,we have the taranium so for the moment we do nothing and by doing nothing we do everything do i make myself clear
3660,oh my dear young man you ask so many questions look at katarina over there she doesnt ask questions she just looks and learns now why dont you try the same thing you know i find all this extremely fascinating its a little primitive of course but its still very fascinating
3661,yes bret can you find me something to play magnetic tape
3662,well my dear fellow thats magnificent its all so convenient isnt it ill play that tape that i gave you before i went to the daleks conference
3663,oh i found a small tape beside a skeleton and it might be able to tell us something katarina come over here my child now have a look at another wonder
3664,no my dear no
3665,no no no bret here was searching for someone and the skeleton i found was humanoid well whoever it was may learned something that we havent
3666,well did you search that pairing twice
3667,well it so happens that kind of jungle is apt to lead you back to the same place more than once
3668,oh yes no doubt you were and i suppose i was lucky now play the tape come along come along stop all this talking  cory
3669,but we must the daleks will stop at anything to prevent us
3670,yes yes you must find someone who you can trust someone in a high enough position that may be able to help
3671,were changing course
3672,you know i believe were approaching the gravitation point of that planet
3673,has it any kind of atmosphere
3674,well if its one of your prison planets surely there are guards and warders there to help us
3675,you must try to land softly somewhere
3676,yes im afraid i do only too well
3677,youre quite right my boy
3678,yes it means that they coming after us again
3679,its the worse of these outofdate and primitive spaceships one little bump and they all fall to bits
3680,oh yes quite so thats why we are stranded on this pimple of a planet whilst you footle with that fuse box
3681,now you listen to me young man dont you start to criticise my tardis and as for space travel youre still wet behind the ears oh do get on with it both of you
3682,what are you doing out here child i thought i told you to keep these doors closed
3683,good gracious so there are two no three yes we must get on with the repairs to the ship and get away from here yes those men will be vicious out there were liable to come under attack thats marshy ground very interesting very interesting interesting
3684,oh thank you my dear where is your cactic power rather outlet
3685,cactic outlet
3686,where
3687,oh yes thank you thank you thank you come here my dear no round this way child now do you see that switch ill tell you when to pull it
3688,oh dont ask questions my dear girl otherwise youll become like the other two just do as youre told
3689,yes i think youre right my dear now you go in and stand by that switch wait until ill give you an order
3690,oh you two go back in there and get on with your repairs katarina and i are trying to repel any type of boarders
3691,but of course not but it will knock them unconscious now just you remember young man i have no desire to kill anyone now go in there and get on with those repairs i want to leave this place quickly hurry up please wasting my time well i think that should do the trick my dear come along lets get this cable back there we are
3692,i hope so my dear i hope so
3693,get off get off get off
3694,oh im so sorry im not used to this kind of craft
3695,look look the daleks ship made a bad landing that gives us the time we need
3696,oh im so glad to hear that young man now you got some thinking to do katarina check up on that door and see that it is secure
3697,remember chen will have allies on earth and
3698,who are you what do you want release that girl
3699,kembel
3700,the daleks are no help were going back to earth
3701,were changing course now release that girl
3702,the girl will be dead before the doors half open can we talk to him in there
3703,lets try a little bluff now then listen to me whoever you are bring that girl in here or we will press a button and you will go outside the door into space
3704,weve got to get katarina out of there
3705,change course
3706,take him back to kembel take him back to kembel let the daleks deal with him
3707,dont worry dear boy well find a way out
3708,she may have wanted to dear boy she wanted to save our lives
3709,i hope shes reached her place of perfection
3710,she didnt understand she couldnt understand she wanted to save our lives and perhaps the lives of all the other beings of the solar system i hope shes found her perfection oh how i shall always remember her as one of the daughters of the gods yes as one of the daughters of the gods
3711,judging by the position of those planets we shall land quite soon
3712,oh havent we sufficient powerdrive to land safely
3713,yes youve got a point there where can we land
3714,but can we land
3715,yes i heard that now dont concern yourselves over me i can look after myself the most important factor is this taranium
3716,and i think were just wasting valuable time sitting about here waiting for this man baxter or daxtor or whatever he call himself
3717,surely everyone must know that chens spaceship has crashlanded only a short distance away from here there must be hundreds of people looking for us
3718,but this is an experimental plant theres no scientists no staff nobody we might just as well have landed ourselves on an empty planet what on earth is happening
3719,has it occurred to you by any chance that we might have deliberately walked into an ambush
3720,quite true and then he gave a rather pompous speech of selfsatisfaction and handed over the core of the time destructor to the daleks
3721,a lust for more power than he already has universal power
3722,yes quite so so whatever plans you have its essential that steven and i return to the planet kembel i want to recover something of unique value
3723,no
3724,i suggest you ask daxtar what he is playing at
3725,what price is mavic chen paying you for your treachery
3726,long acquaintance is no guarantee for honesty ask him ask him how he came to know that the core of their time destructor was taranium
3727,i did not sir how long have you been in this conspiracy
3728,there is you and chen and how many of the others or what others are involved
3729,you brainless idiot how many times have i told you about taking lives we have other ways and means of dealing with evil doers
3730,possibly but now we shall never know whom we can trust
3731,and how do you propose to do that
3732,yes possibly we filled in the story long before he gave himself away
3733,yes possible if you hadnt killed daxtar of course there wouldnt be any need to
3734,well theres not much point in standing here discussing it any longer we shall have to try out your scheme though i very much doubt of any sort of success that he might have
3735,wheres bret
3736,oh hes an irritating man come along in here quickly
3737,now i wonder what that is
3738,yes it could be some kind of transmitter
3739,well i suggest you stay at that door and if you hear any noise outside its bound to be him
3740,mice yes perhaps its some kind of experiment
3741,let me speak please
3742,the mice couldnt have done that
3743,all right all right all right
3744,calm down calm down i dont know where we are were safe and sound thats the main thing oh i suppose she had to come along
3745,yes im very glad you took that gun away from her is she all right
3746,pull yourself together madam i want to ask you a few questions
3747,take a good look round dear boy and find a place to hide weve a lot to sort out
3748,quiet do as youre told get on your feet youre lucky to be alive now you come with me but dont try any tricks come along  sara and the doctor head off after steven     dalek 1
3749,getting away from this place sets quite a problem
3750,at the moment i havent the faintest idea
3751,cellular dissemination
3752,to put it in lay language cellular dissemination means our bodies were broken up by some process or other shot through into the fourth dimension and at a given point reassembled again on this planet
3753,fantastic it may be my boy but impossible no because precisely that is what has happened
3754,yes that followed along too and i believe its sending messages back to earth now that would mean that mavic chen will know precisely where we are therefore the daleks will attack once again    dalek 1
3755,i might have know it visians the planet mira
3756,im afraid it is my dear
3757,leave her my boy theres nothing we can do she finally believes us
3758,steven listen to me both of you this is the planet mira and the only beings on here are the visians we cant see them but theyre very vicious we must try to get away from here as soon as possible
3759,i dont know yet
3760,yes and it appears were trapped
3761,i dont think theyve quite fathomed us out
3762,and you remember my boy aim high these visians are eight feet tall
3763,im afraid my friends the daleks have won  episode 6  coronas of the sun
3764,if i do what guarantee is there that you wont fire your guns afterwards
3765,you dare not fire because of this taranium to end this stalemate may i suggest
3766,theres a good boy keep going    dalek 2
3767,theres only one guard now you know what to do
3768,i certainly will ive come to give myself up
3769,i have i realise of course that i am no match for the daleks so if i hand it over will you help me and my friends to get away from this planet
3770,oh they will come when i call them the taranium shall i give it to you or would you prefer me to hand it to you in your ship
3771,escape oh my tin friend never you mustnt forget that i came here and surrendered of my own free will
3772,oh dont worry my dear im quite accustomed to this dalek technique close the hatches please  dalek
3773,the power buildup is far too slow feed in that extra energy
3774,it should activate at five zero zero  daleks
3775,splendid  dalek 2
3776,autogiro giro dynamo
3777,discharge
3778,splendid hold tight
3779,no course it wont my dear boy thats the whole point
3780,no we shall have to make a copy a copy so exact that we can deceive the daleks theyll still want this taranium back you know they wont rest until they get it
3781,yes thank you thank you my dear thank you ill have a good try and i think that will give us sufficient breathing space whats that
3782,good gracious were on the course for the planet kembel you know im very much afraid that were under the dalek influence
3783,yes of course there is my dear boy of course there is come along young lady lets get on with our mineral while we still have the time
3784,yes i think so yes yes there thats a good copy although i say it myself
3785,i appreciate that young lady but this is the right balance and the right weight
3786,oh good good good well you keep watching theres a good fellow
3787,no i should try that one
3788,isnt it
3789,oh were working on that yes were working on it
3790,too primitive my boy too primitive and far too dangerous
3791,back to the planet kembel but what you know it appears that were being affected by magnetization were been held in a very strong beam
3792,lets try and break it child come along
3793,my dear boy what happened whats happened hes still breathing
3794,hes still alive and lucky at that
3795,oh isnt that wonderful thats wonderful stevens theory has proved successful but what about the poor boy
3796,yes we should be landing in about five minutes
3797,no my dear hes adapting to it can you talk my boy no hes still under the influence of that force field nothing further will happen to you now dont worry
3798,yes yes im afraid so sara bring me that fake taranium yes yes yes now listen to me steven try and understand this is very important so you must trust me you do understand just try and indicate
3799,were here now weve got to face the daleks open the doors please steven will lead the way this way steven
3800,its our only chance my dear and remember i will do all the talking
3801,no and remember you cannot fire because of the taranium youd have another fifty years work
3802,i will hand over the taranium outside my ship the tardis
3803,outside my ship the tardis or nowhere
3804,thank you steven
3805,sara open the door please the young man will give you the taranium when the girl and i are safely inside my ship the tardis
3806,remember to do exactly as i say steven i will give you further instructions from inside my tardis    doctor
3807,the dalek guns must have destroyed that forcefield completely its a good thing they didnt fire a second time
3808,you had a shield round you you know similar to that one that protects the tardis oh thats remind me where is that genuine taranium
3809,certainly not what you did was very dangerous and extremely stupid
3810,one more experiment like that and you really will be dead
3811,now now now you listen to me young man i warned you it was dangerous before you tried it you might have killed yourself and blown up the spaceship then where would we all be
3812,now now now now dont be cheeky
3813,i dont care what you think were not going to repeat it why do you think science turned down your discovery because it isnt safe so perhaps in future youll pay attention to what i say and remember that i happen to be the leader of this expedition and i dont want to keep on repeating myself
3814,never mind the buts if you dont like it you can get off
3815,i hope not
3816,whats the matter
3817,oh tut tut tut that scanners not working
3818,yes i shall have to repair it of course yes yes but that means checking up on the whole circuit
3819,ah ah ah dont you dare touch that
3820,well just look at those dials look look here sara you see those dials now you know what that means if either of you went outside it would be extremely dangerous the whole atmosphere is entirely poisonous  episode 7  the feast of steven
3821,will neither of you understand
3822,no where you come from in both places the air is pure outside there is the worst kind of pollution ive met in years
3823,ah my dear boy im used to all sorts of atmospheres it wont affect me i shall have to go out and do the repairing myself
3824,then and only then can you come out but you must be very very careful
3825,my dear young man just give me a few minutes and if all is well i shall be back inside again to tell you
3826,now look here my boy you will do as youre told now you just open the doors and remember to close them after ive gone
3827,good evening  constable 1
3828,oh nonsense child were back on earth
3829,oh never mind never mind i shall have to go outside and try and distract them meanwhile you can stay here for a while then come out and do the scanner
3830,never mind what i said my dear boy do as youre told now open the doors and remember to shut them after ive gone
3831,hmm  constable 2
3832,havent i seen your face before somewhere
3833,yes of course i remember now yes the marketplace at jaffa
3834,oh christmas oh is it of course yes yes yes yes that accounts for the holly in the hall
3835,well of course i didnt know i travel about too much
3836,well a quest of knowledge dear boy i mean you have a saying in this country have you not travel broadens the mind
3837,no gracious no
3838,no
3839,oh youll have to think in a far bigger way than that your ideas are too narrow too small too crippled
3840,well i suppose you might say that i am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot  constable 2
3841,i dont think you really understand that object in the yard out there isnt really a police box
3842,it is a machine for investigating time and relative dimensions in space    constable 2
3843,do i take it that you gentlemen are imputing that i am mentally deranged  constable 2
3844,of course of course and what are you doing here
3845,enough of the old man either whats all this funny accent
3846,well even i dear boy must admit that i enjoyed myself did you fix the scanner
3847,oh
3848,have you checked it
3849,never mind never mind is the taranium safe
3850,now thats one thing you mustnt do my dear remember they have the same type of machines and they can follow us
3851,no i sincerely hope not
3852,i dont think the daleks will attack the solar system until theyve checked their time destructor
3853,well i think we might perhaps be able to destroy the taranium before they catch us up
3854,yes we might we might still be on earth wait a minute
3855,wheres sara
3856,in here quick
3857,no i must find sara
3858,ill try out there first you wait here
3859,hmm
3860,certainly certainly my help oh i shall be delighted yes
3861,doctor please
3862,oh yes and who is this
3863,nonsense you put some more clothes on child go along and whats all this
3864,come on to the wardrobe the wardrobe
3865,now come along we must go back to the tardis this is a madhouse its all full of arabs come along
3866,come back you two
3867,whats that
3868,arent there well thats a joke in itself
3869,quite quite now would you mind moving
3870,done by chaplin
3871,now would you excuse me
3872,yes
3873,custard pies and bing crosby ha
3874,here we are
3875,well we so rarely get a chance to celebrate but this time we must
3876,yes its christmas
3877,dont you remember the police station christmas
3878,heres a toast a happy christmas to all of us
3879,incidentally a happy christmas to all of you at home       dalek 1
3880,my dear this machine can only tell us were being followed ot who by
3881,yes a hasty conclusion but possibly right although i dont understand how they could have tested that taranium so quickly
3882,oh nonsense my dear
3883,yes yes
3884,pretty soon my dear pretty soon
3885,i know full well what im doing child now dont get so excited
3886,hmm yes i see yes i must do something drastic
3887,landing my dear thats what you wanted wasnt it
3888,yes its definitely some sporting occasion
3889,oh possibly my dear fellow possibly
3890,yes my plan hasnt worked following us closely
3891,no we must take off quite soon
3892,no my boy we havent shaken them off whoever it was following us has landed theyve landed out there
3893,my dear young girl what good would it be to run away the sooner we find whos pursuing us the better
3894,yes well i can well imagine that this is a new planet my boy its cooling down cooling down fascinating yes extremely fascinating i wonder i wonder whod take the time and trouble to follow us yes i think there is an explanation but unlikely possible very possible
3895,oh youll see my boy youll see
3896,you lack one quality of all the others my boy and that is patience
3897,ah tut tut tut my dear monk now dont be so ridiculous put that down at once
3898,oh no complaints no and you
3899,i suppose congratulations for your escape are quite in order
3900,yes a very interesting solution yes im sure though i think it would make for rather an uncomfortable ride however i dont suppose it affected you very much being an amateur
3901,yes i suppose so
3902,and you returned here for one obvious reason did you not
3903,yes yes quite quite tell me any plans
3904,dont waste your breath young man the most important thing is is to find out what hes done to the tardis come on
3905,that means we cannot get back into the tardis child
3906,yes like i am i suppose
3907,oh and why not dear boy why not because i am using my brain im trying to solve this problem
3908,perhaps nothing perhaps everything will you do as youre told at once cover your eyes please
3909,wait a moment child
3910,yes i know my boy i know
3911,quite so dear boy hell be on our trail again as fast as he can get going
3912,exactly my dear exactly now steven theres something i want you to do go to that indicator and let me know the instant the monks tardis registers
3913,oh thats all very simple dear boy you see the sun in that particular galaxy has very unusual powers i merely reflected its powers through that ring
3914,yes it has certain properties the combined forces of that sun together with the stone in that ring was sufficient enough to correct the monks interference
3915,now i dont want to discuss this anymore please about turn and do as youre told go along
3916,no
3917,i dont quite know you just listen my dear listen      dalek
3918,well as far as i can remember ive seen them behave in a fashion like that on a former occasion
3919,the relief of mafeking
3920,well its hard to say my boy but i think that its going to be a little more difficult than i thought
3921,yes but i dont think so for much longer its about time you know that that wretched monk landed and i think he will quite soon
3922,well yes the pyramids are the seventh wonder of this ancient world i should say the word impressive is rather an understatement
3923,would you mind passing me the diatrab dear boy please
3924,yes i think perhaps it would be a good idea if you keep your eye on the monk so if you climb higher talking to myself     dalek 2
3925,calm down calm down whats all the fuss is that you bawling your head off
3926,now thats very good yes very good now please excuse me
3927,oh my dear young man i have no intention of leaving the tardis unlocked and another thing you should know do you realise i had to strip the whole of this mechanism down before i could put it right
3928,oh i dont know but anyway i dare say i can catch you up somewhere but be careful you know that monk can be very harmful if he wants to
3929,well thats finished now i must go i wonder where those other two are now sara steven
3930,good heavens youre given an opportunity you didnt before
3931,youre wasting your time you wont get in
3932,for a time yes for a time ive been glad to you know i dont think i would have found my tardis without the help of that energy counter
3933,yes like your machine i suppose
3934,well you know my way has its advantages the egyptians thought it was a very good idea otherwise they wouldnt have brought it in here as for your machine well its probably disguised as a what a sort of a block of stone
3935,not your machine no i didnt realise it at the time
3936,really
3937,and then you would be able to see the taranium too
3938,warn me
3939,why didnt you
3940,warn me
3941,you know i think before i go i should put you safely out of the way
3942,i did
3943,if you believe that my friend you will believe anything
3944,where are they
3945,where are they
3946,very well i will hand over the taranium core
3947,but on my terms
3948,no escort and on my terms
3949,yes indeed indeed you could but then youd never get back the taranium core would you now hmm would you
3950,you will release your prisoners i also include that monk fellow too though i dont know why i should bother with him bring all three to the place of rendezvous and hand them over at the same time
3951,you should know the answer to that as well as i do none of you can be trusted you and one dalek at the west angle of the great pyramid
3952,mavic chen walk towards me dalek halt mavic chen you have disregard my conditions i said one dalek
3953,before we go any further you will release your hostages then and only then will i hand you the taranium core
3954,away all of you mavic chen join me at the back here i am now about to hand over the taranium core to mavic chen follow me
3955,im afraid not young man
3956,i had to hand the real taranium core over to mavic chen i know i should have tried to get him but it was hopeless there was so much chaos going on and now its too late
3957,except this
3958,that is the directional unit from the monks tardis
3959,perhaps perhaps
3960,yes i suppose it is but that isnt all my dear
3961,i think not dear boy i had to take precautionary measures in case my plans didnt work now whilst i was collecting that unit i changed the monks tardis into a police telephone box
3962,yes yes exactly like mine well of course the daleks will be on our track but i think should my plan succeed they will find the monk
3963,i dont care if hes in timbuktu
3964,oh i shouldnt worry any more my dear boy theres no doubt about it hes right away by now
3965,perhaps yes perhaps one day at the moment i should say that hes had quite enough for us for a while having taken his directional unit it will take him quite a time to make the necessary repairs to his ship
3966,well im not certain its a mark four remember there are two possibilities one it would work
3967,number two the increased energy rate will certainly destroy the centre column
3968,yes my dear a chance a slim one     dalek 2
3969,there we are thats finished its a pity we havent got a more reliable way of testing it
3970,oh yes it is finished my dear but er
3971,yes you realise of course were taking a terrible chance
3972,very well my boy pull the main switch    episode 11  the abandoned planet
3973,well fortunately theres no damage done to the control panel itself
3974,oh thats useless dear boy useless take a look for yourself
3975,well the unit required a much higher energy rate then we possess
3976,a builtin safety measure my dear you see the excess energy must have forced itself back into the directional unit and that means that our plans to return to kembel have failed
3977,yes and theres nothing that we can do about it
3978,well our only chance my dear is to try and capture the monks time machine or that of the daleks
3979,have patience dear boy its highly probable theyve all left by now and i should think theres one or two of those egyptians around lets take a look on the scanner
3980,yes its vaguely familiar it might be kembel do you know that means that that directional unit must have burned itself out after wed dematerialised i wonder if youd bring that er that impulse compass
3981,well now young lady perhaps youll have more faith in me in the future i thought something would work out
3982,oh nonsense nonsense
3983,of course it was
3984,yes well perhaps perhaps anyway now were here i think wed better make a plan
3985,ive no idea though i think we might be able to make it on foot perhaps id better go out and take some bearings open the door dear boy
3986,dont say anything just do what i tell you take that
3987,yes now when i tell you i want you to take sara back to the tardis you still have that power impulse compass
3988,good now follow bearing 627 to the tardis
3989,shush there is no use in all of us taking risks you must do as i say
3990,i followed a dalek here of course now let me get on i am going to activate the time destructor
3991,ah ha thats it
3992,i am afraid youre too late the time destructor is activated
3993,no you cannot fire can you you dare not if you were to yes you could kill us but you would totally destroy your equipment i think it is checkmate send one of your daleks over here remember the time destructor is working working slowly but if you disobey me i can accelerate it
3994,turn about you two behind it steven take my stick and clamp it down on his gun forward
3995,do as i say quickly
3996,what are you doing here
3997,you must remember my child this machine is working its working slowly because its range is rather small at the moment but it is working now if you start to feel strange you must let me know at once
3998,first back to the tardis is steven not with you
3999,hurry my child hurry
4000,my dear are you beginning to feel strange
4001,yes well perhaps its this time destructor having an effect on the elements
4002,no no thats impossible my dear theres one thing i do know about this machine it will continue until the taranium has finally burnt itself out our only chance is to get back to the tardis then i can neutralise it
4003,its not far now sara
4004,the time destructor is
4005,no dont touch me
4006,you must get back to the ship go forward
4007,the daleks
4008,mavic chens taranium core has finally burnt itself out
4009,yes my boy so do i you know steven the one thing that sara lived for was to see the total destruction of the daleks well now its all over without her help this could never have been achieved
4010,millions of years of progress reversed back
4011,well my boy we finally rid this planet of daleks
4012,what a waste what a terrible waste    next episode  war of god ltback to the episode listing
4013,oh nonsense my boy its perfectly safe in there yes france yes most certainly
4014,hmm
4015,well by the look of those houses i would say medieval although i suppose it might be as late as the seventeenth century
4016,did you see that weve landed in the middle of the sixteenth century yes and that was the very time
4017,yes that strange brotherhood of apothecaries way ahead of their time now what was the name of that man that lived in paris er pre preslin preslin thats the man yes the most advanced man of them all i must try to get to see him
4018,quite so dear boy well now dont let us dawdle we must go in and change
4019,youd be surprised what ive got in my wardrobe but i want to turn over a few old papers yes come along theres no time to lose come along come along come along
4020,it wont be of the least interest to you dear boy landlord wine
4021,i shall do nothing of the sort i am going to visit preslin he lives on the other side of paris somewhere near port saint martin i believe thank you i just want to sit down and have a talk with him about his work are you interested in germinology
4022,well there you are you see and you know nothing about the period do you youd only be found out for the man that you are
4023,well in that case i shant visit preslin
4024,well
4025,but you promise me you wont get into trouble
4026,well try not to talk to anyone and come back here this evening and well go off to the tardis together
4027,quite quite youll need that
4028,and dont cut yourself with that sword
4029,i am looking for charles preslin
4030,oh but this is his shop
4031,where
4032,oh dear dear dear now isnt that a pity and i did so want to talk to him about his work
4033,trouble not at all im a scientist too i merely wish to discuss his work with him
4034,yes perhaps to you but he was a man who searched deeply in nature i didnt think he was a faint heart
4035,i see yes he also discovered small creatures which if attacking humanity could cause a very serious illness
4036,no
4037,yes in science news travels yes and theres a man in germany at the moment whos working on optics trying to make a machine which will enable preslin to see these small creatures he calls them germs
4038,yes so now doesnt this encourage you to continue with your theories monsieur preslin
4039,of course of course my dear fellow but im extremely curious about your work monsieur preslin
4040,yes i suppose just now all churchmen are rather suspicious of your work but surely you can carry on without his knowledge
4041,i suppose theres no point in going to see him
4042,hmm i wonder
4043,he is not
4044,oh my dear boy had you stayed at the tavern all this mixup could have been avoided
4045,yes well i was unavoidably delayed never mind that now come along we must go come along
4046,what oh that wretched curfew is the start of so much trouble
4047,i told you not to get involved
4048,whats that
4049,did you say tomorrow was saint bartholomews day child
4050,what year is this my boy
4051,what date is it child
4052,yes yes yes i know that the year the year hmm
4053,go home anne you must leave here at once
4054,where were you working
4055,you go back there
4056,you must leave this shop child
4057,oh please dont interfere now my dear there must be somewhere you can stay in paris
4058,oh nonsense tonight you will be quite safe now you go carefully through the streets
4059,well youve been out in the curfew before havent you
4060,then you know how to avoid the patrols you go back to your aunt youll be quite safe and you take my advice and stay indoors tomorrow now do you understand its too dangerous for you to stay here now off you go child come along off off off
4061,ah sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
4062,now off you go my child off you go
4063,my dear steven the catholics will have other things on their minds tonight she will be quite safe now then you and i must leave paris at once come
4064,there is no time for me to explain come along boy come along
4065,yes we shall have to get past them to get back to the tardis
4066,oh no no its far too dangerous
4067,for the moment we just wait  guard 2
4068,i know i know just keep quiet
4069,no nothing nothing in any case i cannot change the course of history you know that the massacre continued for several days in paris and then spread itself to other parts of france oh what a senseless waste what a terrible page of the past
4070,yes most of them about ten thousand in paris alone
4071,yes
4072,anne chaplet
4073,well it is possible of course she didnt die and i was right to leave her
4074,i was not responsible
4075,weve landed your mind is made up
4076,my dear steven history sometimes gives us a terrible shock and that is because we dont quite fully understand why should we after all were all too small to realise its final pattern therefore dont try and judge it from where you stand i was right to do as i did yes that i firmly believe

4098,well thats what im trying to find out dear boy
4099,exactly my dear
4100,yes youre quite right my boy yes and top of everything else its a jungle without a sky
4101,no sun no clouds merely a metal roof radiating some kind of light
4102,yes and plus something else

4128,including the daleks
4129,segment to use your phrase sir what segment are we in now
4130,good gracious we must have jumped at least ten million years
4131,seven hundred years but why travel that far surely

4133,oh yes indeed
4134,thank you
4135,we may be able to help
4136,do you realise what this means dear boy
4137,all all these people this generation have never experienced the common cold for the simple reason it was wiped out many generations ago before they were born they have no resistance to it
4138,i dont quite know i dont know but it might be fatal and we shall be to blame yes its all our fault and i should have foreseen it
4139,but
4140,well im not sure dear boy we shall just have to wait and see
4141,well you did come my dear so its too late to be worry about that and stop snivelling
4142,but of course they care my dear now dont worry its not your fault at all if its anybodys its mine
4143,oh i dont want to think it about it dear boy its too horrifying though i must say that were usually very healthy

4145,oh do blow your nose child its running all over the place
4146,well look my dear do try and rest you know you may be feeling better but youre far from cured oh if only those wretched guardians would let us out of here i might be able to help

4165,exactly my child yes
4166,oh and my child
4167,that also includes your father
4168,yes i know im a bit of a quack but the combination of these two membrane fluids a little at a time should do the trick
4169,well i dont see why not yes now where is that sterilised postule
4170,well i dont see why not my dear providing ive mixed these properly
4171,oh dont let that cross our minds for heavens sake now then here we are
4172,what with a hypodermic needle good gracious no that went out a long time ago there we are now all we have to do is to wait and watch come along
4173,im going to treat the others precisely the same way as ive treated steven
4174,well its going to be much dodgier my child as you say if i just sat and did nothing come along
4175,no its just a matter of time my dear come along
4176,yes i think ive given him the right treatment
4177,well its about an hour my dear he seems to be reacting quite normally yes hes fighting it
4178,the fevers down and the temperatures dropped
4179,i mean hes going to be all right my dear
4180,you have nothing further to worry about sir the sick have been tended to and the others immunised against further attack
4181,oh splendid splendid
4182,now you can continue with the building of your statue and when its finished im sure its going to look very beautiful
4183,well we must be off goodbye sir
4184,goodbye my dear

4186,you really must let me go first child
4187,take a look at this my boy isnt it extraordinary well now thats inexplicable
4188,what is it my dear what have you found
4189,well im not sure dear boy however the statues finished that means seven hundred years must have passed since we�last stood here
4190,yes i know my dear its pretty hard for you to understand
4191,yes i think youre right
4192,i dont think that will be necessary dear boy it appears theyve introduced some form of automatic guiding device
4193,yes well now lets have a look at the scanner and see if that may help
4194,yes hes not the only one whos doing that
4195,yes it appears the monoids have become overlords
4196,we are visitors to this spaceship we were here many centuries ago we come as friends  monoid 2
4197,i see and the human beings  monoid 2
4198,shush child  monoid 1
4199,and what do you mean by that  monoid 1
4200,if i were to tell you young man you wouldnt believe me
4201,hell probably die one unless we do something quickly about this situation
4202,yes we shall have to be pretty urgent too time is running out     monoid 1
4203,let us return to the launcher and send a message back to the ark tell them they can make their landings quite safely im sure theyll be extremely delighted to hear it
4204,we were all wrong this place is inhabited come see for yourselves
4205,shall we find out  monoid 2
4206,put that thing down that is no way to establish friendship  monoid 2
4207,i think it comes from within this room  monoid 2
4208,and that was their aim to land there and recreate life on this planet  refusian oc
4209,nothing my dear we shall just have to wait until the next party lands
4210,well in that case we shall just have to stay here       monoid 3
4211,yes thats true my dear but you mustnt think they were perfect oh no sometimes they were extremely intolerant and selfish  refusian
4212,yes one day thank you
4213,quite so my dear quite so
4214,now
4215,oh thank heaven steven my boy youre safe now listen the ark is about to blow up
4216,oh im glad you heard that you know these launchers are simple to operate and i would like to suggest my friend that you fly them back to the ark  refusian
4217,i dont know i havent seen one  monoid 1
4218,what is more important is the ark still all right
4219,we have found the bomb we must warn them immediately come along
4220,splendid come along
4221,hes right a long time ago your ancestors accepted responsibility for the welfare of these monoids they were treated like slaves so no wonder when they got the chance they repaid you in kind  refusian
4222,yes you must travel with understanding as well as hope you know i once said that to one of your ancestors a long time ago however we must be going goodbye
4223,good that means the gravitational bearing must have rectified itself
4224,good that means the gravitational bearing must have rectified itself
4225,what do you mean dear boy im still here
4226,what oh nonsense child nonsense
4227,youre wrong this is something far more serious were in grave danger this is some form of attack
4228,that may be my boy but wherever it is it has great power and can penetrate our safety barrier    doctor
4229,hmm what is it
4230,oh you can see me
4231,well splendid splendid
4232,well im not quite sure dear boy but its its somewhat familiar
4233,no wait child wait
4234,well i dont think it was the refusians influence that made me become intangible no i think it was something here and i dont like the feel of the place anymore than you do but we have to face up to it you know i think i was meant to come here
4235,but i believe i now know where we are
4236,now turn around this instant turn away from it dear boy were now in the world of the celestial toymaker and that screen is hypnotic hes trying to dominate your mind
4237,there is nothing there do you understand me there is nothing there at all you must believe me
4238,come here child now whatever you do you must not allow yourself to be trapped into looking at it
4239,hes a power for evil he manipulates people and makes them into his playthings whatever you do neither of you must look at that screen its a trap
4240,you i might have guessed
4241,turn away from it this instant
4242,you and your inventions ha now both of you be very careful this place is a hidden menace nothing is just for fun
4243,hes trying to get us into his power thats why weve got to fight him
4244,my dear but how that is the question
4245,no
4246,you will kindly cease this practical joking and let us go at once
4247,and now you have so let us go
4248,and very wise i was too you and your games are quite notorious you draw people here like a spider does to flies
4249,and should they lose the game they play you condemn them to become your toy forever
4250,and if i refuse
4251,no i do not i should never have left the tardis
4252,another one of your conjuring tricks what game is it you want me to play
4253,the trilogic game
4254,you infer that my mind is getting weak and old
4255,how dare you
4256,of course i can
4257,you need me
4258,as you said if i win the game i can go
4259,i am only allowed to move one piece at a time
4260,and i am not permitted to put a larger piece on a small piece
4261,i see can i begin
4262,you are not asking them to play this game
4263,competitive and who are the others
4264,quest what quest
4265,dodo steven this is the doctor the game youre going to play is not so innocent as it looks be on your guard    doctor
4266,i havent made a mistake yet
4267,theyll win too
4268,what do you mean
4269,that game i might have known
4270,throughout this game you have spent a great deal of trouble in trying to break my concentration and its very unlikely that you will succeed now
4271,you seem to say quite enough for both of us in any case im busy
4272,i think your friend cyril wont do so well when steven catches up with him
4273,well i was right
4274,no not yet excuse me  yes i see steven and dodo have found the tardis one little trick and your little trick is broken i am now visible
4275,i am glad you take it so calmly well now if you will excuse me i will go and see if the tardis is all right
4276,well done my boy
4277,yes im back with you well done im very glad to hear that youre bringing logic into your guesses
4278,yes my dear and i think it was high time that we were off
4279,well i dont think thats going to be likely dear boy  toymaker
4280,now dont start red herrings you charlatan  toymaker
4281,no my dear boy hes just tricking us into despair take no notice of him  toymaker
4282,well i am compelled to tell the truth it is possible that the toymaker can drag us down in defeat with him unless
4283,well its all very simple its a matter of the battle of our brains
4284,yes we still have a chance but we must proceed with cunning  toymaker
4285,well said my boy well said  toymaker
4286,oh its no use steven leave him
4287,hes using his mind to turn your strength against yourself now go back into the tardis i will deal with him
4288,never never my friend you have been defeated
4289,what have you done stop meddling with my ship
4290,your infantile behaviour is beyond a joke no of course i mustnt you very nearly caught me then
4291,but if i do this place vanishes
4292,and if this place vanishes then the tardis and the rest of us will vanish also
4293,close the doors my boy
4294,its no use
4295,if we destroy the toymaker we destroy this world
4296,i dont think neither of you understand as the games are over and won by us everything outside the tardis disappears and if we are there we disappear also
4297,but it will my dear the moment i go out there and make the final move of the trilogic game
4298,oh he wont be
4299,if the toymaker loses the game his world will vanish but he has the power to build a new one
4300,the toymaker is immortal hes lasted for thousands of years very occasionally of course he loses a game and then he has to pay the price
4301,yes but he himself is not destroyed he goes on forever
4302,there must be a way      doctor
4303,i will not come out and make that final move  toymaker
4304,oh nonsense dear boy you dont want to disappear
4305,yes well thats very noble and kind of you but i absolutely forbid it youve done quite enough in getting the tardis back
4306,we can thats just it thats just what we can do listen to me i will make that final move     doctor
4307,very well  preset for dematerialisation  go to move 1023  go from move 1023 master switch
4308,my dear boy it was your very idea your very idea dont you see when the toymaker wanted to move the pieces he had to command them in a certain tone of voice to make them move at all
4309,yes but in the first place you see i couldnt because i used my own voice
4310,exactly dear boy exactly therefore i had to imitate the toymakers voice to make them obey me and they did
4311,oh my dear dont talk too soon the mind is indestructible so is the toymaker
4312,yes just at this moment but there will be other meetings in an other time
4313,yes youre quite right my dear but anyway let us cheer up after all we did win the games
4314,with what
4315,what are those
4316,this is really interesting the last present from the toymaker i wonder
4317,oh ive got the most ghastly toothache its paralysing pain

4447,i certainly hope that i should not be here when steven and dodo come back
4448,well this is utterly absurd nothing will ever induce me to raise a gun in anger
4449,howdy would you mind not calling me pop
4450,now mister werp what part am i supposed to be playing in this feud between you and the clantons i thought that you gave me this to uphold the law not
4451,my main concern is for the safety of steven and dodo now cant i ask you to change your mind
4452,steven what in the world
4453,well if hes there its not a matter of choice hes still searching for dodo with ringo
4454,oh this is sheer madness mister sheriff you cant take on the clantons and ringo
4455,oh my dear im not in the slightest bit of danger it was you that we were worried about
4456,but this is ridiculous gentleman can you not uphold the law without using firearms
4457,oh good heavens what a relief here you are bat theres your badge and there is your wretched weapon
4458,yes what is your way doctor holliday
4459,oh how can i possibly sleep my dear knowing that steven is mixed up with all this
4460,yes but im not just worrying about steven my dear what about this man mister werp supposing he gets killed who is going to uphold law and order in this territory why they couldnt let masterson handle the affair i dont know with a posse of deputies and at the end of it let the clantons get a fair trial
4461,me but my dear sheriff i should have thought you were the one to convince
4462,yes i see
4463,yes quite so my dear that thought had passed through my head yes well mister sheriff if you need my assistance i certainly will go along and talk to them
4464,mister clanton i presume
4465,no not doctor at the moment dear boy i am deputysheriff of tombstone
4466,ive come along to ask you to call off your boys from embarking on this ridiculous duel
4467,and if youll do this im sure that masterson will see that they get a fair trial
4468,i see you would prefer them to be shot down in the street
4469,ah tut tut tut tut tut if you are alluding to the presence of mister ringo i can assure you sir that that also has been anticipated theyre quite ready for him
4470,you have been sadly misinformed doctor holliday is there also
4471,why on earth you want to leave tombstone i cant imagine all the clantons are dead ringo is dead
4472,its a very good likeness
4473,thank you
4474,its a terrible terrible injustice you know im very tempted to
4475,oh my dear dodo my dear dodo you know youre fast becoming a prey to every clich�ridden convention in the american west and its high time we left now come along

4488,good gracious no did you expect me to be
4489,oh theyre very pleasant yes theyre both very pleasant apart from their juvenile exuberances im sure youll like them they must be at the back here somewhere i think theyre rather worried because im a bit late joining them
4490,must
4491,oh yes of course yes yes yes i shall come with you in the meantime young man i wonder if youd mind trying to find my young people for me steven and dodo tell them the doctor sent you
4492,well thats very kind of you to make me feel so welcome
4493,well my dear sir thats very good of you yes yes very good of you indeed yes i dont remember being so highly honoured before like this anywhere ive been
4494,oh come come my dear sir i know that youve been very responsible for vast scientific research and at the same time i always knew a race existed of great intelligence in this segment of the universe
4495,you have you have indeed you have and if i may so say thank you dear ladies for making me appear so grand
4496,ah there you are both of you well i dont think i was so far wrong my boy what do i look like my dear
4497,yes with what my dear
4498,yes and i was right they are very highly developed civilised minds
4499,oh yes thank you
4500,an excellent idea sir well my boy now perhaps youll believe me next time i tell you i know precisely where i am
4501,well gentlemen i cant just sit here in all these grand clothes without asking a few questions after all theres my reputation to think about
4502,well if i accept your gifts i must endorse your life but i cant do that without knowing something about you
4503,yes i know very well that you are far advanced than most planets but how you achieve this i know not and lets face it gentlemen you are much advanced now i would like to know how
4504,oh yes its quite obvious to the meanest intellect that well how can i say that youve found a much more effective source of energy
4505,to a member of your community
4506,yes of course you need a very high form of life to make this source effective
4507,my dear steven you must not come bursting into the room like this well
4508,gone what do you mean gone
4509,well i really dont know what all this fuss is about im sure the child wont come to any harm while she here
4510,if i know that young lady shes well enough to look after herself now come along please lets finish the conversation
4511,tut tut tut
4512,a very interesting discussion gentlemen yes i must say
4513,not for the moment my dear
4514,do you my boy well im afraid i cant just now ive had a very interesting discussion with these gentlemen you know i have some documents which i think that you might be interested to see theyre records of my investigations into time travel you might find them rather surprising
4515,yes just for the moment but i wont be long
4516,oh splendid my boy thank you i need someone to help me carry a few things
4517,no no thank you that wont be necessary thank you indeed well come along my dear we dont want to lose you again do we
4518,ah now wait a minute let me see where are we
4519,because i didnt want those gentlemen to overhear what you were saying child
4520,precisely
4521,not altogether
4522,nothing really but i sense that things arent all together right here now i think we go this way isnt it come along
4523,what
4524,really but hes not moving yes yes lets take a look hold that here
4525,was he in this condition when you met him before
4526,did he come out of that laboratory
4527,yes yes yes i think i do yes its just as i feared
4528,yes their wonderful civilisation is based on this theyve discovered a way of extracting lifes force from human beings and absorbing it into themselves leaving the victim as you see almost dead
4529,heres the key to the tardis my boy now i want you to go to the emergency cabinet and you will see a container with capsules marked d403 bring it back here as soon as you can i think we might be able to do something for the poor man
4530,meanwhile take that i dont want it anymore
4531,what do you know of this
4532,what are you doing fellow leave the man alone hell probably die
4533,i insist that you leave him alone
4534,i think i understand only too well
4535,this human being
4536,they are men human beings like you and me although it appears at the moment that youre behaving in a rather subhuman fashion
4537,i forbid you to touch him
4538,i am looking after this wretched fellow
4539,i have already told you im busy im going to take care of this poor man
4540,hmm
4541,so your rewards are only for the people that agree with you
4542,oppose you indeed i am going to oppose you just in the same way that i oppose the daleks or any other menace to common humanity
4543,human progress sir how dare you call your treatment of these people progress
4544,i fail to see the difference
4545,exploitation indeed this sir is protracted murder
4546,the sacrifice of even one soul is far too great you must put an end to this inhuman practice
4547,so this is the place where you carry out your foul experiments
4548,thank you whats this
4549,oh yes yes interested yes although i disapprove of your activities
4550,no gentlemen no gentlemen i dont wish to bear witness
4551,i should hope not my boy
4552,what did you say
4553,i think you have forgotten one thing gentlemen
4554,my feelings in this matter i will not submit to your nauseating experiments i am going out of that door so dont try to stop me
4555,let me pass
4556,not at jano
4557,you must not harm jano
4558,please carry out my instructions and do not harm jano
4559,yes i think so my dear i must have fallen into some kind of a coma it was as though as though all my powers were being sapped
4560,where am i where am i
4561,no no my dear no no we cant leave yet no weve got a lot of work to do
4562,yes yes i dont intend to leave these people in this oppressed state
4563,yes youre probably right my boy i shant even try
4564,i am going to destroy the power that they hold over you
4565,yes precisely
4566,all we need is one friend from the other side
4567,i think we have him already my dear
4568,all of them
4569,yes i think you will find theyve left one behind
4570,yes well theres no need to my boy
4571,theres no need for that my boy
4572,shush shush shush shush  jano
4573,yes i am here jano we were expecting you
4574,oh my dear jano it wasnt difficult i knew you were to undergo the intransference yourself
4575,yes an unknown experiment and youre not the type of man to allow others to take risks
4576,its all very simple you wanted my intellect you got it and along with it you received a little conscience
4577,yes yes you see jano is now saddled with the sense of right and wrong which makes him an explosive element in a civilisation such as his
4578,jano has another plan
4579,i think its like mine
4580,we must take that chance
4581,you know my dear theres something very satisfying in destroying something thats evil dont you think
4582,jano since you have destroyed the power you held over chal and his people you realise now of course youve got to learn to live together
4583,i see but in my case im afraid that is utterly impossible
4584,a great honour dear boy
4585,just think of the challenge to be able to set up the people of this planet for a new life youre quite ready for this task
4586,yes i do and youre the only man who can my boy
4587,thank you jano and if ever you need the benefit of my wisdom again i trust and hope you will allow me to express myself with my own free will rather than place me in an oven and try and cook it out of me
4588,well i must say young man im very proud of you
4589,goodbye steven and good luck
4590,well who knows my dear in this strange complex of time and space anything can happen come along little one we must go we mustnt look back     ltback to the episode listing
4591,oh when youve seen the ages that ive see you wont use that term quite so freely anyway i dont think its been all that long
4592,oh well you see the problem is coming back to the twentieth century my dear the tardis im afraid is often mistaken for the real police box
4593,yes and fortunately he cant get in
4594,so thats it
4595,isnt that interesting very interesting
4596,you know theres something alien about that tower i can sense it
4597,i can feel its got something sort of powerful its look at my skin look at that ive got that pricking sensation again the same just as i had when i saw the daleks those daleks were near
4598,oh er yes of course you er you didnt meet them did you child no no and i pray that you never will i really must investigate it
4599,well hardly a specialist sir but i dabble yes i dabble oh so thats what it is
4600,yes you know i had a very strong sense of energy outside this building a sort of magnetic pull if you like it was most unusual so i presume thats what it must have been
4601,most ingenious
4602,is that so
4603,oh ah my secretary dodo chaplet
4604,oh tonight sir
4605,oh yes yes yes yes of course my dear fellow yes eh dodo
4606,you call what
4607,oh yes yes quite so
4608,are you seriously telling me sir that you have invented a machine that can think
4609,and never makes mistakes
4610,i take it that i speak into here
4611,er what is the square route of 17422
4612,one moment please 131 point 993 yes thats near enough yes its truly remarkable
4613,well what did it say my dear
4614,good heavens let me see well now how would it know that
4615,dodo
4616,whats the matter my dear are you all right
4617,oh just sit down a moment
4618,i see and that of course is the programme regimentator
4619,yes i wonder
4620,yes i am sir charles
4621,yes very odd very odd indeed perhaps hes overworking who was that little man krimpton
4622,i wonder i wonder

4650,yes three oclock that must have been after we left him
4651,no we met last night or rather early this morning we used his taxi which he left in covent garden
4652,oh yes it is possible of course
4653,oh i dont know sir charles i dont know
4654,oh yes whats this then
4655,oh yes i see yes theres no reason given at all is there
4656,yes i wonder sir charles do you suppose er no i dont suppose you would

4659,oh there she is child perhaps youd better ask her yourself
4660,no child no youre right on time well im sorry sir charles i cant help you with your problem but im afraid im rather out of touch
4661,oh but my dear i thought you were going to show me round london this morning
4662,oh thats very nice of you yes very understanding
4663,ah i think perhaps id better phone his office first
4664,do you mind if i use the phone
4665,thank you
4666,oh no no no
4667,no just water
4668,what happened
4669,oh what are you talking about child
4670,what were you saying my dear
4671,yes yes i think i remember i was speaking to professor brett and all of a sudden there seemed to be an explosion it very nearly knocked me off my feet it was as if as if
4672,it was if something enormous and terrific was trying to absorb me yes yes yes oh its ridiculous child isnt it yes yes yes theres something erratically wrong with that telephone yes it was just like an electric shock
4673,from whom my dear
4674,yes yes thank you
4675,thats it either that telephone is dangerously out of order or
4676,stay where you are my dear
4677,theres a new and deadly danger facing us yes and its coming from professor bretts office
4678,none of us do yet come here my dear look at me yes its just as i thought shes been hypnotised sit in that chair my dear
4679,i resist all attempts to change me into somebody else
4680,now im going to start counting and when ive counted up to five you will be fast asleep and when you wake again you will forget all about this distressing incident now im going to start counting just look at that ring on my hand
4681,oh yes shes all right
4682,yes its a very fine thing yes and take care of her wont you
4683,i dont know she said something about strategic points in london
4684,where i wonder where
4685,oh ben how did you know i was here
4686,didnt she keep that appointment
4687,oh dear me its just as i feared
4688,oh shes a little under the weather and shes gone into the country for a few days
4689,oh shell be quite all right yes really im rather worried about polly she appears to be missing that child
4690,no i think its far more serious than that that tramp in the paper did you see it
4691,well im not so sure that it does my boy thats why i want to solicit your help in this matter i think er i dont think you will arouse so much suspicion as the police might
4692,well i want you to investigate in and around that neighbourhood where we were last night in that club
4693,yes and be careful my boy this might be dangerous
4694,oh dear dear dear dear dear
4695,oh yes that boy that boy should be back here ages ago
4696,well he seemed quite a responsible young lad i suppose if he hasnt phoned its because he hasnt been er well he has not been able to
4697,no sir charles i dont think we should allow the police to intervene at the moment otherwise we might drive this threat further underground or wherever it is
4698,well unless im very much mistaken were going to have a lot more than rumour to contend with oh dear me where is that boy
4699,well i cant wait any longer i must take a look for myself
4700,after what happened to dodo my dear sir we should never have let those youngsters out of our sight
4701,ah come in my dear good heavens
4702,now take your time take your time now wheres polly
4703,what do you mean theyve got her where is she
4704,where
4705,well im afraid i do
4706,yes i had suspected something of that sort
4707,oh my dear sir charles how could you know that
4708,we are not wasting time my dear boy we need sir charles authority his help without this we can do nothing
4709,i am quite prepared to accept the truth of this boys statement
4710,no sir charles i think the police might find it too big for them to handle at the moment
4711,and you say that they were obeying this machine
4712,im afraid weve got all our priorities mixed up they might be able to destroy this machine but in all probability there are others waiting to attack us
4713,exactly and we dont know their location and i doubt very much if we can find them all by tomorrow noon no i think we should strike at what i believe to be the centre of this menace wotan
4714,well i fear weve riled him my boy you see the official mind can only take in so much at a time however we must keep our weather eyes open come along
4715,what is happening sir charles
4716,and what is in there
4717,wait my boy  wm3 goes past the doctor then turns its back on the army and just sits there    news is being given on the television behind the bar the newsreader is  kenneth kendall
4718,its remarkable truly remarkable
4719,oh how do you do sir
4720,oh yes this is all very simple this is a computer and this computer hasnt been completely programmed
4721,exactly and my guess is this was put into action before it was ready sir
4722,well i hope that were just as lucky next time gentlemen let me have that screwdriver young man
4723,oh dont worry my boy shell be back
4724,my dear young man i havent the time to discuss polly at the moment if im going to analyse this mechanism ive got a great deal to do now oh dear im so hot wait a minute let me take this cloak off here now hold onto that and dont drag it on the floor theres a good boy
4725,well yes i think ive managed to decode the programme mechanism and if im right i think there are eleven others in london perhaps in an area of twenty to thirty miles and this has its own timing device this computer and i think if my calculations are right then we conclude that they were intended to attack at twelve oclock today
4726,just a moment sir please major green
4727,yes of course do you remember me major green
4728,yes i think youll have to have him removed gentlemen he may need medical attention
4729,yes
4730,oh of course he is he remembers nothing since he was taken over by bretts computer system
4731,yes i am
4732,what do you intend to do there sir
4733,that is very dangerous sir charles and if i may say so your strong arm methods have already got us into plenty of trouble
4734,my dear boy if we worry about one person we shall never solve anything shall we
4735,somehow weve got to get a hold of that machine
4736,yes and i think our only one chance is to paralyse the nervous system of that mechanism yes and if i remember rightly it will be electromagnetically controlled yes in other words gentlemen weve got to capture it
4737,i shall need equipment sir charles sufficient equipment to set up a powerful magnetic field and it must operate effectively within say twenty feet
4738,well im afraid that we have no choice gentlemen
4739,well now where was it reported last
4740,now just a moment sir charles now look if you close that road there this and this then we can funnel it into here and there gentlemen we can spring our trap
4741,oh well allow me to illustrate sir charles now to set up a magnetic field i want a four square box formed by four cables
4742,well exactly therefore we must prepare these three first and then when the machine has approached and appeared in that position we connect the fourth cable and switch on
4743,i shall connect the cable myself
4744,that is a risk we have to take
4745,i beg your pardon young man
4746,i shall allow it to come within twenty feet so dont be alarmed my friend
4747,not yet not yet
4748,now
4749,i want you to remain up here sir charles until i give the signal
4750,ah temper temper
4751,well to coin a phrase sir charles i neutralised it quite a harmless looking fellow dont you think we must find a way to get it down to covent garden
4752,well i think thats about all gentlemen
4753,ive made an important readjustment to aid and change the purpose of this machine
4754,well you could say that of course yes i hope it will carry out a special programme that ive fed into it
4755,well my dear sir charles we can soon find that out cant we would you mind just standing back for a moment now my dear ben just carry out what ive asked you to do
4756,well it all started at that tower
4757,yes in bretts office and i think it will probably end there
4758,well im afraid we cant check up on that now my boy my machine has to face wotan before noon
4759,no no no you cant you wont be able oh you foolish boy
4760,well it will be like the crossing of two electrical currents my machine has to face up to bretts computer wotan
4761,well those people that have been under some form of hypnosis will return to their normal selves
4762,theres nothing you can do for the poor fellow
4763,all immobilised sir charles waiting for orders orders that will never come
4764,there you are my child its nice to see you so well again and you my boy away from that wretched tower
4765,oh yes ive been waiting around here for her where is she i very nearly left without her
4766,yes er to the airport yes she is well i hope
4767,her love oh theres gratitude for you take her all the way around the world through space and time and then
4768,er what i er nothing my dear boy nothing now i think you both want to get away dont you thank you polly very much thank you ben
4769,goodbye run along enjoy yourselves yes
4770,what are you both doing in here
4771,how dare you follow me into the tardis
4772,the tardis sir this is a vessel for travelling through time and space why did you follow me
4773,and stand back from those controls those controls are used for dematerialising
4774,you and this young lady are experiencing it you are now travelling through time and space
4775,young man its going to be a long time before you see your ship again
4776,i dont know thats the cause of half my troubles through my journeys i never know
4777,i have no control over where i land neither can i choose the period in which i land in oh now you see that scanner that is what i call a scanner up there we get a very good view of the outside
4778,wait wait wait young man we dont know where we are we dont know if its safe or what period were in
4779,yes i think its quite normal yes the temperatures all right well i think you can leave but watch your step
4780,oh dear all this distraction and i really thought i was going to be alone again
4781,i never leave it unlocked my boy
4782,im not going to take you back to london in the tardis
4783,my dear young man
4784,well i suppose i shall have to chase after them quite incapable of looking after themselves
4785,yes i wonder yes i wonder
4786,oh yes yes you may know where you are my dears but not when oh i can foresee oodles of trouble
4787,we cant be too sure my boy
4788,oh good gracious most of them have been standing there for centuries
4789,oh talk on the train child
4790,well there doesnt seem to appear any victorian restoration i think it could be any time after the 16th century
4791,well i dont think so somehow
4792,well we stopped aside sir on our journey to walk along the cliffs and unfortunately we got lost
4793,no no we dont come from this part of the country
4794,no just the three of us you see we are travellers looking for shelter
4795,no sir not by sea
4796,thank you
4797,yes im afraid youre going to lose your bet young man that gentleman comes from the seventeenth century
4798,no we dont touch it i wonder if you could direct us to the nearest inn we seek shelter
4799,no i dont think weve met before no
4800,ah ben ben ben no sir we met nobody and saw nothing are you er expecting some friends
4801,avery

4807,ah yes of course i remember now yes yes yes we have to wait until the tide recedes

4814,yes
4815,thank you thank you indeed and i think thats going to be all right now yes goodbye sir goodbye come along
4816,youre the landlord i presume hmm
4817,oh we only want rooms for the night my friend
4818,yes
4819,the churchwarden said you could probably put us up for the night but it appears that he was wrong
4820,longfoot sir joseph longfoot now surely that name means something to you
4821,granted granted now rooms a meal something hot for us surely thats possible
4822,ah yes yes indeed yes for the lads and i think i shall be able to dry myself out with that lovely fire
4823,yes well i think it better at the moment my dear what would they say to a maiden in trousers
4824,watch your tongue dear boy
4825,oh we shall return to the tardis my boy when the tide recedes and lets hope that we materialize in nineteen sixty six
4826,no im afraid im not my dear more likely we shall probably land in the far distant future
4827,yes i think theyre somewhat suspicious of us
4828,well i wouldnt worry too much about that my dear because i dont think were going to be here long enough to find that out
4829,i think we would do well to remember the churchwardens words
4830,to keep our thoughts only on ourselves
4831,i beg your pardon sir
4832,i dont think ive set eyes on you before in my life man
4833,and what do you mean
4834,yes he merely tried to help us barely an acquaintance
4835,and how do you know all this sir
4836,dont harm them
4837,and where are you taking me
4838,i demand
4839,i do not know this holy joe that you keep referring to
4840,he was a member of your crew
4841,avery
4842,of course of course avery the pirate i should have known
4843,i would prefer you to use the correct term sir i am a doctor
4844,you vicious fellow get him off my back
4845,oh i find your friend rather a bore but you i think a gentleman so let us talk like gentlemen
4846,well its quite obvious to the perceptive eye sir your dress your manner your taste yes youre the type of man that has raised himself to an exalted position unaided hmm hmm
4847,oh quite so quite so but you are neither a barbarian or a savage i can see that
4848,my dear sir im sure you can quickly see through any flattery of mine
4849,so let us talk like men of the world be elegant and with dignity
4850,may i sit down
4851,thank you my man
4852,thank you no that would indeed be pleasant
4853,one thing more before we go on any further
4854,now that we understand each other i think it would only be fair that if i impart the information you require i should receive some small reward
4855,in fact a share
4856,yes indeed yes after all my dear captain thank you there is quite enough to go round is there not
4857,well heres to a better acquaintance mmm oh yes indeed yes a very fine old madeira yes indicative of your general taste sir if i may say so
4858,tell me about my friends
4859,why is there trouble
4860,oh good gracious we must escape from here and try and help them
4861,but i dont understand you
4862,oh yes i quite agree a somewhat violent man
4863,oh because he thought that i held the secret of the treasure belonging to the deceased pirate avery
4864,oh yes hes determined to get it apparently the churchwarden knew something about it
4865,but the officers of the law
4866,yes yes i think i agree yes well bear with me sir i have a plan
4867,now sir i hope this works you may pick up any five cards
4868,do you wish me to tell you
4869,ah such brave words my friend brave words but these cards hold the secret to your life or death
4870,do not mock that which you do not understand
4871,very well my friend very well be it on your own head
4872,yes yes yes thats very strange and very disturbing
4873,well im afraid theyre rather unpleasant yes the first one represents yourself innkeeper
4874,well the cards have it so sir
4875,the third is the king the blackest villain of them all
4876,yes and that is death itself
4877,well im afraid i have no idea about that sir but i can assure you he will triumph in the end
4878,well you may call it what you wish i know its only cards but sometimes they tell the truth
4879,oh yes indeed yes yes arent you afraid
4880,very well then my friend shuffle for yourself and lets see them reveal your own fate
4881,yes perhaps perhaps yes
4882,no time for idle speculation we have to get away from this boat as soon as we can
4883,yes its our only chance
4884,yes and weve got to hurry if im to help my friends
4885,yes because he has them prisoner
4886,yes i think youre quite right yes its better to have the law on our side isnt it
4887,yes well i hope your fortune turns out all right my friend
4888,yes and why not here my dear
4889,oh my dear child my dear child control yourself let it suffice that i did escape in the company of kewper you remember the innkeeper
4890,yes thats right yes yes
4891,pike intends to sack the old church and at the same time search for averys treasure
4892,well i cant be exact sir but pretty soon i should say tonight or tomorrow night
4893,yes especially if as kewper thinks that the village will be pillaged and burnt too
4894,yes at least the smugglers will have prior knowledge of pikes plan now that kewper has escaped
4895,yes be off with you sir
4896,oh my child explain yourself
4897,oh yes you mean that place where the revenue man came out of
4898,yes
4899,well im afraid my boy we cant leave at the moment
4900,yes well i know its really difficult for both you to understand but im under moral obligation
4901,no but its this village i feel that i might be responsible for its destruction and therefore i must at least try and avoid this danger until blake comes back
4902,ah wouldnt we my dear
4903,well you seem to forget young man that ive already met pike and i know something that he doesnt the clue to the treasure
4904,well i think if we are able to find that treasure first we might be able to bargain
4905,yes and its going to give us enough time for blake to come back here and the same time to save the people in this village
4906,well said my boy now lets get down to the church and hope that our luck still holds out come on come on
4907,oh for heavens sake boy some kind of code and im trying to work it out
4908,no no before these names yes yes thats it
4909,yes of course dead mans secret
4910,yes yes of course thats the answer to the puzzle yes all these dead people
4911,no no not here
4912,yes my dear exactly good heavens well you are inspired come on quickly
4913,it was some kind of rhyme now let me see dead mans secret key ringwood smallbeer and gurney
4914,well we must find these names mustnt we yes thatll be the first step
4915,oh yes of course dear boy well where is it where is it
4916,yes oh thats very clever yes very clever indeed yes now just shut it up again will you then we can get on
4917,oh good my dear well continue with the search and then the sooner well have better you know the sooner we find the secret
4918,ah ha ha ha ha ha yes
4919,yes of course yes it would help if we found four names
4920,yes exactly yes exactly
4921,well my dear
4922,and what are you doing here sir
4923,and what name might yours be
4924,for what purpose
4925,i hope you dont expect me to help you
4926,here now be careful sir
4927,by stabbing your man in the back sir you had us all at your mercy there was no need for you to kill kewper
4928,what is it you want of us
4929,and suppose we refuse to tell you
4930,im not going to barter with you sir where is your captain
4931,he would at least listen
4932,leave this to me ben my boy
4933,have some mercy
4934,we must play for time now trust me
4935,well i must admit the churchwarden did tell me something but to be quite honest with you i am baffled
4936,the dead mans secret key er ringwood smallbeer and gurney were these names of villages around here
4937,and gurney what of he
4938,good men i take it
4939,nothing im afraid nothing
4940,now dont be hasty please i said i needed your help now this is how
4941,yes get polly back to the tardis and i will follow immediately blake returns with the men
4942,there is no other way child without either of you they cant hold a hostage for me to force my hand
4943,ah ive done it before my dear boy we must play for time
4944,quickly quickly i somehow dont think that master cherub will be the winner
4945,yes yes
4946,i think we agreed on that point previously
4947,my dear captain i had every intention of telling you
4948,i had no choice my friends are in danger
4949,stop i made a bargain with you sir gave you my word dont you want me to keep it
4950,i wish to keep my side of the bargain but i want to change the terms of my plan that is if i may
4951,i would rather not touch it
4952,i have given you all my reasons i want no part of the gold though perhaps i can deliver it to you immediately
4953,there is no need for innocent people to suffer
4954,senseless destruction
4955,prove it
4956,i suppose we must trust you
4957,have no fear captain i am not likely to try and cheat you just as he did
4958,now let me see the churchwarden set me a riddle which involved four names ringwood smallbeer gurney and deadman which should be on that wall sir
4959,ha yes its there just there
4960,the original names were changed by the churchwarden
4961,yes that is correct and unless i am very much mistaken sir this flagstone is at the intersection of those fateful names
4962,indeed i think that is what you seek
4963,well how deep is it
4964,no i must try and help the squire
4965,oh a little exhausted my dear otherwise im all right come along lets get off
4966,yes superstition is a strange thing my dear but sometimes it tells the truth
4967,i have no idea i have no control over such matters
4968,my dear boy it could be a great deal worse
4969,just look up at that scanner we have arrived at the coldest place in the world  ltback to the episode listing
4970,quite an arctic storm blowing out there come along polly my child with my cloak
4971,yes well im glad you approve my child
4972,oh now now now stop being so flippant we dont know what were in for outside there now come along come along come along
4973,oh like toast my dear now did you find everything you want
4974,all right well lets go outside and investigate go along
4975,please stop that please please stop that
4976,can you tell us precisely where we are please
4977,doctor
4978,why dont you speak up im deaf  whos the co
4979,we dont intend you any harm general i can assure you of that
4980,i dont like your tone sir
4981,well i dont want to depress you both but im afraid were not quite where you think we are
4982,well just take a peek at that
4983,yes i see a rocket testing site
4984,here we are well now excuse me my dear take this to your general please
4985,very well then take me to the general i think perhaps i can help him
4986,now look here sergeant this is urgent i insist
4987,i think i know what you are going to see
4988,ive written down here what he will see now take your hands off me please
4989,well im not quite sure sir let me have another look into this instrument  dyson
4990,general general yes its just as i thought come and have a look at these land masses
4991,now doesnt that remind you of anything
4992,and now my dear doctor barclay i suggest you look at that piece of paper i gave you
4993,certainly
4994,yes sir im sorry im afraid i can you see millions of years ago there was a twin planet to earth and
4995,am i my dear yes im afraid i am rather worried
4996,well you see ben i know what this planet is and what it means to earth
4997,well that pretty soon we shall be having visitors
4998,oh quiet boy quiet
4999,yes well im afraid all thats going to be rather difficult
5000,hot seat
5001,well i think if you allowed us to return where we came from
5002,i can only repeat sir what i have already told you you will get visitors from that other planet
5003,yes they must bring them down
5004,because they cant last another orbit
5005,you will you pay attention will you
5006,hey
5007,hmm
5008,well how can we do that boy
5009,nonsense nonsense theyll burn us down in a flash
5010,no ben
5011,terrible terrible
5012,im afraid the spaceship exploded my dear
5013,save us
5014,gather energy
5015,and how are you going to stop this energy drain from mondas
5016,how are we going to survive
5017,his age is unimportant here
5018,you cannot for one moment
5019,emotions love pride hate fear have you no emotions sir
5020,why why
5021,i dont think you should have done that general we may have learned a very great deal
5022,i think you rather underestimate the cybermen general
5023,no need im here
5024,yes yes yes your plan is foiled sir you cannot fire the rocket
5025,i must protest
5026,oh im not sure my dear comes from an outside influence unless this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin
5027,oh dont worry child dont worry dont worry oh lets have a look dear boy
5028,it cannot absorb much more energy
5029,general
5030,we owe you our lives that man was going to have us shot
5031,that is so we prevented it being fired at you we helped you therefore i suggest you help us
5032,your planet is finished it will disintegrate we know why you came here so why not stay and live with us in peace
5033,we have no chance we must play for time be quiet well sir what have you decided
5034,a moment please are you able to disarm this rocket
5035,it will give us the time we need
5036,yes now quiet we accept your terms the warhead will be removed from the rocket
5037,you must do as they say
5038,let me handle this my boy
5039,all of you go with barclay
5040,go i think it is wiser
5041,you give me your word that this young girl will be returned to me when that bomb is safely stowed away
5042,very well child off you go and dont forget your coat i dont want you to get cold
5043,didnt you hear  woman
5044,i do not understand your friend sir evacuate surely youre not going to return to mondas now
5045,what is your second objective its quite obvious isnt it the destruction of the earth ben barclay do not help them    doctor
5046,well gentlemen stalemate i think dont you agree well now what about a little talk
5047,oh quite so but im afraid that wont help save your planet will it     krang
5048,you will regret this
5049,what is it child
5050,no no wait the vibrations perhaps its coming from mondas
5051,this spacecraft receives its energy from mondas perhaps its absorbing too much
5052,no i dont know child it is an unknown power
5053,what did you say my boy its all over its all over thats what you said no but it isnt all over its far from being all over
5054,i must get back to the tardis immediately
5055,yes i must go now
5056,no no i must go at once
5057,ah yes thank you its good keep warm
5058,stop stop concentrate on one thing one thing
5059,the muscles are still a bit tight
5060,hold that
5061,put it down put it down
5062,ah the crusades from saladin the doctor was a great collector wasnt he
5063,oh i dont look like him
5064,dont you know
5065,id like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after its spread its wings
5066,life depends on change and renewal
5067,ive been renewed have i thats it ive been renewed its part of the tardis without it i couldnt survive come here
5068,i thought so i wonder where i wonder where
5069,i think i think we must have landed for sometime i think its time we went for a stroll
5070,oxygen density 172 radiation nil temperature 86 strong suggestion of mercury deposits satisfied ben now are you two coming or are you not
5071,are you coming you two
5072,earth examiner accord every access vulcan
5073,if earth didnt warn you we were coming governor they must have had a very good reason i wonder what it was
5074,i am the examiner
5075,to examine and i intend to start my examination at once
5076,your turn now governor
5077,please go on
5078,interesting continue
5079,i shall examine the capsule later you may leave us
5080,we are wearing proper clothes
5081,yes very rude of me wasnt it terrible manners to tell you the truth i was studying his reaction seeing if he agreed with the story
5082,must have a look at that capsule
5083,our answers must come from that mercury swamp
5084,when bragen found us he definitely said space capsule
5085,where did you get this
5086,dropped
5087,extermination
5088,a laser why not it shouldnt be too difficult
5089,not really this is just an entry bay isnt it
5090,i think well leave if for tonight
5091,that is my decision governor
5092,a hundred years you say this has been buried
5093,it didnt come from this planet vulcan
5094,alien yes very alien goodnight
5095,polly ben come in and meet the daleks
5096,the daleks
5097,these two pieces of metal are identical the doctor got one of them from the daleks himself
5098,i knew i should find them here i knew it
5099,nothing human no
5100,there were three daleks in here whats happened to the other one
5101,quickly ben quickly
5102,no no theres nothing
5103,ah ha excellent good thinking good thinking
5104,perhaps hes been experimenting on the daleks ah
5105,this light is dead now the watch
5106,now lestersons fanatic the governors jealous of his own position what does that suggest to you dont know havent thought about it but all is not well with this colony add to that one dalek
5107,yes all that is needed to wipe out this entire colony
5108,real doctor oh you mean the real doctor
5109,save my breath would lesterson listen lesterson listen lesterson listen lesterson listen exercises the tongue try it lesterson listen lesterson listen lesterson listen
5110,listen listen
5111,read this aloud
5112,exactly it doesnt say except your laboratory anywhere does it unless its in microprint
5113,what was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule
5114,you were astounded
5115,amazed
5116,you didnt even give them a glance why because youd been in there and seen them where is the third dalek
5117,you opened up the capsule without permission you found the inner compartment containing three daleks you took one of them away and you hid it
5118,these lumps of metal daleks i want them broken up or melted down up or down i dont care which but destroyed
5119,im an earth examiner i demand it
5120,perhaps we should ask the governor about that i wish to see him immediately
5121,but not impossible ben polly
5122,which is why i have a badge which says so
5123,if there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards ah ha fruit
5124,nuts yes certainly here we are crackers
5125,china yes i went there once i believe met marco polo
5126,yes marco polo a friend i believe he was
5127,shh
5128,i never talk nonsense
5129,well hardly never
5130,at first i thought there might be more than one
5131,oh yes yes of course lets consider this button for a moment its the only clue weve got to the murderer of the examiner the real examiner
5132,have you what about the daleks
5133,i can and thats why we have to stay
5134,i know the misery they cause the destruction but theres something else more terrible something i can only half remember
5135,well where is the governor what did he say
5136,excuse me
5137,to see the governor of course
5138,very well
5139,i shall radio earth governor or not hensell will have to listen to them ill get earth to back me
5140,i know youre there
5141,i found the operator unconscious
5142,the cables have been cut
5143,bragen i was attacked just after i landed this is a small souvenir i collected
5144,i call them what they are daleks
5145,i do
5146,lesterson what have you done what have you done
5147,the fools the stupid fools
5148,nothing yet
5149,it knew who i was
5150,yes it will end the colonys problems because it will end the colony
5151,it can do many things lesterson but the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings it destroys them without mercy without conscience it destroys them utterly completely it destroys them
5152,i shall stop you i will
5153,permission permission for what
5154,but but didnt you all hear what i said the daleks must be destroyed
5155,very well if not by my order then by earths come ben polly
5156,but ive told you i realise i cant give you any proof but youve no idea of the danger
5157,yes danger i shall be contacting earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored
5158,very well immobilise yourself go on i order it immediately
5159,wire scissors tape
5160,ah congratulations ben
5161,you just used your brains thats what you did the daleks are the most important thing
5162,so do i excellent excellent
5163,if only we could find a ah yes
5164,now were really getting somewhere
5165,they think that lestersons the driving force but i dont the daleks are using him
5166,problem smash the daleks and the people here will lock us up or kill us let the daleks go and well all be exterminated
5167,oh yes its coming on
5168,mustnt underestimate any of them lestersons a first class scientist first class he opened the capsule he realised that the daleks could be reactivated
5169,there we are
5170,what is it it could be the answer to all our problems
5171,well help him polly but later
5172,now this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter what we want is in lestersons laboratory come along
5173,may i come in
5174,oh just to see how youre getting on
5175,no please im not here to cause trouble im just interested thats all
5176,well i did give you permission to open up the capsule now didnt i oh please carry on
5177,stop you no of course not we got off on the wrong foot lesterson but im a reasonable man and ive been thinking perhaps i was hasty
5178,a truce my dear fellow id like to be friends
5179,oh thank you thank you
5180,oh splendid splendid please please carry on
5181,im saving your life
5182,ben if you were a dalek what would be your next move
5183,oh no no no no shes a clever girl but she couldnt answer this
5184,oh no no no
5185,no no no shes looking around theres a lot to see in the colony shes interested i like that
5186,where are we going
5187,hmm power
5188,now the energy intake for daleks should be the cube
5189,oh its useless with incomplete data
5190,he just went past that means we can get into his laboratory again
5191,oh come along ben come along
5192,stand aside servants shouldnt question
5193,not for me it isnt accord every access ive got a badge
5194,a dalek order short circuit the generator ben
5195,dont be frightened of it ben its not armed im going to see what it was doing in there
5196,lets get out of here
5197,yes when i say run run like a rabbit run
5198,but if you didnt do it lesterson then the dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself
5199,but ive already explained to you
5200,but they must be destroyed
5201,huh
5202,greed and ambition thats all it is wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them
5203,what is that to do with me
5204,just exactly what do you mean by that
5205,theres only one possible way that you could know im not the examiner
5206,exactly ben exactly only two people knew of his arrival on this planet myself and his murderer
5207,then why dont you arrest us because theres a doubt isnt there because it might it just might go against you
5208,oh id rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one dalek
5209,intrusion its no intrusion were just returning the various calls that you made this guard tried to tell us you were busy youre not a bit are you
5210,oh what a nice new uniform very smart very smart i would like a hat like that
5211,yes
5212,so theyve given you the run of the colony have they
5213,uh uh examiner i wonder how much longer theyll be able to move around on these floors
5214,the floors theyre not metal
5215,static do you see they need a constant supply of static from the floor some sort of electrical field
5216,its madness
5217,letting them run around like this
5218,one dalek in bragens office three daleks just gone down the corridors that makes four
5219,well lesterson cant have been making them perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought
5220,it looks like a perfectly ordinary notice board to me
5221,accord every access remember
5222,lesterson
5223,you havent been building daleks have you
5224,and there were only three in the capsule
5225,well weve just seen four one in the governors office and three in the corridor
5226,theres only one explanation the daleks are reproducing themselves
5227,machines what makes you think theyre just machines the daleks are brilliant engineers nothing is beyond them given the right materials
5228,i said nothing is beyond them given the right materials
5229,lesterson whats the matter
5230,ben ive found a message in code its an anagram you just take the capital letters see work it out yourself
5231,meeting tonight 2000 hours r o c k e t  rocket r o o m  room p rocket room p
5232,whats the time
5233,yes
5234,bragen
5235,no doubt you want to be leader of the daleks too
5236,well see if you can stop this one from killing me
5237,you hope to have it both ways bragen but how will you look in front of the governor when i explain your dual role to him
5238,an impostor how do you propose to prove that
5239,the one you murdered
5240,murders a far worse crime than impersonation
5241,hmm works by sound does it
5242,oh im sorry
5243,well your imprisonment hasnt been entirely wasted its brought your enemy out into the open
5244,yes but did you know that he was the leader of the rebels
5245,yes its quite a simple sort of lock really
5246,but even if he knew of the danger could he do anything the rebels are well organised
5247,in that case we must get word to him
5248,ah yes but then im not the real examiner
5249,we arent going to have that chance unless we can get out of here
5250,i wonder how theyre converting the power
5251,the daleks theyre powered by static electricity its like blood to them a constant lifestream
5252,it is to the daleks theyve conquered static just as theyve conquered antimagnetics
5253,i dont seem to be able to hit the right note do you have any more water
5254,then i shall have to get some
5255,yes
5256,i say i say do you think we might have a little more water
5257,wait a minute
5258,an electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity i wonder how much longer weve got    doctor
5259,well done who was the man who went outside just now
5260,on their static power supply
5261,yes i know he ran away so that i could oh well its a long story but dont worry that boy can take care of himself

5275,the window does it open
5276,it had better or were done for out you go
5277,the daleks theyre teeming all over the corridors weve got to get back to lestersons lab

5320,wait wait
5321,im glad youve come sergeant i was waiting for an escort
5322,civil tongue sergeant you are in charge of these men
5323,a gentleman at last doctor von wer at your service
5324,thats what i said
5325,german from hanover where your good king george comes from and i speak english a good deal better than he does
5326,didnt i tell you i was
5327,what a great devotion to duty your lieutenant shows sergeant
5328,you think he will catch them
5329,disrespect to your superior officer sergeant i could report you
5330,ah but at a price sergeant
5331,ah yes
5332,article seventeen aliens act 1730
5333,you are gentlemen of the law
5334,then you are doubtless familiar with article seventeen you cannot hang a citizen of a foreign power without first informing his ambassador
5335,german and i know more about the english law than you do it seems
5336,with proper care yes
5337,what will happen to us
5338,im glad we did im just beginning to enjoy myself down with king george

5346,well youre a loyal jacobite arent you this is your tune come on everybody join in
5347,thank heavens did you hear that tune
5348,they were singing it to drive me out of my mind as im a loyal subject to king george the second
5349,they know of a plot to murder your general the duke of cumberland
5350,take me to solicitor grey perhaps were in time to prevent it
5351,well its only just discovered that rogue is party to it
5352,auf wiedersehen
5353,there is no plot
5354,would the chance to lay your hands on 15000 pounds be a waste of your time
5355,the personal standard of prince charles edward
5356,whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the councils of the prince you would agree he would also know where the prince was most likely to run to
5357,that must remain my secret for the time being
5358,but why employ them since we are both on the same side the 30000 pounds reward for the capture of the prince is surely enough to satisfy both of us
5359,i am on the track of some but i need a free hand
5360,just keep very still
5361,its so swollen does it hurt you
5362,say ahh
5363,ahh

5400,hmm
5401,hmm
5402,no
5403,well its just a wee idea really

5405,thats a fortune in these days now we want weapons lots of them and a rowing boat
5406,good and we can buy the weapons
5407,from the english soldiers well theyre bound to have heaps of weapons as souvenirs
5408,you dont know the english soldier hed sell his grandmother for tuppence hapenny
5409,we smuggle them aboard the annabelle

5516,well its small plants and animals from the sea
5517,youd better get used to it i dont expect theres much else to be had around here visitors
5518,and she had a message about us for you
5519,and just what part are we to play in this festival of the vernal equinox
5520,no wait i have something important to say
5521,i wont speak under threats
5522,what will happen to them
5523,youll have to go polly
5524,what i have to say concerns a certain professor zaroff
5525,a great deal hes here isnt he
5526,the food it couldnt be anyone else but zaroff he led the field in producing food from the sea his progress is astonishing
5527,just send him this message and youll see
5528,youre making a big mistake
5529,ara take this message to professor zaroff
5530,hold on hold on for your lives
5531,dont move dont even breathe
5532,first release my friends
5533,but i do professor zaroff if anything happens to them youll never know the secret i was going to tell you
5534,first let me say how glad i am to see that the reports of your death twenty years previously are a little premature
5535,the east blamed the west the west the east
5536,now here you are the greatest scientific genius since leonardo under the sea you must have a fantastic story to tell
5537,i havent got one
5538,but im sure a that great man like you wouldnt want a modern scientific brain like mine to be sacrificed to a heathen idol
5539,yes
5540,yes
5541,i come with you
5542,ancient temples under the sea but thats not possible thats only a legend
5543,were on the ancient kingdom of atlantis
5544,but how did you get them to accept you surely science is in opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship
5545,what is it ara
5546,fish operation well well well ara do you know where the main fuses are
5547,oh never mind go back to polly and if the chance comes get her away from there will you do that for me
5548,no not a bit not a bit
5549,i expected nothing less from the great professor zaroff
5550,i cant think of how i came to be so clumsy i must have bumped into it
5551,as your prisoner
5552,professor you have offered these people a very big sugarcoated pill to make them accept you yes
5553,the dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be
5554,exactly but now how are you going to do it even a genius like you
5555,a very large mass to lift
5556,yes may i
5557,yes but you havent got a drain big enough to take an ocean
5558,youll forgive me im a little lost the crust of the earth is more than a hundred miles thick below that is believed to be a whitehot molten core now where is your ocean going to go
5559,oh now youre making fun of me professor
5560,even supposing you could drill to the depth of a hundred miles
5561,its still an enormous obstacle
5562,even if
5563,but professor
5564,even supposing you succeeded you know what will happen dont you
5565,well the water will be converted into superheated steam the pressure will grow and crack the crust of the earth destroy all life maybe even blow the planet apart
5566,yes
5567,yes just one small question why do you want to blow up the world
5568,ah mister damon youre back did your operation go well
5569,oh dear how very frustrating for you
5570,oh yes yes of course you will
5571,amazing the professor leads the field in scientific discoveries what a fantastic conception to control the world from a test tube
5572,well two can play at that game have you ever seen this
5573,ara no wait ara its me
5574,wheres polly
5575,good girl well done ara where can i find your chief of state
5576,i want to talk to him can you take me to him
5577,ill have to take that risk  damon
5578,can you get damon away i want to talk to the priest alone
5579,can i have a word with you ramo
5580,were both on the same side ramo you distrust zaroff out of instinct i distrust him because i know the truth
5581,thats a very good question i wish i could think of a good answer
5582,can we talk here
5583,he says that hes going to raise atlantis yes thats not quite true he intends to destroy atlantis
5584,its easier than raising it
5585,he intends to drill a hole through the earths crust and drain away the ocean yes
5586,have you any idea what will happen if he does that ill show you
5587,this pot is zaroffs project watch now the pot begins to boil but the steam cant get out and so i think wed better stand a little further back get down
5588,well i thought i might mention it of course if you dont mind being blown up
5589,could i i am not the ruler of atlantis
5590,i might
5591,could i
5592,how do i look
5593,never mind     jamie
5594,a man of science
5595,oh no no i wouldnt do that if i were you in fact i wanted to speak to you alone excellency
5596,excellency the professor is a wonderful man
5597,a worker of miracles
5598,but have you noticed his eyes lately
5599,when he talks of his project have you noticed his eyes they light up like this
5600,the professor is as mad as a hatter
5601,completely no answer its sad
5602,so you will not listen to us
5603,weve only just begun
5604,you disappoint me professor i didnt think a man of science needed the backing of thugs
5605,what you mean you havent told your own people whats in store for them are you afraid zaroff
5606,no youve no quarrel with ramo i persuaded him to help me im the one to blame
5607,lets not say goodbye professor well be seeing each other again
5608,what happens now
5609,im sorry i got you into this ramo
5610,i know that voice
5611,oh i thought i recognised the voice how on earth did you manage it
5612,it was the sweetest sound ive ever heard in me life
5613,ben how did you find this place
5614,jamie
5615,our course is plain we must attack zaroff he has gone mad and hes bent on destroying the whole world weve only a short while in which to stop him
5616,food
5617,hmm
5618,no i mean zaroff and his people cannot exist without food
5619,yes but who provides it
5620,the fish people exactly and why because they are slaves but slaves like worms can be made to turn
5621,tell them ramo
5622,exactly zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great problem all his seafood goes bad in a few hours and has to be thrown away
5623,and so
5624,what would it do for us i dont know really but its a start do you think you can do it
5625,but you are irish
5626,we make this place our headquarters if nobodys here just leave a message
5627,kidnap professor zaroff
5628,you look splendid
5629,whats wrong with it
5630,thats what im supposed to be
5631,what do you expect this is atlantis now you know what to do
5632,wait a minute somethings gone wrong wheres zaroff
5633,a man
5634,about five foot nine
5635,black coat baggy trousers and a bow tie
5636,no as a matter of fact i havent
5637,polly
5638,zaroff
5639,zaroff
5640,youll see come on
5641,hes only bluffing nothing can start without him
5642,simple the great zaroff would have to be there to set off the explosion miss your big moment i think not
5643,some sort of attack
5644,i dont know wed better make sure
5645,get inside that laboratory
5646,no somebodys got to stay here to look after zaroff
5647,very well come on quick
5648,this is likely to take some time
5649,i dont think so better duck down here
5650,just a minute ive had a thought
5651,jamie youd better watch zaroff
5652,well we need a guide and only ramo knows all the passages
5653,come on come on
5654,yes
5655,zaroffs taken her as a hostage
5656,no ben jamie you go after polly only watch out zaroffs a desperate man
5657,ben you and i have other fish to fry come on
5658,its the governor its thous
5659,i dont know doesnt seem to have hit anything vital
5660,neither would you with a bullet in you
5661,i know come on we must get him to safety
5662,to the generating station
5663,here we are careful anyone at home
5664,wheres polly and jamie
5665,why
5666,well have to find them now listen everyone i have a plan
5667,it might even work
5668,our one hope of stopping zaroff is to flood all this lower part of atlantis
5669,yes the temple and zaroffs laboratory
5670,dont know well have to take that chance
5671,theyll have to be warned and moved to a higher level thats your job and seans
5672,ben and i will try and get into the generating station well turn up the power on the reactor break down the sea walls and flood the laboratory theres only one thing thats worrying me
5673,can we all swim    man
5674,well walk past him
5675,oh you think i look a bit conspicuous do you
5676,maybe youre right i know youre a guard and im a prisoner right
5677,now dont make a mess of it theres a good chap
5678,you dont know the password either
5679,very well done ben very well done im not quite sure about that not being normal bit but very well done i couldnt have done better myself
5680,come on now weve got little time
5681,cut those cables
5682,oh what a question of course i dont theres no rule against trying is there there now zaroffs laboratory he should be feeling the effects of this little lot any time now
5683,good day to you i hope im not too late
5684,oh how very nice of you but im afraid ive interrupted something important havent i oh yes i can see that i have you were on the point of exploding your firecracker werent you
5685,naturally they cant help themselves can they they must be devoted to you to allow you to blow them all to pieces
5686,oh have i dropped a brick oh i seem to have shaken some of them zaroff i think you ought to know the sea has broken through and is about to overwhelm us here
5687,then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess amdo with the indigestion
5688,time is running out zaroff hadnt you better call it a day
5689,i know ive got to get him out of there come over here ive got an idea
5690,all right ben
5691,i know but its much more exciting in the dark
5692,ben ive been thinking i cant leave zaroff to drown down there im going back for him
5693,but we cant leave him there
5694,zaroff hes cut off
5695,well how do i know all we can do is to go on going up come on
5696,boo
5697,me
5698,us polly good to see you come on you two
5699,right off we go into the wide blue yonder as someone was once heard to remark
5700,you sound very happy jamie
5701,hes got a point there
5702,control it of course i can control it
5703,if i wanted to its just that ive never wanted to
5704,right just for that ill show you now where shall we go i know lets go to mars
5705,do something i seem to have done something its all your fault wanting me to tamper with the steering im very sorry everybody but im afraid the tardis is out of control    ltback to the episode listing
5706,im trying to
5707,i have it back in control again
5708,huh oh no there must have been a reason for that
5709,all right lets move on while we can
5710,where do you think youre going
5711,oh no no no it was just a bumpy landing thats all
5712,well if you must go ashore only half an hour
5713,you cant go ashore like that you need space suits theres no atmosphere out there come on theres some in the chest
5714,come on now lets go over here
5715,its deserted
5716,possibly
5717,try a little jump
5718,careful one tear in that space suit and youll suffocate
5719,i dont know
5720,come on lets go
5721,no it hasnt
5722,we dont want to cause you any trouble just let us collect our young friend and well be off
5723,bacteria check
5724,ill have you know our tardis is as sterile as
5725,our space craft
5726,thank you very much
5727,thats what gave us such a bumpy landing some sort of gravity device
5728,yes
5729,ah yes it must be about the year 2050 ben
5730,there you are i was only twenty years out
5731,wont you introduce us first i am a doctor
5732,ah do you
5733,well i may be able to help you if youll introduce us
5734,and this is where you control the earths weather i see
5735,was it a bad year then
5736,some form of change in the weather
5737,wed better get out of these things and see how jamie is perhaps i could be of help in the sick bay now
5738,yes thank you
5739,yes thats right then this unit automatically controls the pulse the temperature and the breathing
5740,yes almost got striped trousers
5741,yes it will do very nearly everything
5742,oh hes not too bad hes a bit concussed and feverish but hell be all right with rest
5743,piper
5744,has this phantom piper appeared to jamie yet
5745,no but he does its important to him
5746,good well well see whether we can do just that
5747,dont get too near polly have a look on his chart
5748,oh yes the station doctor he was the first one to get it
5749,theres something about this epidemic that i dont quite understand its not like a real disease at all its almost as if
5750,i dont know but there are certain signs and symptoms which dont add up ben i want you to go along to the control room and keep an eye on things
5751,i dont know give a hand do anything but keep your eyes and ears open
5752,theres something very wrong here very wrong indeed
5753,shh its all right polly its only me we dont want to wake everybody up do we you look as though you could do with some sleep yourself
5754,oh ive been doing a little investigation
5755,i dont know
5756,oh its nothing it probably just a changeover in the time cycle
5757,oh well you see its rather interesting really you see on the moon they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights
5758,well its obvious isnt it they have to make their own day and night artificially up here or it would upset their whole biological time clock
5759,they wont know whether they were coming or going get it
5760,clever girl qed thats why its dark up here
5761,of course along at the control centre its probably broad daylight polly you wouldnt be making fun of me would you
5762,yes im afraid he is
5763,what did he mean by the silver hand id better report this to mister hobson
5764,have you tried his quarters
5765,im very sorry its doctor evans
5766,im afraid hes dead
5767,what was it
5768,this is no joke believe me
5769,that body cant just have vanished polly im going to leave you alone now just for a minute
5770,polly polly whats happened
5771,its all right dont be frightened whatever it was its all gone now
5772,cyberman
5773,are you sure
5774,nothing absolutely nothing
5775,so we all thought
5776,i must say it does sound a little odd
5777,no ben we cant go yet
5778,because there is something evil here and we must stay
5779,evil is what i meant there are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things things which act against everything that we believe in they must be fought this disease for instance it isnt really a disease at all but i can help you with it youll see ill find the cause for you
5780,yes certainly i just need to examine a few things thats all it should be simple
5781,we accept now tell me you have pathological equipment here yes
5782,yes ill have a look in here
5783,yes i think i can
5784,were going to start with this one
5785,yes i think i was once polly i think i took a degree once in glasgow 1888 i think lister hold that for me will you
5786,i shall need to examine everything clothes boots food towels soap everything will you get them for me please
5787,no not an idea but well find it out
5788,enchanté monsieur
5789,im just collecting specimens
5790,polly whats happened polly are you all right
5791,nothing absolutely nothing
5792,no its a complete blank all the tests are negative as far as i can see this whole ridiculous place is completely sterile
5793,hes not going to like it very much i simply dont understand it
5794,lister
5795,polly are you suggesting that im not competent to carry out these tests
5796,shh somebodys coming its mister hobson out for blood ours look busy quick
5797,do you mind
5798,would you mind standing away from the door and allowing it to close the slides the dust
5799,polly
5800,another boot
5801,this is extraordinary
5802,thank you
5803,excuse me please we are trying to help you you know
5804,ah
5805,i think perhaps i have
5806,yes i may be onto something but i must have some room how can i work under these conditions now out please come along outside im trying to work in here ben see that they stay outside
5807,what
5808,oh polly i only wish i had why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while i think of something
5809,yes just about
5810,yes clothes boots food
5811,absolutely nothing
5812,oh thank you
5813,ah coffee splendid thank you polly i think we could all do with a cup
5814,thank you polly
5815,dont touch him let me look
5816,try not to touch his skin
5817,its the sugar dont you see thats why the disease doesnt affect everyone its the sugar not everyone takes it no dont touch it
5818,just be patient just as i thought a large neurotropic virus
5819,no its a large infective agent that only attacks the nerves thats why the patients have got these lines on their faces and their hands it follows the course of the nerves under the skin
5820,oh it is the cybermen i believe they have deliberately infected the base
5821,one moment
5822,you say you searched all the base
5823,every nook and cranny
5824,no chance of anyone hiding anywhere
5825,did your men search in here
5826,did they
5827,did they search in here
5828,back
5829,no    cyberman 1
5830,and you to me  cyberman 1
5831,but that will kill everybody on the earth  cyberman 1
5832,what do you mean
5833,thought so sonic control that should be easy
5834,quick get these things off their heads
5835,well done ben
5836,mister hobson how far can the probe be lowered down
5837,thats no good
5838,can any other part of it be lowered
5839,they cant just march in here can they
5840,oh yes they tunnelled into the store room
5841,its too late come and see
5842,i refuse to believe that everythings got a weak point its just a question of waiting until it shows up thats all
5843,yes thats all it doesnt depend on us though
5844,it depends on what the cybermen are hatching up if a rocket is on its way theyre bound to be aware of that already
5845,what
5846,lets see
5847,its not far off
5848,deflected yes of course the gravitron
5849,no they havent but we have
5850,theres only one way that rocket could have been deflected into the sun from this very room
5851,if it is benson
5852,they must have got control of them again
5853,they may not be affected yet get along to the medical room barricade the door with everything you can find keep them in there at all costs
5854,put this on your face
5855,yes it is isnt it the gravitrons stopped
5856,well done ben heres another one for you
5857,made by a laser beam i would think
5858,well they havent got a gravitron or they wouldnt be after yours
5859,oh yes there
5860,is the gravitron still switched on
5861,then i shall certainly stay here     cyberleader
5862,yes of course
5863,yes and that gives me an idea what are they doing now theyre packing it away
5864,how far down can this be aimed
5865,can it be brought to bear on the surface of the moon
5866,has it ever been tried
5867,with evans gone the gravitron is all yours
5868,what does that matter now
5869,get someone to stand by that window and relay instructions direct to benoit
5870,start moving the probe down
5871,what but its way over their heads theres one chance well try bringing it down by hand
5872,is this still switched off
5873,round the back
5874,all your weight once more no its no use it wont shift
5875,why
5876,polly
5877,we did it
5878,im so sorry we damaged it
5879,possibly and i hope its the last we see of them
5880,oh that what a lot of fuss just a bumpy landing thats all it wont happen again i know
5881,lets have a look at the time scanner
5882,the time scanner instead of the normal picture showing where we are it gives you a glimpse of the future
5883,oh nonsense i havent used it very much its  not very reliable as you can see
5884,hmm
5885,im afraid youre wasting your time jamie
5886,unless im very much mistaken these creatures are so big theyre going to see us long before we see them
5887,go on ben
5888,where we are well according to my calculations were certainly in the future and on a planet very like the earth
5889,i dont know im guessing
5890,oh thank you
5891,well it was nothing anyone would have done the same well this is gay why all the music
5892,oh
5893,i feel perfectly all right as i am thank you
5894,please get me out of here im done to a turn
5895,my clothes dont need reviving
5896,oh my shoes
5897,precisely who wants to see their face in a pair of suede shoes whats this one
5898,exactly what i need full on
5899,oh oh i feel better oh thats more like it
5900,there you are i wondered what had happened to you
5901,do you belong here
5902,what oh no no its all right thank you i just thought id dropped something thats all
5903,oh just wondered thats all
5904,i dont hear anything
5905,its all right i wont let them hurt you
5906,why dont you listen to me
5907,i told him he wouldnt get hurt and he wouldnt believe me
5908,well no not exactly
5909,theres something else you forgetting gentlemen i set free someone that we caught in the first place
5910,he can run you know hes got legs he doesnt have to crawl over the ground
5911,no reason no reason at all
5912,oh oh thats where medok lives is it
5913,oh well thank you
5914,yes but what do you do
5915,oh thats not very polite i was interested in what you were saying
5916,no one why should i tell them now these creatures have you seen them clearly what do they look like
5917,but im interested what do they look like
5918,with big claws
5919,youve seen them in the colony
5920,has anyone else seen them
5921,why do they do that
5922,were you looking for me i was just looking around thats all
5923,oh im used to the dark i like it
5924,thank you
5925,oh im sure i will thank you goodnight
5926,same to you        ola
5927,dont move  ola
5928,wait if he comes in this way we go out the back if he comes in the back way well go out ahead here
5929,all right go back
5930,ill try to create a diversion
5931,do as i tell you
5932,go on go on all right well go through this opening when i give the word right now
5933,i dont see anything
5934,medok the guards theyll hear you
5935,medok
5936,yes i think i can confirm
5937,well it might be as well to
5938,i just thought id go and have a look
5939,what will they do to us
5940,reasons the last thing a man like ola will listen to
5941,good evening pilot oh what a very nice office you have here
5942,well
5943,oh forgive me this is interesting a telescopic viewing machine i imagine you can keep track on the entire colony from here and direct intercommunication between all parts very up to date i imagine excellent excellent and what
5944,a crime
5945,im not so sure pilot
5946,ah thats the point does he
5947,let me perhaps explain
5948,i hope youre not going to listen to everything that medok tells you
5949,well in his state of mind he might say anything
5950,perfectly all right thank you
5951,ah
5952,well as a matter of fact
5953,yes thank you medok i quite understand
5954,what will happen to medok
5955,why do you want everyone to be the same
5956,not at all thank you goodnight
5957,wake up polly
5958,ive been scotching a rumour or should i say scorching
5959,polly i think youve been listening to some very bad advice
5960,yes i know you have fast asleep very fast asleep polly do you smell anything a sort of sweet perfume
5961,never mind now polly i want you to forget everything that youve been dreaming
5962,well its just possible that youve been given a series of orders while youve been asleep you know do this do that do the other thing my advice to you is dont do anything of the sort dont just be obedient always make up your own mind what am i thinking of ben and jamie
5963,well by my calculations there should be a thin strand of wire in the wall here like a nerve tapping the subconscious of the human brain
5964,it should be here somewhere ah
5965,better some damage than loss of will power
5966,what law
5967,jamie how did you sleep
5968,thats a good sign that means they havent been able to get very deeply into your brain
5969,ill show you watch this
5970,im very much afraid im too late
5971,no its no use jamie
5972,youll have to violence will get you nowhere
5973,we cant leave ben
5974,no no not ben hes not in control of his actions hes been given a series of instructions and he cant help himself
5975,thank you jamie but id better go with captain ola
5976,rather neat dont you think and so simple i did it with this
5977,im proud of it
5978,my dear pilot your wall even you are subjected to this form of subconscious control
5979,thats better
5980,the least you can do is to say thank you
5981,polly polly whats the matter
5982,dont blame him polly
5983,i told you ben has come under control of the evil forces at the heart of this colony
5984,who is control
5985,have i i dont remember
5986,why dont you show him to us then
5987,that set the cat among the pigeons
5988,oh
5989,dreadful did you hear that rhyme the man who wrote that ought to be sent to the danger gang not us
5990,yes you might call us that
5991,what an extremely remarkable place what efficiency whatever do you make
5992,old what do you mean old im not old jamie
5993,but its much safer up here isnt it medok
5994,ah i see im perfectly capable of working in the pit thank you polly can have the safe job
5995,well im not sure i understand all this machinery myself
5996,what do you mean oh yes oh yes yes ill be supervisor
5997,nothing absolutely nothing
5998,but would have liked a mask
5999,no of course not it wasnt your fault you betrayed your friends
6000,the voices may not be right ben
6001,yes i know thats why youre here isnt it to spy on me what does control want to know this time cant you answer me you know ben this is very unlike you
6002,its hard for you to struggle against the voices isnt it ben but i warn you if you spy on the others watch out jamie doesnt catch you hes not so tolerant as i am
6003,yes now one must assume that the relative connection is constant now let me see ah yes i think thats right i shall give myself ten out of ten
6004,what
6005,in my head you know
6006,and youre one of them id say
6007,it does seem rather a tall order
6008,i wouldnt know how to do that take a look
6009,really huh in that case
6010,well i did have a little assistance
6011,oh no no no oh no no person no i simply mean that i took readings from the various dials they appeared to be related so i worked out the principle that controlled them it was simple really like doing a sum backwards
6012,yes you know given the answer whats the question
6013,oh well if you insist
6014,but if no one can escape
6015,they seem very emphatic about that
6016,but what if your prisoner escapes that way what will happen to you
6017,well arent you going to do something about it
6018,who has escaped anyway
6019,how do you know that ben
6020,and you didnt report it
6021,why not
6022,ben youre recovering i always thought you were a tough customer well done
6023,you dont seem very sure
6024,yes jamies got free by my calculations hes got a very good chance hold that for me will you
6025,well as i understand it jamies in the old shaft
6026,and for reasons of their own control dont want anyone there its forbidden territory
6027,i dont know ill be able to tell you when ive tested this to see how lethal it is
6028,on this planet its got a lot to do with everybody there now yes
6029,im trying to analyse this gas and im not having very much luck
6030,yes and they go to great efforts to get it the question is why
6031,oh mustnt find this
6032,theyre going to pour this gas in the old shaft gas they value above all else what do you make of that polly
6033,dont you see control are not pouring this poisonous gas into the old shaft to kill jamie theyve quite another reason
6034,before we act we must think now the macra that have come to the surface of this planet have not found sufficient gas in the atmosphere so theyve had to get somebody to pump it up from down below
6035,thats obvious polly obvious because theres something trapped down there they wish to keep alive
6036,im doing my best polly im thinking at top speed theres a pattern involved here a combination of pipes if one were to follow this one  control
6037,seven and eleven if thats the system in use it must go from here round up to there  control
6038,polly i think ive found the gas flow
6039,let me see let me see
6040,i hate to think it wont be anything very pleasant polly go and see what the first dial on the control desk registers
6041,hurry up
6042,full pressure and the other one come on
6043,zero now i think theres only one thing for it plus must be made minus and minus must be made plus
6044,the question is which is plus and which is minus
6045,oh just checking
6046,as you please but i think youre going to run into trouble
6047,well according to my calculations the pressure gauges are wrong
6048,ridiculous well thats as may be but after all three times three is nine and if you divide by half of its own cubic capacity to the formula pi over four squared i think youll have to agree with me
6049,why not
6050,oh so these are the inflow pipes are they thats all i wanted to know
6051,inflow inflow outflow inflow high pressure low pressure and out spells out
6052,its all right polly confusion is best left to the experts
6053,oh yes i have i can stand an operation on its head quicker than anyone there i think youll find ive revolutionised the entire gas flow of the colony
6054,polly see what those dials register now
6055,what does it read
6056,and the other one
6057,good splendid that means therell be a fine old gale of fresh air blowing along the old shaft any time now
6058,yes im sure it is but im sure youd like a little help
6059,its all right polly ive got his keys lock the door
6060,yes well the later the better the only thing we can do for jamie now is to give him time lock the door    control
6061,oh dear your keys try in your pocket or on the gantry or over there
6062,come on polly lets get out of here
6063,its locked
6064,youve got to come on together ive nearly got it locked there we are
6065,well it looks rather like a cupboard with a lot of pipes
6066,they must lead somewhere lets have a look
6067,yes very likely
6068,stay here im not spending the rest of my life with a lot of old pipes
6069,now come along polly im sure theres no need to be afraid well well i think theres no need to be afraid oh come on lets find out
6070,shh i hear voices very faint
6071,stay here a minute polly
6072,yes just as i thought these creatures would die without it
6073,i couldnt tell you when they were here in the first place polly theyre like germs in the human body theyve got into the body of this colony theyre living as parasites
6074,polly thats what i think they are
6075,yes very likely
6076,now then one system must provide them with the gas they need and the other one must be an outflow
6077,yes polly i think it might work
6078,good morning good morning good morning well everyone is up bright and early and the last two strangers are not missing after all oh come now we cant have bad temper and differences of opinion in this happy type colony say youre sorry ola say youre sorry pilot
6079,good morning jamie its nice to see you so well cared for
6080,oh its all right ive just come in to have a word with my old friend the pilot good morning ben i hope youre feeling more your old self
6081,of course not you cant arrest us now weve given ourselves up thats against the rules
6082,yes i do urgently come with me  control
6083,pilot  control
6084,that was a very brave thing to do
6085,come with me
6086,yes and youll soon see why
6087,bad laws were made to be broken follow me
6088,oh perhaps ive got an honest face  control
6089,dont give up now its just up here    control
6090,lets go  control
6091,i dont know but you must fight them
6092,take full command
6093,well you see what control really is
6094,i dont know we must be ready for anything
6095,pilot do you know where its coming from
6096,there must be a hidden inlet  control
6097,polly hold that in front of your mouth
6098,i think youre right jamie
6099,polly  control
6100,no     doctor
6101,switch them on ben then stand by to throw the lever  control
6102,relax relax more haste more waste pleasure is beautiful
6103,oh well
6104,they cant do that to me lets get out of here
6105,take a leaf out of jamies book give them the old dance routine    ltback to the episode listing
6106,scatter
6107,jamie come over here with me come on
6108,polly over here
6109,get your breath polly and tell us exactly what happened
6110,the murderer did he see you
6111,could you find this hangar again
6112,we havent seen him come on lets find this hangar
6113,polly this man that killed him would you recognise him again
6114,can you describe it to me
6115,this man was electrocuted his clothes are all scorched
6116,maybe but not one thats not been developed yet on this planet
6117,what the policeman oh no no jamie we must find the man in charge in this place
6118,theres nothing else we can do now lets find the main airport building come on
6119,this seems to be leading to the main airport building
6120,im afraid were wasting our time here jamie the sooner we find the authorities and tell it all to them the better come on
6121,this seems to be the way jamie
6122,ive got no time for that we want to see someone in authority
6123,you dont understand we have something important to report
6124,some sort of official mumbojumbo look weve just discovered a dead body out there did you hear me
6125,then please tell me where we can find them
6126,thank you thank you very much come on jamie
6127,we neither of us have passports now does that satisfy you
6128,what aircraft
6129,i really think that our mode of conveyance is irrelevant the important thing is that weve discovered a dead body out there and we want to report it to someone in authority
6130,well thank you
6131,thank you very much
6132,yes she saw the man killed
6133,oh what does it matter what sort of gun the point is he was killed and my friend saw it happen
6134,you wouldnt think it a joke if youd come and see the body
6135,oh look were all wasting time now are you going to come and see that body or am i going to find someone who really is in charge in this place
6136,well thank you thank you very much at last
6137,well lets see what we have got shall we
6138,for the police of course the trouble is i cant tell them who he was
6139,yes as a matter of fact he was there was nothing in his pockets to identify him
6140,yes i was rather surprised myself no wait a minute there was one thing
6141,this
6142,ah but its spanish and it hasnt been used
6143,exactly hello this is interesting
6144,its burnt fibres
6145,youre right jamie thats quite new well its good to see someone is using their intelligence
6146,that was definitely made by a ray gun
6147,unused foreign stamps
6148,you know what theyve done with it dont you
6149,the body somewhere theres a large packing case
6150,well im glad ive roused your interest
6151,come on jamie wed better humour him
6152,if youd had let me search the place properly we might have found
6153,commandant this is the girl i was telling you about
6154,now where have you been polly
6155,would you mind telling us your name
6156,you have a passport
6157,where did you learn such excellent english
6158,ah youre going to tell him about the dead body very sensible
6159,jamie i dont think were very welcome here when i say run we run
6160,run
6161,yes well have to keep out of their way until we can prove our story
6162,i dont think polly was kidding on in fact i dont think that was polly
6163,you dont want to believe everything you see jamie
6164,jamie what was the name of that hangar
6165,yes chameleon tours an advertisement for chameleon youth tours budget tours for young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty five
6166,inexpensive cheap this could be the bait do you know what a chameleon is jamie
6167,its the name of a small animal a lizard that can change its colour to merge with its background but its a name that could equally be applied to people as well people who change their personalities to suit their own ends budget tours young people between the ages of eighteen and twentyfive oh yes theres something strange going on here
6168,ben are you all right
6169,we cant talk here weve got to find somewhere to hide something about passports
6170,yes look who shes working for
6171,yes leave this to me polly
6172,now something has happened to you polly i want you to try to remember up to the time we left the hangar
6173,now think polly there were three of us in the hangar you were showing us something now what was it
6174,the hangar polly the chameleon hangar you said youd seen the man who did it
6175,anyone shot
6176,i didnt say anyone was shot or murdered polly
6177,i dont know but i mean to find out come on lets find that place where we can talk
6178,no ben not now what puzzles me is this girl pretending to be polly yet in a way she is polly
6179,no not in the time whatever happened to her happened to her in a few minutes look out
6180,no thats true you could investigate the hangar
6181,thank you ah commandant how nice to see you again
6182,at least hear what i have to say
6183,if youre going to speak to the police then tell them that theres something happening in this airport that may endanger human lives
6184,well since im obviously about to be arrested may i make one last request listen to me for just one minute
6185,but there was a dead body in the chameleon tours hangar
6186,why do you know something about it
6187,one step nearer and ill blow you all to smithereens catch
6188,what young lady wheres polly
6189,ah i shant be a minute       ben
6190,packing cases
6191,oh who is he
6192,detective inspector crossland scotland yard
6193,well thats the man we found in the chameleon tours hangar
6194,well he wasnt every impressed with it the last time
6195,well if you think so jamie stay here and keep an eye on the kiosk we shant be long
6196,oh but surely thats unimportant if
6197,thank you i have just carried out a search of the chameleon tours hangar in a packing case i found the body of a man
6198,no he was in a stupefied state a sort of coma
6199,i dont know his name but i have a feeling hes one of your employees
6200,in fact i think he may be in here    meadows 2
6201,things are not always what they seem oh careful its dangerous chameleon tours are not quite what they seem either
6202,well im afraid you wont believe it when you hear it however first inspector gascoigne was murdered with a ray gun
6203,a weapon that has not yet been developed on this earth
6204,there you see i knew you wouldnt believe it whats the use
6205,very well next i believe chameleon tours to be merely a front a cover
6206,for the mass kidnapping of young people
6207,yes at this very moment
6208,but brian briggs is your responsibility
6209,hes a young man who went on a chameleon tour and vanished
6210,well hes nowhere to be found
6211,and neither are my two friends which to my mind proves my point chameleon tours are a cover for the abducting of young people
6212,well in view of the facts that ive already presented the ray gun this pen and one or two other things i think were dealing with people who are not from this planet
6213,you see i knew you wouldnt believe me
6214,evidence what about this pen
6215,ill demonstrate it for you excuse me would you mind helping us  meadows 2
6216,do you call that arrant nonsense
6217,hmm
6218,thank you my dear
6219,what not even for these
6220,i think its the further evidence you required inspector yes just as i thought
6221,all falling into pattern this envelope is addressed to somewhere in germany
6222,well if we knew that we wouldnt be sitting here
6223,thank you commandant       meadows 2
6224,thank you very much
6225,ah  blade
6226,how many flights do they use a day
6227,how many planes do they use
6228,eight flights a day and only four planes is that normal
6229,which is the chameleon plane
6230,whats the range of your radar
6231,i was just wondering when this plane first appeared
6232,how long do you hold them after take off
6233,oh i see that means they might be anywhere
6234,i dont think ive been wasting a minute but ill go if you insist sam jamie    meadows 2
6235,jamie have you ever known me to be mistaken
6236,hey now watch out
6237,thats the wall the gasnozzles came out of
6238,youre right well thats clever thats very clever oh well makes life simpler for us now the man i froze came from here somewhere
6239,well somewhere in that solid wall theres a door
6240,i dont know perhaps if we find that door well find them come on you take that end ill take this
6241,we must hurry inspector crosslands keeping them busy at the moment but hell be no match for them if he presses them too far
6242,jamie look
6243,someone whos not used to the earths atmosphere very interesting ah a tv monitor set lets see what we can see
6244,well it looks like a hospital jamie were getting warmer which is a change from the last time i was here come on lets see if theres a first aid post in gatwick airport             jamie
6245,whats happening i cant move whats that
6246,thats just a small foretaste of whatll happen to us if we dont move and quickly
6247,no wait one thing its a long chance but it just might work have you got a mirror in that bag
6248,lets see yes thatll do hand it to me
6249,i cant move my hand jamie can you take it
6250,right now see if you can point it at that laser gun
6251,that thing on the wall
6252,well if you can reflect the light back weve got a chance
6253,quick jamie now
6254,i wonder if
6255,no
6256,i think they were needed for some purpose
6257,we were obviously too dangerous for them
6258,yes it means only one thing im afraid their plans are almost complete well have to act fast if were going to save polly and ben
6259,no ive not forgotten him sam but if my guess is right theyre all in the same place
6260,i dont know wait the first aid post
6261,we saw a first aid post on that monitor
6262,we must find it well come on youre not going to sit there all day are you just a minute we cant all go down to the medical unit
6263,did you get a good look at the man who tried to kill us
6264,go down to the chameleon kiosk and see if he comes in or out
6265,but be careful dont let him see you
6266,yes i just hope she doesnt try to be too adventurous
6267,well have you as right as rain in a minute now just get you down here there we are splendid
6268,very well but dont over do it yes this is the room we saw on the tv monitor
6269,its a rare tropical disease nurse im his doctor if he if he doesnt rally soon we shall we shall have to use somnalin
6270,yes yes somnalin i shall have to get him somewhere to lie down
6271,why not its just an xray room isnt it isnt that a couch behind the screen
6272,you refuse to help my patient
6273,oh i see well why didnt you tell me in the first place      doctor
6274,well no why
6275,but i told her to where is she now
6276,go down and join her jamie shes a very strong headed young woman see she doesnt come to any trouble
6277,commandant did the inspector say where he was going
6278,and now hes disappeared
6279,i dont think so my two friends became involved with chameleon tours and theyve both disappeared however you know what i thinks happened
6280,well thats a step in the right direction
6281,youre still thinking in earth terms
6282,might i have a word with you my dear
6283,i suspect that the medical centre is connected with all this
6284,now please dont get like him oh yes there is definitely a connection now i would like to get in there and have a look round
6285,but i would like to get that nurse out of the way first do you think that you could manage it for me
6286,im just going off duty but this gentleman will be pleased to attend to you
6287,very well done
6288,ample time
6289,its all right commandant she was acting on my instructions
6290,yes what do you think of these
6291,i think theres somebody here who can tell us
6292,i see oh well thesell have to wait
6293,how high can fighters go these days commandant
6294,how futile
6295,normally you dont plot them at this range
6296,that plane isnt just off course somethings happened to it
6297,i dont think youll get a reply
6298,its standing still
6299,why do you think the chameleon plane crashed into the sea
6300,but it stood still first
6301,why do you think that
6302,what about straight up
6303,exactly
6304,do you still think these people are from earth
6305,i think its just come in do you mind if i question him i think i know how to make him talk
6306,you only think hes working for you commandant your personnel are being systematically replaced and this is how they are doing it this is not meadows it only looks like meadows hes wearing one of these things on his arm
6307,stop him
6308,roll up his left sleeve
6309,this is part of the process  meadows 2
6310,how large is this satellite  meadows 2
6311,why not
6312,because if we do find them well find one of these on their arms eh and if we remove it something terrible will happen to you  meadows 2
6313,bring him in
6314,i think you two have something in common
6315,roll up your sleeves
6316,officer
6317,certainly   ive seen all i want to see ill have that if you dont mind
6318,would you rather be destroyed keep an eye on her officer bring him along
6319,youre lucky it was no worse
6320,just checking up now then where is the nurses original  meadows 2
6321,its all right sam its all right
6322,put her on here    meadows 2
6323,what on earth are these doing here
6324,jamie where
6325,pinch your ticket
6326,oh you mean jamie has
6327,first polly and ben now jamie weve no time to lose
6328,over here ill show you i found these in the medical centre records of twenty five people who work here each one of these has been taken over by chameleons
6329,what is it
6330,the last flight well thats exactly why they mustnt be arrested
6331,will you please listen to me
6332,these people must not be arrested
6333,somewhere in outer space there are fifty thousand young people three of my friends amongst them and somehow weve got to bring them back i want to get on this last flight which means the chameleons must think that everything is going according to plan
6334,at the moment you look like a man called meadows could you shed that identity and become somebody else
6335,good then in that case i shall pretend i am a chameleon and get on board that way
6336,i dont know till i get to the satellite and then i will have one card to play and thats up to you commandant
6337,the people the chameleons have taken over the originals are hidden somewhere here in gatwick airport you have got to find them
6338,no no no find them by all means but dont tamper with those arm sheaths otherwise we lose our one threat the one thing i may be able to bargain with
6339,that will depend entirely on nurse pinto
6340,now is everything clear youre sure you understand what i am asking you to do
6341,the doctor became too suspicious of me as meadows i was able to kidnap him the rest is as you can see
6342,you think that will be useful
6343,that means that youll be taking us up to the satellite
6344,the reprocessing its difficult to remember details
6345,in a safe place
6346,tell me where that is and ill have it transferred
6347,i dont know however weve got aboard that plane come on dont lets be late
6348,i dont know i should think were almost there dont worry
6349,i dont know lets follow the others
6350,we slip away and see if we can find these young people come on ah captain blade were carrying out your instructions were looking for the accommodation centre
6351,captain blade what is this i dont understand were here to stay arent we
6352,im very sorry i simply dont understand what you mean
6353,oh
6354,a chance to plead with you for the lives of fifty thousand young people
6355,and what are you
6356,why jamie  jamie 2
6357,well youve lost his scots accent in the process oh i much preferred the original
6358,really
6359,itll be one of your friends ive no doubt its understandable the special people up here feel more secure if their originals are actually in the satellite
6360,the director has nothing to worry about because his original detective inspector crossland is actually on board but  wheres your original  and wheres yours
6361,well as i see it there are two categories people like your director and that man over there whose originals are safe on board here and then there are people like you two whose originals have been left behind at gatwick airport if theyre tampered with youre finished
6362,yes youd better process me quickly because any minute now youll cease to exist youre first on the list
6363,oh surely you understand weve found all of the originals the commandant at the airport is going to deprocess them one by one starting with you unless i stop him
6364,ah that i cant tell you but theyd been searching for some time and just as i was about to board the aircraft i got a signal which meant that theyd been successful otherwise i wouldnt have come well if you dont believe me check with gatwick airport i imagine you know its radio frequency
6365,youre going to get a surprise when twenty five of your people disintegrate
6366,now then now what is it you want me to do
6367,tell me what happens if you disintegrate in the middle of my being processed i mean will that do me any harm being suspended between one thing and another so to speak
6368,oh dear
6369,youre quite sure its safe now
6370,by the time they tell you that theres nothing wrong with it youll all have disintegrated except of course the director
6371,yes youre quite right it only concerns these two ill keep my mouth shut
6372,release the nurse first  commandant
6373,are you quite all right my dear
6374,good commandant this is the doctor speaking
6375,stand by while i negotiate now then i will tell you my terms i will guarantee your continued existence if you will return to earth all the young people you abducted
6376,then reverse the process
6377,in your former state im afraid your scientists will have to think of some other way out of your dilemma
6378,commandant are you still there  commandant
6379,you will take me to them i will call you again  commandant
6380,jamie ha im glad to see you alive
6381,ill explain to you one day well come along out you look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there sit down  its all right hes a friend now sit down while i find the others ah inspector crossland there we are now ben polly and back to gatwick
6382,ah good
6383,yes im going with nurse pinto are you going inspector
6384,ill see you on the plane nurse
6385,so long as you keep your side of the bargain you may return to your planet unharmed perhaps your scientists will be able to find some way out of their dilemma i may be able to give them one or two ideas of my own
6386,yes yes
6387,theres just one thing commandant
6388,our tardis our police box
6389,the police box on the runway
6390,thank you commandant
6391,goodbye samantha come along jamie we must find ben and polly and get to the tardis

6396,its july july the 20th to be precise
6397,you really want to go dont you
6398,yes i know youre lucky i never got back to mine all right then off you go now go on ben can catch his ship and become an admiral and you polly you can look after ben
6399,ben
6400,well youd better hurry the commandants car waiting
6401,yes jamie so am i well weve got things to do
6402,well i didnt tell the others but weve lost the tardis
6403,it was outside its not there now
6404,i dont know but thats what were going to find out come on  ltback to the episode listing
6405,excuse me
6406,i wonder if you can help us
6407,oh i see
6408,he means the police telephone box
6409,yes well tardis thats another name for it
6410,thats right tardis is a is a gaelic word jamie hush
6411,yes i know well anyway its our property and weve come to collect it
6412,let me see this please
6413,yes so i see j smith doesnt really help us does it
6414,oh no i dont think wed better do that jamie i think wed better talk to the police
6415,thank you very much youll be hearing from us
6416,perhaps i think wed better keep an eye on him
6417,well didnt you notice his overalls they were much too small for him and the top sheet of his clip board was different to all the others and when we mentioned the police he became friendly
6418,thats him there he goes
6419,for hire
6420,follow that car
6421,this is his car he must be around here somewhere
6422,well have you tried the door
6423,ken ken who
6424,no good hes out cold see if we can find some water somewhere hello this is something this really is something
6425,thats whats been bothering me jamie too
6426,its between two and three hundred pounds yes it is a lot at least for what he had to do put on a pair of overalls and just hang around come to think of it why hang around he was obviously planted why not just go off in the lorry
6427,i dont know
6428,its all right its only a train
6429,well its a train there are carriages and they go on wheels on rails and theyre drawn by a steam hey come back
6430,there is this  the tricolour its a coffee bar apparently and thats not all
6431,well normally people pull out their matches from right to left these have been torn out from left to right
6432,it means weve got to find a coffee bar called the tricolour and look for a man called ken or kenneth someone whos lefthanded
6433,but its so little jamie its too little he might only have been there once theres no guarantee hell ever go there again
6434,bruce
6435,if only we knew what he looked like jamie
6436,weve got to untangle this you know
6437,oh
6438,no no theres more to it than that why leave that man in the hangar to give us a clue
6439,there is no delivery firm of that name not in the london area anyway i checked in the phone book
6440,maybe
6441,yes if only we knew who our enemies are
6442,no something else i can feel them closing in all around us
6443,because youre so much better at them than i am jamie now what did you find out
6444,oh dear
6445,jamie im being stared at is there something wrong with me

6460,its interesting in fact jamie its quite remarkable
6461,hmm youve noticed that
6462,yes so it seems except
6463,except that all these things are not reproductions theyre all genuine
6464,here look at this to one deed box four guineas this is a bill from william dearing and son 1866
6465,yes if you were going to make a forgery wouldnt you try to dirty it up a bit yellow the edges crinkle it up this is brand new
6466,what
6467,yes
6468,well done
6469,but its not very likely is it the only way to find out is to ask waterfield
6470,im sure i heard somebody shouting jamie weve got to get in there
6471,its too pliable
6472,you made the appointment
6473,yes well we thought wed be early what are you doing here
6474,yes i think youve got some explaining to do mister kenneth perry
6475,so its keith do you know a man called bob hall
6476,well he keeps some very rough company including a man called ken
6477,what what do you know about kennedy
6478,but it belongs to me
6479,because because of whats inside it and because it happens to be my property
6480,well is there another way through this door is locked
6481,youre going to show me where this yard of yours is
6482,hes dead
6483,no hes doing the right thing
6484,yes well well have to find it before he comes back now i wonder what this telephone interference is

6486,yes yes the tardis now how did he die his limbs are stiff his hands clenched look he died in horrible agony look at his face hello
6487,yes now he fell like that with his arm stretched out jamie go out into the hall and measure the length of it up to the door here
6488,its only five from the door to the wall there must be another room behind here
6489,yes youre right now waterfield will have the key wed better find something to prise it open with
6490,yes dont open that
6491,the master mister waterfield
6492,not very well no ooh

6496,yes im feeling very much better but i dont seem to be able to remember the date and where i am
6497,and this is mister edward waterfield i presume you dont keep your appointments do you
6498,yes indeed there were
6499,yes well
6500,and just what do you think youre up to you steal my property you spirit jamie and me a hundred years back in time and you murder a man along the way
6501,i dont believe you
6502,power victims what do you mean
6503,who are they
6504,i will listen i promise
6505,oh yes yes very impressive and now perhaps youll explain what all this is about
6506,patience you dont seem to understand whats happened a man has been murdered you behave as though were going on sunday school outing
6507,why have you brought us here who are these enemies of yours these ones you say control you
6508,inhuman
6509,please do
6510,to try to find a way of exploring time
6511,yes
6512,static
6513,you mentioned static electricity

6516,they knew about me these creatures
6517,what are they called these creatures
6518,oh yes perfectly
6519,obey obey what do you want
6520,what experiment
6521,what sort of test
6522,i will not be your slave
6523,jamie
6524,why do you ask about jamie
6525,what do you mean tested how
6526,what have you done with your infernal meddling what is this test do either of you know
6527,in the long run yes
6528,possibly
6529,possibly
6530,and now theyve got jamie
6531,i have made up my mind
6532,do you think im going to allow jamie to run into danger without telling him anything no i will not
6533,we shall see
6534,jamie
6535,so it seems so who can have kidnapped him
6536,everything you say waterfield is true if we cannot find jamie the daleks will take pleasure in killing everyone in sight and their greatest pleasure will be in killing me
6537,straw
6538,a piece of straw
6539,oh good day to you
6540,yes i know i was listening lets have a look at that head of yours
6541,come along
6542,i know whats happened to victoria
6543,shes a prisoner of the daleks
6544,yes of course i did
6545,oh fiddlesticks bosh jamie will cooperate you may be certain of that
6546,yes perfectly sure jamie will do everything he is asked to do now come along we must go and find maxtible
6547,then were quits arent we
6548,yes
6549,they want the human factor is that right
6550,very complex and you want to introduce this human factor into the race of daleks
6551,well why choose jamie for this test
6552,but why him why not me
6553,why
6554,i see what is this
6555,skaro
6556,you want the human factor introduced i see
6557,i will make up my own mind
6558,and if i agree it means the creation of a race of super daleks my tardis i have no choice do i very well i agree
6559,i quite understand
6560,what must jamie do
6561,its all right mollie
6562,never mind
6563,thatll do yes mollie thank you very much its all right
6564,i wouldnt dream of telling him
6565,thank you very much bye bye
6566,oh i thought youd be interested i watched the charge of the light brigade magnificent folly
6567,oh just looking around
6568,jamie youre in a temper
6569,what was that
6570,you were eavesdropping
6571,now you listen to me jamie
6572,waterfield did not murder that man
6573,the daleks forced him to
6574,now you listen to me
6575,just a little argument
6576,jamie seems to think that im lying to him
6577,he doesnt believe the daleks are here
6578,well what can i do now be fair jamie waterfields tied hand and foot because of his daughter and were tied hand and foot because of the tardis
6579,now just where are you going
6580,no not a bit but one word of warning dont you try to be a oneman army you leave well alone i wont have you ruining everything trying to rescue victoria waterfield now you understand
6581,adding a little fuel to the fire tell maxtible that ill be along to his laboratory shortly
6582,oh yes quite sure once our young friend has cooled his heels a bit hell launch off on his own and you dropped the hint about the south wing beautifully
6583,every single one of jamies reactions will be recorded on these dalek machines
6584,oh yes i quite understand
6585,im sure you will and every step of jamies progress will be covered
6586,but jamie saved the turks life
6587,if he hadnt he would have died in that room of yours if you want the human factor a part of it must include mercy
6588,human beings have five senses sight hearing taste smell and touch but there is instinct too jamie used instinct to avoid your trap
6589,suicidal attacks to gain an objective postulate selfpreservation is a strong human factor jamie and his new friend are determined to succeed but finding the girl is only part getting her away is another
6590,are you sure you wont join me
6591,oh dear well something else perhaps
6592,i know let me ring for some food now do join me
6593,yes i do dont i
6594,oh how very unsociable
6595,liba oh no thank you im perfectly happy here thank you im perfectly happy
6596,yes but i thought id have a little rest i wanted to talk to you
6597,about you mister terrall you interest me do you know something ever since i came to this house i why this is circassian surely
6598,circassian ever since i came to this house i have never seen you eat or drink anything now thats curious isnt it
6599,yes id thought of that but waterfield has never seen you eat or drink either
6600,oh do i
6601,touch� oh look
6602,oh thank you excuse me
6603,no mister terrall i am not a student of human nature i am a professor of a far wider academy of which human nature is merely a part all forms of life interest me
6604,very nearly jamie was magnificent but then i knew he would be he produced a whole battery of emotions each one of which is imprinted in here see
6605,well a part of it at least the better part courage pity chivalry friendship even compassion some of the virtues
6606,yes its a positronic brain were going to implant one of these into each of these three daleks here the dormant ones
6607,perhaps
6608,perhaps itll drive them insane
6609,well that is their purpose at least i imagine it is i cant help feeling that theres more in this than meets the eye
6610,yes the three capsules are nearly ready
6611,yes yes i understand
6612,hmm
6613,what do you mean
6614,oh you should have thought of that some time ago
6615,its no use having a conscience now
6616,it was too late when they took away your daughter it was too late when you stole my tardus and lured me to this house and this century
6617,homo superiense
6618,that is their purpose
6619,that mister waterfield remains to be seen
6620,yes i dont think you quite realise what youre saying but yes it may come to that it may very well come to that
6621,jamie what have you done
6622,do you want to save this mans life
6623,do you
6624,then take him away from here as far away as possible go and get the carriage round to the stables you go too mollie well bring him out you now go along
6625,yes i thought he was under some sort of control come along
6626,yes dont worry about them
6627,yes i know theres danger you must leave here immediately
6628,now you leave them to us take ruth maxtible with you shes waiting for you at the stables
6629,victoria is safe and well
6630,im positive now well take care of her you must leave immediately
6631,yes
6632,yes jamie and we must turn that lie into a truth
6633,well jamie the experiments nearly over ive had no sleep ive been up all night but its been worth it
6634,oh now whats the matter
6635,no it is not a game
6636,jamie
6637,thats just not true jamie ive never held that the end justifies the means
6638,i care about life i care about human beings do you think i let you go through that dalek test lightly
6639,its all right jamie theyre friends
6640,now dont get the wrong idea they are the experiment
6641,because human beings jamie no matter how brilliant they may be are always within reach of other human beings now then its all right jamie dont worry
6642,what is it
6643,where are you taking me
6644,weve done it maxtible theyve got the human factor weve done it what are they doing now look theyre all joining in theyre playing train
6645,oh oh now what is it oh were on a roundabout theyre playing roundabout oh im getting dizzy oh dear oh im dizzy oh im dizzy
6646,maxtible do you hear that theyve got a sense of humour
6647,yes
6648,they are
6649,oh thank you
6650,oh theyre just young children but theyll grow up very fast within a matter of hours now come here all of you come along gather round come here now then come along come along
6651,oh this is jamie hes a friend
6652,well say hello jamie
6653,you know what a friend is dont you its somebody who likes you who wants to help you and share with you
6654,i have given you all names alpha beta and omega
6655,yes
6656,yes
6657,yes
6658,yes yes yes now this is jamie and i am doctor we are friends
6659,go called go where what do you mean go
6660,return to skaro but thats the dalek plan
6661,victoria we left her in the secret passage come along follow me
6662,waterfield whats happened to you
6663,but this is a time switch
6664,no wait a minute eighty nine eighty eight eighty seven just about a minute thats all weve got
6665,this isnt a firework wed have to toss this half a mile well have to follow the daleks to skaro jamie open the doors come along
6666,time machine jamie give me a hand quickly
6667,quick jamie the time switch
6668,jamie
6669,yes it is
6670,are you sure
6671,come along then we must get along
6672,oh no the city is all around us at least its beneath us come along
6673,not a sound i think the daleks are in for a little surprise
6674,perhaps it was jamie
6675,no you mustnt
6676,you cant youll go over the edge
6677,what is your name
6678,oh i see
6679,thank you
6680,oh im all right thank you lead on
6681,what was that screaming
6682,where
6683,think i dont know my own mark that wasnt the real omega at all
6684,no no i dont like the look of this back the way we came
6685,we meet at last i wondered if we ever would
6686,yes i have implanted the human factor in the three daleks that you gave me when i say run run
6687,promise me jamie i was merely telling my friend that the day of the daleks is coming to an end
6688,its very simple somewhere in the dalek race there are three daleks with the human factor gradually they will come to question they will persuade other daleks to question you will have a rebellion on your planet
6689,i say yes ive beaten you and i dont care what you do to me now
6690,what
6691,you still have those three daleks to contend with
6692,i wont work for you
6693,you want me to guess it means to obey to fight to destroy to exterminate i wont do it
6694,people have done worse for less jamie
6695,oh i dont know the alchemists of the middle ages made transmutation their main aim in life
6696,even in the twentieth century its still considered scientifically possible
6697,whether it is or whether it isnt is beside the point
6698,why are the daleks doing this
6699,daleks dont keep their promises
6700,jamie
6701,yes yes we quite understand
6702,im trying to puzzle out a problem victoria the daleks say im going to do something for them something i would rather die than do
6703,oh no the daleks know me well enough by this time
6704,oh no no it isnt that either you see there isnt a persuasion strong enough not even the offer of all the lives in this room
6705,five lives against a whole planet well its not a choice is it
6706,even if i could trust the daleks even if they set us free we still couldnt go back to earth i suppose i might try and take you all to another universe i might even try and take you to my own planet
6707,yes yes i live a long long way away from earth oh just a minute maxtible arthur terrall the daleks put some sort of control device on him
6708,atomic weight and gravity of iron
6709,maxtible if you value your life dont go near that machine
6710,is that what you want me to do to the people of earth
6711,human beings into daleks
6712,stay where you are that is an order
6713,i obey
6714,i must examine the machine
6715,jamie jamie jamie
6716,jamie when i give you the word bring everyone through this archway through the door
6717,trust me
6718,take me to your emperor
6719,a dalek questioned an order
6720,all daleks must pass through the archway door the dalek with the human factor will then become a dalek again will become as this human and i have become
6721,go on quickly through the door follow them through the door oh its all right ive changed over the factors i used one of the capsules from my test dalek ive given them all the human factor go on go on
6722,well ive got things to do and ive been through already
6723,i dont come from earth jamie now down the corridor turn to the left and find the tunnel ill join you there later
6724,quickly this way follow me daleks this way come on
6725,why not question what work tell them
6726,ask the emperor
6727,why
6728,defend yourselves daleks the black daleks are attacking you
6729,thats right question
6730,the black daleks are attacking every man
6731,the emperor has commanded it
6732,because you question defend yourselves destroy the emperor or be destroyed yourselves
6733,destroy the emperor
6734,yes i know ive finished now
6735,you saved my life didnt you
6736,dont worry about victoria well look after her
6737,the emperor has commanded your destruction
6738,but your friends are fighting for you
6739,down there help them
6740,jamie jamie
6741,kemel
6742,yes yes im afraid he is but he didnt die in vain i think weve seen the end of the daleks forever jamie we must get along to the tardis its over there
6743,were not going to leave her shes coming with us the end the final end    ltback to the episode listing
6744,oh its the tardis its my home at least it has been for a considerable number of years
6745,what these
6746,oh no no no no dont laugh its true your father and maxtible were working on the same problem but i have perfected a rather special model which enables me to travel through the universe of time
6747,well if we count in earth terms i suppose i must be about four hundred yes about four hundred and fifty years old yes well quite now i think victoria might find that dress a little impracticable if shes going to join us in our adventures jamie show her where she can find some new ones will you
6748,a smooth take off a smooth take off what a nerve         parry
6749,if you put it like that i certainly will
6750,thank you
6751,now whats been happening over here
6752,ah and you think we did it oh no i can assure you that we had nothing to do with the death of this man he appears to have been electrocuted trying to open these doors perhaps
6753,expedition
6754,really does it show
6755,no not until they tell me what the purpose of their expedition
6756,the problem i take it is to open these doors right
6757,im afraid that that became impossible the moment that name was mentioned
6758,cybermen
6759,we must stay
6760,we shall stay and help you with your search
6761,thats just it you so obviously do now im sure we can agree i can open those doors for you
6762,ah good thats all settled and now we shall open these doors
6763,its perfectly safe now
6764,im afraid its beyond my strength
6765,jamie
6766,quite i think here is a gentleman who can open these doors for us
6767,oh theres no danger now unless of course hes afraid
6768,no wait wait i would be very careful in there if i were you
6769,the poor fellow who died drained all there electricity out of his body its perfectly safe to go in there now
6770,but id still id still be very careful if i were you very careful indeed come on lets go and join them come on victoria
6771,a bit short oh i shouldnt worry about that look at jamies
6772,come along come along lets go and see what the others are doing shall we come along
6773,not exactly jamie but very nearly
6774,and the other two of course
6775,oh yes one in that section and one in that section over there activated i imagine by this simple logical system over here here we are i think
6776,oh no not really its all based upon symbolic logic the same as you use in computers the opening mechanism for this door an or gate you call it
6777,oh i use my own special technique
6778,keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut
6779,no not really i think its about time we gave mister klieg a chance to show off his archaeological skills i love to see the experts at work dont you
6780,yes but why do it at all
6781,some things are better left undone and i have a feeling that this is one of them
6782,well its all too easy isnt it
6783,insoluble
6784,oh i wouldnt say that
6785,yes well what youve done here is mostly right
6786,you see if you take any progressive series it can be converted into binary notation if you take the sum of the integrants and express the result as a power series then the indices show the basic binary blocks only i wouldnt do it if i were you oh no i really wouldnt do it
6787,you fool why couldnt you leave it alone
6788,i dont know perhaps the cybermen arent quite as dormant as you imagine we must find out what has happened to the others
6789,i wouldnt touch the projector controls if i were you someone might get hurt
6790,yes there is now let me see
6791,yes i think this is the sequence stand by to let her out will you and if you my dear would stand well clear thank you right
6792,no i dont expect you did youll have to be a little more careful in future wont you now come along we must go and see whether jamie is all right come along
6793,oh jamie dont touch that control
6794,well which one was it
6795,what exactly happened here jamie what did you do what sequence did you use
6796,they
6797,the question is what killed him
6798,i saw something
6799,poor haydon was looking at that screen in the direction we all were right
6800,its not so obvious when you consider he was shot in the back
6801,see for yourself now if the cybermen didnt shoot him what did the answer i think lies over here jamie
6802,can you remember exactly what you did what sequence you used
6803,you must try i want to repeat it all when i give the word
6804,maybe i dont know now jamie when youre ready
6805,now there is a distinct element of risk in what im asking you all to do so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once not you jamie
6806,not if you go back against that wall in that corner there now please right jamie
6807,its all right i think i think its all right now yes you see its just a mock up a model no dont touch that that gun may be wired up too
6808,no i dont think so i think its a testing room for weapons this is a purely robotic cyberman theres no human material in it at all hes a target for weapons
6809,victoria be careful let me see that
6810,its one of those id leave it alone if i were you come along
6811,or something
6812,i dont think weve got much choice
6813,captain you do have another reason for not wanting them back on the ship dont you
6814,or what
6815,i see
6816,all right
6817,well but cant we stay here it seems a pleasant enough room to me
6818,oh yes i was forgetting i can cant i
6819,no not just yet awhile no but you and jamie can go back to the tardis if you wish
6820,jamie
6821,good
6822,its all right jamie your colleague has very strong hands
6823,enough to do a good deal of damage if let loose in the right place
6824,logical yes but
6825,really
6826,i think perhaps your logic is wearing a little thin
6827,congratulations
6828,victoria you would be much safer up here
6829,thank you
6830,mister toberman
6831,then i stay here too
6832,remember what i said be very careful
6833,well which way do we go
6834,yes
6835,in there jamie frozen forever all their evil locked away with them and so it must remain
6836,a signal that theyre never going to get
6837,perhaps it wasnt them wheres jamie
6838,mister klieg doesnt seem to be very worried
6839,conveniently labelled in symbolic logic i notice
6840,if it is the opening device
6841,jamie come back
6842,what do you think youre doing
6843,jamie
6844,so did i jamie
6845,i wanted to know what he was up to
6846,you think the cybermen will help you
6847,i think its their leader their controller jamie
6848,ah i see a trap a very special sort of trap too
6849,well dont you see they only wanted superior intellects thats why they made the trap so complicated
6850,yes and weve done exactly as youve calculated havent we
6851,no no we wouldnt even reach the ladder its too risky
6852,well play for time wait our chance leave it to me excuse me may i ask a question why did you submit yourself to freezing you dont have to answer that if you dont want to
6853,oh how
6854,oh thank you very much ah yes the lunar surface
6855,so thats why you attacked the moonbase
6856,oh no no keep away keep away keep away from me
6857,if you would let go of me i can stand still youre breaking my arm
6858,no jamie theyre coming back
6859,is he all right
6860,that way
6861,no im not sure but try it ill be with you in a minute
6862,captain weve got to stop them
6863,no we cant do that the hatch we must get there first come on
6864,oh ah hes got my leg
6865,its no use
6866,no no its too soft it must be toberman and klieg
6867,yes theyre more dangerous down there than they are up here
6868,excuse me please
6869,do you still think you can form an alliance with the cybermen mister klieg
6870,well what about the testing room theres only one door they cant get out
6871,we shall see
6872,im on your side remember hey why didnt you wake me i should have been on watch half an hour ago
6873,why me
6874,oh i think i know is it because im
6875,well thats very considerate of you victoria but between you and me im really quite lively actually all things being considered
6876,yes i know i know
6877,you miss him very much dont you
6878,no of course you wont but you know the memory of him wont always be a sad one
6879,eh
6880,oh
6881,oh yes i can when i want to and thats the point really i have to really want to to bring them back in front of my eyes the rest of the time they sleep in my mind and i forget and so will you oh yes you will youll find theres so much else to think about so remember our lives are different to anybody elses thats the exciting thing theres nobody in the universe can do what were doing you must get some sleep and let this poor old man stay awake
6882,callum callum
6883,dont move callum dont move
6884,back against the controls everybody
6885,lay this down on the ground come on
6886,come on
6887,youre wasting your time there are too many of them now do what i say come back
6888,well theyre a form of metallic life they home on human brainwaves and attack
6889,yes quite safe now the power cable generated an electrical field and confused their tiny metal minds you might almost say that theyve had a complete metal breakdown
6890,come on now mind your feet
6891,you still think you can bargain with the cybermen
6892,use maybe but youll never control the cybermen
6893,yes jamie yes
6894,plan
6895,no
6896,quiet jamie
6897,yes yes certainly jamie professor
6898,i think it best come on come along
6899,yes one moment
6900,in a moment jamie now are you ready
6901,now then where would you rather have him in or out of there
6902,only we must make sure that he stays in there
6903,i think not i think there must be some sort of internal timing mechanism jamie i hope you made those ropes secure
6904,good
6905,look what theyve done youre not like them youre a man like us you must help us he has killed kaftan you must help us
6906,jamie the hatch
6907,are there any more
6908,no wait a minute id better go down there
6909,its the only way to make sure
6910,no wait you stay and look after victoria ill take somebody else
6911,they must be destroyed do you see evil must be destroyed now come
6912,come come on come on
6913,thank you
6914,i shant need that
6915,no quietly theyre only asleep theyre not frozen yet now you watch them i have things to do now let me see
6916,klieg
6917,yes as you say such a combination between intelligence and power would make you formidable indeed why youd be commander of the universe with your brilliance it makes the imagination reel with the possibilities
6918,perhaps its not too late
6919,no jamie dont you see
6920,well now i know youre mad i just wanted to make sure
6921,you know ive heard all this before somewhere
6922,all right go ahead kill us
6923,quick jamie these two levers together
6924,what youve got to trip that first
6925,im going to reelectrify the main doors
6926,only this time im going to include the hatch and the control panel
6927,anyone touching any of them will get a considerable shock in fact a fatal one
6928,now everyone outside and please take him with you i shall be glad to see him outside
6929,there we are thats done now we just have to close the main doors and the circuit is complete
6930,jamie you go that way ill go this way that way will give us more of a chance when i say run run
6931,well get a shock we must find something to insulate i know that shoring timber over there hurry up hurry up hes coming
6932,quickly we must keep him inside or else all our workll be wasted
6933,you must do
6934,toberman come away
6935,goodbye
6936,i know i know goodbye
6937,yes jamie on the other hand i never like to make predictions come along    ltback to the episode listing
6938,i dont believe it marvellous after all this time
6939,well dont you see jamie its the himalayas and i do believe were in exactly the right now wait a minute
6940,shush shush
6941,shush jamie shush yes of course its the earth yes yes i think im right yes
6942,yes thats it i knew it i knew it its incredible right oh no no not india this is tibet thats where we are tibet now theres no time to be lost come along jamie we must find the ghanta
6943,the ghanta the ghanta i put it here somewhere come along jamie help me
6944,i told you its good lord i havent seen that for years
6945,no no no no its a well whatever it is its nice to see it again
6946,thank you come along victoria
6947,no jamie
6948,yes i was afraid of that
6949,come along help me find the ghanta
6950,ghanta
6951,oh what is it you dont know oh its a bell
6952,yes its a tibetan bell actually a holy relic this one is quite small it has a dragon on it as a matter of fact it has rather an interesting history it was oh ah ha yes ill have that  the doctor takes out a huge fur coat
6953,yes i thought i might i think ill go and have a scout around now you two find the bell its very important
6954,because down there its going to guarantee us the welcome of a lifetime
6955,yes ah yes
6956,oh splendid splendid

7001,you cant possibly leave
7002,men of peace

7005,keep back theyll kill you
7006,i told you to keep away hes lead you into a trap
7007,of course

7009,ive no idea now this creature what was it like
7010,it does sound like your abominable snowman travers
7011,no i always thought so
7012,what made this i wonder what its for oh well
7013,including creatures that dont seem to be flesh and blood  ralpachan
7014,whats the matter  ralpachan
7015,do you really think theyll attack
7016,yes but if they do do you think you could capture one i would like to examine one
7017,thank you jamie
7018,oh victoria
7019,victoria i think this is one of those instances where discretion is the better part of valour jamie has an idea come along
7020,come along
7021,i can assure you i am not
7022,you were right about one thing victoria this creature certainly doesnt seem to be flesh and blood
7023,its not your abominable snowman either travers look
7024,no i dont think so its more like a robot
7025,now why has it stopped wait a minute wait a minute
7026,no but there has been
7027,precisely
7028,to have a look outside the gates i want that unit come on jamie
7029,but why not
7030,well if you dont trust us at least send thomni or one of your other warriors
7031,if you want us to help you
7032,oh dear a very obstinate man
7033,oh i wouldnt say that jamie hes just doing his duty as he sees it
7034,oh thank you thomni
7035,what is it
7036,yes
7037,yes but ive thought of that but the thing was as light as a feather there couldnt have been anything inside it unless where is it
7038,i remember i put it down somewhere
7039,the buddha i put it down by the buddha oh now please thomni please
7040,oh dear
7041,no tact jamie ill handle this hello guard good evening i wonder if you can help us i left a silver sphere by the buddha there
7042,travers are you sure he didnt pick it up
7043,gone
7044,but thats impossible
7045,yes but why
7046,i wonder are you sure he didnt take the sphere with him
7047,right jamie
7048,yes yes travers i cant believe he has anything to do with these robots
7049,khrisong khrisong i must speak with you
7050,have you given travers permission to leave the monastery
7051,well hes gone
7052,the guard at the gate said youd given him permission
7053,its about time you let me help you
7054,oh well whats done is done ah jamie
7055,i see khrisong you must see that it is vital that i examine one of these control units now the one that jamie bought down from the mountains has disappeared someone is trying to stop us learning the truth
7056,khrisong behind you yeti
7057,dont be a fool
7058,come on jamie quick get him inside they came to get their ball back
7059,they didnt come to fight they came for the sphere
7060,pretty sure they didnt want me to examine it
7061,that sphere is like a brain they had to get it back
7062,id still like to know what happened to that one
7063,yes it could be anyway its a help
7064,well with the right sort of equipment these signals can be tracked
7065,yes jamie
7066,weve got to back to the tardis
7067,yes but its outside there on the mountain
7068,come on lets get me coat
7069,theyre not moving
7070,perhaps theyre switched off i wonder
7071,yes perhaps youre right come on
7072,oh oh im just taking a breather thats all
7073,no no nothing
7074,listen
7075,yes thats whats worrying me its too quiet weve not seen a sign of the yeti since we left those three back there
7076,i dont like it theres something happening on this mountain i can feel it
7077,i thought wed been too lucky
7078,i dont know weve got to get to the tardis somehow
7079,no
7080,hmm
7081,its a robot jamie it merely follows instructions
7082,that we shall have to find out wont we
7083,yes jamie i believe i have
7084,bung a rock at it
7085,jamie i am
7086,there you are you see just as i thought it cant see and it cant feel come on
7087,well its quite all right jamie its like those three back there its either switched off or not receiving come along
7088,well quite frankly no jamie but theres only one way of finding out
7089,no i dont think so jamie yes just as i thought now then
7090,well im glad thats over catch
7091,yes
7092,you mean why didnt they build in some sort of protective device
7093,well perhaps they didnt think it was necessary i mean look at him would you walk up to a creature like that with just a screwdriver in your hand
7094,no there you are im really rather pleased with myself           doctor
7095,jamie
7096,ah splendid splendid its sending out a signal thats just what we wanted
7097,oh no you mustnt do that jamie no
7098,whatever happens you mustnt let go jamie
7099,no
7100,a rock put it in the hole in its chest
7101,yes im all right just a bit puffed thats all jamie these things are programmed to return to their yetis that one that disappeared in the monastery that wasnt taken
7102,what is it
7103,oh no no thats another sort of signal
7104,jamie you dont seem to understand
7105,what a perfect opportunity to trace the main transmitter
7106,not much further
7107,jamie give me the sphere give me the box
7108,move forward very slowly jamie when i say run run run like the wind dont worry about me
7109,now jamie please no heroics jamie
7110,now jamie run run i know what im doing i hope
7111,yes
7112,travers
7113,shh go on
7114,where is victoria
7115,what is this about victoria where is she where are you taking us
7116,all right travers youre quite safe
7117,yes
7118,just relax youre safe in the monastery
7119,what happened where did you go to
7120,you just rest
7121,yes
7122,you just rest youll feel better poor fellow hes completely exhausted
7123,well just let him sleep
7124,shush
7125,i see thomni so here lies north
7126,what are those readings again jamie jamie the readings
7127,the readings
7128,yes i know but theres nothing we can do about her
7129,two ninety seven now that will give us a bearing roughly there
7130,no we want another bearing say from there and where those two cross that will be where the transmissions are coming from but that wont tell us why
7131,yes what is the purpose behind all this thats what we have to find out ay jamie
7132,are you feeling better
7133,you had a spot of trouble on the mountain
7134,yes im sure itll all come back to you in time
7135,let me see
7136,yes victoria
7137,yes yes of course
7138,how long has she been like this
7139,yes victoria
7140,still what do you mean
7141,but that was three hundred years ago its the same man
7142,jamie there is something i have to do
7143,its my voice she reacts to my voice
7144,yes i can but i need more information now you wait here
7145,im going to see a very old friend     padmasambhava
7146,padmasambhava so its true
7147,kept alive i dont understand
7148,what try to tell me
7149,i see you made mental contact with this intelligence
7150,but why
7151,yes of course i will help you but first you must tell me things why are the monks being driven away what is the purpose of these robots the yeti where is their control padmasambhava padmasambhava
7152,not about victoria no but i found some very interesting clues as to whats been happening
7153,yes yes youre quite right victoria must come first trouble is i really need more information however ill just have to take a chance it may just be simple posthypnotic suggestion on the other hand
7154,it may be something worse
7155,well lets just hope it isnt
7156,yes victoria
7157,listen to me youve been taken away youre no longer in the monastery youre safe in the tardis now do you understand youre safe in the tardis yes well look at me look at my eyes youre feeling tired very sleepy drift away let yourself drift away into sleep deeper deeper sleep sleep sleep sleep oh not you jamie
7158,so far so good
7159,no neither did the person who hypnotised victoria
7160,well im tempted to ask her what happened but i dont think i dare probe too deeply the important thing is to get rid of this implanted fear its growing every minute
7161,well we shall just have to do as she asks and take her away if we dont
7162,shell go out of her mind
7163,well thats the object of the exercise to get us away from the monastery but im not beaten that easily
7164,i know what im doing jamie victoria now victoria you can hear my voice cant you
7165,oh good now im going to take you a little way back in the past victoria youre in the cell with thomni do you understand
7166,good now youre going to forget everything after that you went to sleep is that clear good jamie and i have come back to the monastery and you are in the meeting room with us youre feeling happy but a little tired do you understand
7167,good now when i count three youre going to wake up one two three
7168,yes i believe you did ive got work to do
7169,travers travers
7170,how are you feeling
7171,yes i think things are coming to a head
7172,instructions travers can you remember any more of what happened to you on the mountain
7173,are you prepared to risk it again
7174,yes well the monks are but i want to get back up the mountain one more bearing and i shall know where the control centre is
7175,yes if you will
7176,oh theyre leaving with the monks but i want to get out of here before anyone sees us will you help
7177,oh good
7178,i want you to stay here and take some readings those yeti are not transmitting im going over there to stir things up a bit
7179,oh no its far too dangerous i cant ask you to take that sort of risk
7180,no wait
7181,yes
7182,khrisong i have found the control
7183,but you dont understand its here in the monastery
7184,are we are we all here
7185,it was songsten who took this pyramid into the cave
7186,songsten hes the link ive been looking for
7187,then hes in danger
7188,jamie grab hold of him his hands
7189,its all right lie still ill get help
7190,i understand now just try and
7191,he is quite right he is quite right you listen to him
7192,yes but by command unknowingly thomni is right songsten is merely a puppet
7193,now listen to me all of you your abbot is not responsible but neither is padmasambhava he too is controlled now do as youd planned leave the monastery there is great evil here
7194,i will stay here thomni
7195,i have to this things thats here this evil it will spread it has to be stopped and i think i can do it thomni will you help me it will be dangerous
7196,yes i think i can and if we succeed the monks will be able to return
7197,yes victoria i think it best
7198,no i didnt think you would
7199,no wait there are things i have to find out and only songsten can tell me
7200,sit him down here jamie over there
7201,and the yeti
7202,i see now this intelligence it is confined to the cave
7203,no
7204,i see now songsten i want you to help me
7205,now these yeti they are controlled
7206,yes but the control units they were made somehow somewhere
7207,these small yeti models their movements must be mirrored by the real robots
7208,but there must be a control a machine that gives out the orders now where is that control
7209,but i have seen the sanctum
7210,how do i get into it songsten how do i get into it
7211,now as soon as the monks have left we must get into that control room
7212,ill deal with him but remember as soon as were in the sanctum whatever happens thomni and you must smash the controls
7213,padmasambhava will use supernormal powers if necessary for a start hell try to hypnotise you again
7214,thomni youd better teach her the jewel of the lotus prayer itll give her something to concentrate on
7215,jamie where is travers
7216,well hes not here
7217,no i dont somehow think hes done that but id like to know what hes up to
7218,because theyre needed to guard you and the lamas sapan
7219,thank you dont worry everything will be all right when its all over you can come back i hope
7220,i havent the faintest idea
7221,dont worry jamie its going to be all right
7222,well nothing i hope but one of us just might need help are we ready come on
7223,who are you  voice
7224,now  jamie
7225,victoria victoria i cant hold him the models knock over the models no victoria dont let him jewel of the lotus om mane padme hum om mane padme hum
7226,youve got to
7227,jamie jamie jamie yetis coming
7228,the cave jamie there was a pyramid in the cave        voice
7229,goodbye old friend
7230,yes jamie it worked the intelligence is destroyed
7231,yes thomni you can signal the monks they can return
7232,oh no no he was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous brain it wasnt his fault
7233,ah no thomni were anxious to get back to the tar
7234,goodbye thomni
7235,ah they were clever machines almost a pity to have had them destroyed well at least youll have something to take home from your expedition mister travers
7236,it cant be
7237,well that we shall never know jamie whats the matter with you are you cold or something
7238,yes i suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air
7239,what a horrible sight
7240,jamie you never know do you    ltback to the episode listing
7241,whats the matter  jamie
7242,well lets see shall we very careful im going to get out its quite a long drop
7243,come on victoria thats right
7244,youre on my hand
7245,yes thats not ice thats plastic
7246,yes its a dome a protective dome
7247,i know
7248,somethings wrong
7249,were discovered
7250,she doesnt want to know jamie
7251,rather inhospitable weve only just arrived
7252,hush jamie
7253,it sounds like electronic machinery like a computer theres something wrong with its pitch
7254,no
7255,lets go in
7256,seven two point four thats bad
7257,17 degrees well this is serious
7258,one three seven nine excuse me
7259,no were not scavengers
7260,i dont need a computer
7261,no it isnt it doesnt have to happen if youll excuse me
7262,well a quick short burst then from the reactor unit now off now link the circuits with the reactor link now bring in the computer stabiliser yes that should hold it steady its not a perfect job mind you you ought to get an expert in you know
7263,oh no it was near enough correct give or take a second
7264,check it on your precious computer then
7265,well a second out we cant all be perfect
7266,whats the matter
7267,thank you now jamie
7268,look arent we wasting time if you want our help why not tell us all about it
7269,well as a matter of fact weve been in retreat in tibet we are sanctifiers
7270,i see and if i fail
7271,very well fire away
7272,yes
7273,oh possible causes the reversal of the magnetic field
7274,interstellar clouds obscuring the suns rays an excessive burst of sunspot activity a severe shift of the earths angle of rotation
7275,there arent that many alternatives gigantic heat loss
7276,oh oh well in that case the answers simple a severe drop in the carbon dioxide level in the earths lower atmosphere is that it  i would use ionisation
7277,well the carbon dioxide level in the earths atmosphere helps retain the suns heat take that gas away and theres a sudden freeze up
7278,well
7279,up to date
7280,no plants no carbon dioxide
7281,yeah its like a magnifying glass jamie
7282,cant your computers solve the problem of control
7283,well
7284,oh i see and when will that be
7285,whats the position now
7286,and the glaciers will win i see
7287,well im willing to try
7288,only when i have to
7289,oh ill try and remember that
7290,well never mind
7291,frozen for centuries in the ice perfectly preserved ooo thats odd though
7292,well the helmet its wrong when this man was frozen to death only primitive cavemen existed
7293,you see this fellow arden has set the electricity so that the ice melts very slowly allowing for the resistance
7294,well i suspect there are some impurities in the ice i say look at that
7295,its an electronic connection im sure of it
7296,now you wait here and dont touch anything
7297,oh there you are
7298,ive been looking everywhere why dont you label your doors
7299,yes i realise that and im sorry
7300,look i wouldnt intrude if i didnt think it necessary what i have to say is extremely important after all you did ask me to help you didnt you
7301,well it has something to do with that yes
7302,this is serious
7303,thank you its the its the helmet its not what we thought it was
7304,no it has electronic connections
7305,no im positive you realise what this means
7306,yes indeed they even had astronauts it appears
7307,this headpiece is no warriors tinhat its a highly sophisticated space helmet
7308,if this is true your project is in danger
7309,how did he get here well he didnt walk did he
7310,yes and where is that spaceship now
7311,this reactor pile could be exploded or be activated
7312,yes well i thought you ought to know
7313,jamie
7314,strange
7315,for a human being maybe
7316,look at this table
7317,yes but a high current
7318,but if that current passed through a low resistance
7319,yes jamie youre right come on she cant have gone far
7320,but she may be in danger of her life you cant take that decision
7321,its a waste of time asking the computer
7322,come on jamie have patience give it a chance
7323,shush jamie
7324,well he didnt come by shetland pony jamie
7325,yes hes a capable lad
7326,that was from your staff jamies extra
7327,oh good
7328,well i still think you ought to get in an expert why cant you get one
7329,but why
7330,no im here to help you if i choose
7331,this chap penley
7332,temperamental or individual creative scientists have to be allowed some head you know
7333,it couldnt have been just a simple gesture of protest
7334,and your name will suffer thats important
7335,so you do need penley
7336,well ill try and help you but i do think you might try trusting human beings instead of computers
7337,oh thats disgusting its just the thing did you do this
7338,oh hell be all right did you see who did do it
7339,was there a girl there
7340,well why didnt you try and stop them
7341,but shes only a young girl
7342,yes yes i see
7343,no no theyre searching already theres a red alarm all over the base
7344,penley
7345,they need you here you know they need you desperately
7346,theyre your problems too you know its your world
7347,i expect you know what youre doing
7348,oh thank you
7349,goodbye    garrett
7350,with a power pack you mean the one that you used to unfreeze him
7351,no thats what he wants us to do thats why hes taken victoria with him as a hostage no we must let him show his hand first
7352,were not going to only until morning thatll be time enough
7353,you take care of yourself jamie and keep an eye on arden i dont think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is
7354,well hes a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in the air you know what theyre like
7355,good luck
7356,good luck jamie
7357,miss garrett oh no no theres no need to go into formalities
7358,now clent just remember i am not a member of your staff im just a working guest as you might say
7359,your regulations do not apply to me i work in my own way freely
7360,breakdown i thought you said he defected
7361,oh i see
7362,if i was to reverse the sequence to give a density ratio where did i yes here we are if i reverse the sequence to give a density ratio excuse me excuse me yes
7363,mmm yes
7364,four what computer
7365,six yes theyre useful for digital analysis but i very rarely use them except when i have to there is one thing you could do for me which would be very important
7366,lend me a pencil oh that would be even better
7367,now this is wrong this is wrong its not right theres something missing
7368,supposing i what are they
7369,oh computer checked i hope
7370,oh thank heavens for that
7371,what are they omega well what does he mean omega what does he wait a minute wait a minute yes yes of course the omega factor there and here and there yes ha ha your friend penley is very clever
7372,yes thats it
7373,oh when youve been at it as long as i have its nothing
7374,possible its perfect well its nearly perfect
7375,oh itll work all right
7376,computer
7377,i resent that
7378,it should be the other way round
7379,i shall demand an apology you know
7380,well im glad you had time to look up penleys notes
7381,pity that he turned traitor
7382,oh oh its nice to see he still has some friends in the base
7383,how  arden
7384,there is where  arden
7385,isnt it about time that arden and jamie reported again
7386,yes very human im worried about them too
7387,hes not answering perhaps something has happened to them
7388,i will never forgive myself if anythings happened to jamie
7389,oh your ioniser will work all right
7390,what do you mean im only human well as a matter of fact
7391,i told you it would
7392,i told you it would
7393,very likely but somewhere out on that ice face are two young people for whom i have considerable affection that is no triumph
7394,theyre not colleagues theyre friends
7395,ive played mine its finished
7396,arent you forgetting something
7397,no no i dont mean that arden hes not yet completed his mission
7398,what  victoria
7399,can you describe them to us victoria dear  victoria
7400,victoria victoria whats happened are you all right answer me  victoria
7401,victoria victoria can you see the base from where you are  victoria
7402,how does it work
7403,may i theres something i need rather desperately
7404,water
7405,ah thats better now then lets see jamie has vanished
7406,i will
7407,we know these creatures come from mars dont we what do we know about their planets atmospheric conditions
7408,then theyre not going to enjoy this little concoction much are they
7409,well if im going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy
7410,arden fell into a trap i know what to expect
7411,splendid you go instead then
7412,i can be spared ive done all i can here the ioniser will work without me id start getting it ready if i were you
7413,oh youll manage
7414,its as simple as this someone has to get to the spacecraft find out what sort of propulsion unit it has and bring the information back to you or we cant use the ioniser now who better than me
7415,thank you
7416,ah now i dont suppose you have a small radio transmitter
7417,oh well you wont see me but youll hear me as soon as i get to the glacier face ill switch it on and youll overhear i hope
7418,why what else do i need  clent but the warriors are armed
7419,oh i dont think so this is my defence
7420,i think theyll listen to me
7421,that is exactly what im going to do
7422,oh its you again is it
7423,no are you looking for someone
7424,no nobody not even like me
7425,can i help you
7426,well why should i i dont believe everything clent tells me
7427,you know where he is is he hurt
7428,ah wont be long before youre on your feet again jamie
7429,well that depends youve had some sort of shock to your brain its affected your nervous system
7430,oh yes of course you will its just a matter of time thats all
7431,well the base is the only place he can be treated
7432,yes itll flatten this place in no time at all
7433,well thats just it you see i cant go theres something i must do
7434,hes a man with a mission i dont think he can afford to reject you
7435,i must speak with the warriors
7436,i have to see whether victoria got away safely and i must find out whether this spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation programme i admit it wont be easy
7437,their guest i hope jamie
7438,anyone at home
7439,all right all right i dont think much of your hospitality  varga
7440,ah thank you very much thats very civil of you oh my word
7441,no i am sure i can help you on certain conditions
7442,on the contrary it is you who are the prisoner and i can help you
7443,well what good will that do you are buried alive in the heart of this glacier time is desperately short youve got no time to bargain over hostages
7444,weapon but the ioniser is not a weapon
7445,yes of course itll melt the ice and set you free
7446,victoria
7447,its all right we are not beaten yet
7448,hes alive
7449,well there are difficulties
7450,well
7451,no but of your ship if the ioniser sets off a nuclear holocaust it will all have be in vain
7452,well in that case wed have no choice
7453,but it wouldnt harm the ship it would release it
7454,oh i always live in hope
7455,you do realise dont you that after a certain point my base will    doctor
7456,its an ion reactor isnt it hmm it could be dangerous but it wouldnt necessarily explode
7457,now why dont you let us help you
7458,but what else do you need apart from escaping from the ice
7459,well ive told you all i can about the ioniser
7460,why on earth do you want to know that
7461,oh so thats what you need is it
7462,fuel fuel for your reactor and suppose i dont tell you
7463,yes youll find what you need at the base
7464,but you wont find leader clent easy to persuade hes a very obstinate man
7465,its all right victoria dont cry its all right theres nothing to be afraid of
7466,come along victoria blow blow
7467,ammonium sulphide
7468,yes youve had the benefits of a classical education yes it is what youd call a stink bomb
7469,youd be surprised harmless to humans but to aliens very possibly deadly
7470,i cant get it undone
7471,shush  varga
7472,its not just a question of escape victoria weve got to take some action its this gun thats given varga control of the base without it hed be helpless
7473,yes now this is vargas main weapon theres just a chance that i can turn it against him
7474,if i can open these doors there we are come on
7475,well its a little difficult to explain victoria oh oh dear hold this for me will you this gun works on the basis that sound waves produce reverberations in the objects in their path
7476,yes thats right well if you can produce unsympathetic vibrations damage results
7477,yes but i want to be able to get at the warriors without it affecting the scientists too much now if we change this to frequency seven
7478,well primarily it affects fluids
7479,well i believe that varga and his warriors have a far greater fluid content than human beings there
7480,thats just it i dont know
7481,but i do know that whatever effect it has on the scientists itll have a far greater one on the warriors
7482,well thats what im hoping but there is just a vague risk that itll kill everybody clent and penley included
7483,its a risk we must take victoria
7484,now cross your fingers here we go
7485,get well back victoria
7486,stand by for fireworks here we go
7487,oh thank goodness for that now you get back to the tardis and close the doors
7488,no time for questions come along
7489,up you get come along miss garrett there you are
7490,then it must be switched on again immediately
7491,clent their spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor
7492,of course theres a risk but its a risk we must take its the only way
7493,but thats why in this case you cannot rely on its judgement
7494,not this time
7495,because jamie the computer is faced with an insoluble problem either way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do it must play safe
7496,ill explain to you another time jamie
7497,a decision must be taken and quickly
7498,penley its up to you
7499,well penley
7500,oh goodness me
7501,were by the seaside thats where we are thats all that matters
7502,oh stop fussing you two come on
7503,come on in the waters lovely you dont know what youre missing
7504,oh theres nothing like a dip to freshen you up
7505,thats not a boat its a hovercraft
7506,its a hovercraft it floats on the air instead of the sea
7507,no its true jamie
7508,oh yes yes i dont think i like the look of this lets go
7509,come on run
7510,dont argue run come on     the doctor jamie and victoria hide in the grassy dunes
7511,why indeed well what now
7512,no wed never make it theres not much cover here
7513,theyre human beings if thats what you mean indulging their favourite past time trying to destroy each other
7514,you must its our only chance
7515,come on
7516,its a helicopter jamie
7517,a chopper you know a whirly bird
7518,no no no its a primitive form of flying machine
7519,jamie give her a hand
7520,now lets have a look at it youre not and please dont argue victoria bring some warm water will you
7521,go and fetch it will you jamie
7522,come and sit down
7523,well see oh yes
7524,well you went to such a great deal of trouble to save us ah there we are thank you jamie
7525,well not of any medical significance
7526,which law whose philosophies eh
7527,am i
7528,septic spray that should be right
7529,youll run out of doctors in a minute now you havent told us your name yet
7530,ah miss ferrier this is victoria and this is jamie
7531,now this wont take a minute i just want to clean it off be as gentle as i can there we are who are these men why are they so determined to kill us
7532,me im the nicest possible person
7533,they seem remarkably dedicated
7534,there
7535,anything anything at all
7536,oh thats thats comforting anyway what is it that you want me to do
7537,i dont think so miss ferrier no im sorry
7538,theres a great deal of harm in it you dont suppose miss ferrier saved our skins for our sakes do you now what is it you want us for
7539,who is he
7540,salamander
7541,its too late
7542,im not a specimen in a glass bowl you know
7543,oh thank you
7544,well my friends and i weve been out of touch of civilisation for a little while were visitors so to speak on ice shall we say
7545,at the beginning please weve been subjected to a number of attacks because i look like this salamander of yours
7546,i quite agree victoria he seems to be a public benefactor quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome didnt you think so jamie
7547,oh yes well of course weve heard something
7548,yes a rather different principle i think jamie but
7549,you have proof of this
7550,but you could be making up stories about salamander out of revenge
7551,known by who
7552,well why dont you tell the authorities the police or whatever
7553,surely there is someone you can take your story to
7554,oh i see well it seems we have a problem on our hands whether to believe mister kent or not
7555,oh how
7556,yes i thought thats what we were leading up to
7557,yes theres more to it than that what about the voice
7558,only the accent my dear young lady oh dear now what was it he said  we still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all no guarantee no no guaran guarantee you see its very difficult of course i always was interested in phonetics holidays summer summer he must have come from mexico quintana roo or yucatan i shouldnt wonder
7559,yes there are other very strong influences though oh i could do it in time but what if i did what then
7560,i didnt it would take three weeks perhaps four
7561,but thats out of the question
7562,but isnt there another way out of this
7563,yes
7564,i wont i cant
7565,no no wait a minute why is a man like bruce coming here dont push me
7566,you sent for him didnt you you tipped him off
7567,why hello bruce what are you doing here huh
7568,thats what you were meant to believe
7569,i do not care to be questioned by my own security
7570,you have a policemans mind bruce
7571,sometimes i like to deal with matters in my own way
7572,holding me
7573,no one threatens salamander
7574,yes of course you shall have it but not now when i return from the central european zone
7575,i am prepared to accept his story
7576,thats interesting but not important i accept it thats all that matters
7577,you still dare to question me they have information i shall get it i will see you on my return now leave me
7578,must be the way you look jamie
7579,thank you
7580,i dont know where you stand mister kent but you and this salamander are obviously on opposite sides that at least is clear but which side is good which side is bad and why should i interfere
7581,just a moment jamie youre unusually quiet what do you think
7582,how do you propose we do that
7583,that man bruce said that he was in the central european zone
7584,well what then
7585,oh thats very clever of you how can you do that i thought you said you had no official position
7586,he must be a very important person
7587,oh i see what about me
7588,yes yes but from a safe distance of course
7589,oh yes
7590,disused yeti
7591,good luck astrid jamie and victoria will look after you
7592,well im sorry
7593,but why make earthquakes
7594,what youre saying is that salamanders found a way of harnessing the natural forces of the earth its a little difficult to accept im not saying its impossible mind you you say its coming from the research station salamanders research station eh
7595,what made you suspicious
7596,but thats valuable evidence
7597,a sort of jekyll and hyde character perhaps our mister salamander itll be interesting to see what report jamie brings back
7598,i hope theres plenty of air in here
7599,unpleasant yes destructive but not necessarily evil
7600,it is too important i must be sure oh dear what pretty crockery this is sad really isnt it people spend all their time making nice things and other people come along and break them
7601,facts kent i must have facts thats what i hope jamies going to bring back
7602,patience mister kent patience
7603,oh perhaps her plan to infiltrate into salamanders organisation has failed
7604,cant you contact her
7605,well your friend benik did indicate we werent entirely welcome here you know
7606,oh thank you well i suggest we give her another hour and then if she doesnt contact us by then well move out and find out what has happened
7607,but what are they going to do to jamie and victoria
7608,what to his headquarters the research centre
7609,how far will he go to get it
7610,oh thats very comforting
7611,yes im not quite clear about your part in all this you work for salamander suddenly you fall over yourself to betray him
7612,why
7613,oh no no no of course not my dear well nobodys perfect kent but i still cant help wondering why
7614,well you were in a unique position to do so
7615,proof proof proof it always comes back to the same thing no one has any evidence against salamander
7616,not enough its not enough salamander covers up too well
7617,but thats wonderful let me see ill give it to you back thank you
7618,but im afraid this still isnt evidence its not real evidence
7619,oh im not saying that
7620,but i still dont know if i can carry it off
7621,yes
7622,oh i see yes of course there are conditions arent there you help me i defeat salamander
7623,what you really want me to do is to kill him isnt it
7624,private justice eh oh no no ill expose him ruin him have him arrested but i wont be his executioner no one has that right
7625,no
7626,you cant bargain with peoples lives like that
7627,why
7628,well what is it
7629,well isnt there another way out of here
7630,more down there too
7631,whats that
7632,but where does it go
7633,oh no what about you
7634,but i still dont understand whats happened to fariah
7635,well we must find her you dont seem to realise how vital it is
7636,sorry
7637,yes its not bad
7638,well perhaps its fariah
7639,i beg your pardon
7640,but thats ridiculous i couldnt possibly do that
7641,well well yes
7642,because salamander holds my two friends prisoner i was going to attempt to rescue them
7643,we do hold evidence that salamander isnt quite so pure and white as hes painted
7644,a file containing certain information about a gentleman called fedorin
7645,fariah has it salamanders food taster
7646,dead but how
7647,please mister kent youre forgetting one very important thing
7648,me without me you havent got an earthly chance of getting in that control centre
7649,i told you before i will not have anything to do with violence
7650,no i am not may i
7651,please just trust me
7652,its all right mister bruce isnt going to shoot anyone are you
7653,because i think i know what sort of man you are honest and reasonable
7654,i gave you back that gun because i trust you now i want you to trust me
7655,well im afraid you will have to make up your mind to that right away
7656,your confidence
7657,i think theres reasonable doubt about salamanders personal integrity but theres only one way to get proof
7658,yes and my two young friends may have some information
7659,then youll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in prison wont you
7660,and whats that
7661,oh victoria dont hit me you wouldnt hit your old friend the doctor would you i wouldnt leave you in the tender mercy of salamander
7662,you dont believe me oh
7663,well its a little place that we three have in common you must admit they thought i was salamander to begin with
7664,no but theres enough doubt in your mind to make you go on asking questions isnt there thats why we came here
7665,yes thats what i believe
7666,im sure well find proof in the records room
7667,ah well we shall have to wait until he comes out wont we hmm
7668,really benik im beginning to wondering why i pay you such a monstrously high salary worrying me over trifles make your own decision is that all
7669,what now
7670,oh very well
7671,yes
7672,yes
7673,im going mad i left it in there what a fool
7674,yes do that will you right away oh please dont wait for these
7675,i dont know
7676,i hope not but hes done us a good turn in bringing me these thisll interest you bruce how many people do you say work in the research centre
7677,a dozen eh will you tell me why thirty people are catered for here
7678,this is salamander i want a security escort to come to the interrogation room immediately i am releasing two prisoners they are to be conducted to the main gates and set free is that understood good
7679,is the is the pass in order very well you have my authority
7680,we have a visitor now bruce youre going to get your proof but i want you to do one thing
7681,i want you to take my two friends to the gates and see they get away all right
7682,you are to go straight to the tardis as soon as you can
7683,shh
7684,well thats very interesting mister kent why didnt you tell me that before
7685,oh im afraid it is oh look heres another surprise for you look behind you
7686,you see kent
7687,you didnt fool me kent
7688,any man who resorts to murder as eagerly and as rapidly as you must be suspect you didnt just want to expose salamander you wanted to kill him and take his place
7689,stop him stop him hes going to try and blow the place up
7690,no dont touch that door its red hot
7691,well its locked theyre trying to burn through from the other side
7692,it looks like some sort of cave
7693,yes i wonder if he knows kents on his way
7694,they may have been killed
7695,theres a tv monitor screen in there there must be a link to the deep shelter
7696,oh good thats splendid ill come too
7697,oh yes oh
7698,no im all right ill come with you as far as the gates come on we must go
7699,quite right jamie
7700,and giles kent
7701,were going to put you outside salamander no friends no safety nothing youll run but theyll catch up with you
7702,victoria jamie hold onto something
7703,thats it victoria hold on whatever you do hold on
7704,no no youre not ive got hold of you dont look out there concentrate on holding on
7705,yes you can thats the style
7706,all right but watch the tardis doesnt lurch again
7707,well done
7708,you know the switch
7709,its all right theyre closing
7710,oh yes i think so salamander started the tardis without first closing the door he was sucked out
7711,im very glad you didnt hes not in a very enviable position you know at the moment floating around in time and space now then where shall we go
7712,cant control it
7713,well see about that well see about that
7714,yes i wonder      anne
7715,now jamie if that light had come on wed have landed wouldnt we
7716,but were still travelling arent we so how could it have done
7717,what
7718,oh yes very sophisticated victoria go on jamie dont you
7719,what
7720,i see are you two playing some sort of game
7721,well then we are landing arent we
7722,now shush the scanner that will tell us
7723,i dont know something strange has happened were suspended in space
7724,power
7725,control
7726,flight
7727,there you are you see i was right it is all working
7728,just a minute victoria if the time lock has slipped
7729,i dont know but something or someone is holding us here
7730,oh oh yes thatll do jamie i think just get that in there and thatll be excellent there we are that should work
7731,oh nothing
7732,well nothing yet but it will do once we start moving again
7733,yes of course we will victoria you see whatevers holding us must let go sometime
7734,right now jamie give me a hand while theres still time plug this in
7735,plug it in there yes thats right now listen both of you as soon as we land whatever you do dont let go hold on
7736,there now hold tight
7737,well ive managed to move us on a bit not very far perhaps half a mile from where we were expected to land for the moment we have eluded our captor look at the scanner both of you
7738,i really dont know victoria shall we go out and have a look
7739,oh i shouldnt think so for a moment jamie i think were going to need torches
7740,it could be the dungeons of a castle
7741,ah steps come along be careful
7742,what have you found victoria
7743,covent garden oh yes of course its an underground station were standing on the platform
7744,trains underground trains a little after your time i think victoria
7745,no no no its probably the middle of the night come along lets go up top therell be lots of light up there funny isnt it
7746,how we keep landing on your earth
7747,just a minute just let me get my breath those stairs
7748,well thats strange
7749,yes
7750,oh it is quiet i see what you mean the middle of london there should be some noise
7751,yes go on
7752,yes yes now come along
7753,but weve got to get above ground victoria now lets try the next station come along
7754,jamie no dont move dont touch the rails
7755,whatever you do stand still stand still dont move keep quite still jamie
7756,if there had been a current running through these rails youd have been fried
7757,electrified brunched burnt up now come along its safe now i think but wed better be careful follow me
7758,just confirming something yes just as i thought there havent been any trains here for some time
7759,its a power cable i wonder what its doing down here
7760,no i think wed better tread carefully lets go and find out whats going on first
7761,you follow the soldiers but keep out of sight im going to see where this cable goes to meet back here in a few minutes all right
7762,victoria
7763,well
7764,well you see victoria
7765,well yes where is jamie victoria
7766,travers what do you mean travers
7767,me
7768,come along victoria
7769,yes yes im quite all right victoria i was just knocked out by the explosion a bit thats all
7770,well i dont know when i came to there was no sign of the yeti so i wandered around for a bit and then as i was on my way back to you he suddenly popped out from nowhere
7771,when i saw the yeti i put two and two together and then now you say travers is here well
7772,yes i was wondering when you where going to get around to me
7773,who
7774,my word it is its been a long time
7775,oh shes on my staff
7776,yes well as i say when i came to there was no sign of the yeti so i wandered around a bit got lost and saw the fungus
7777,not me then
7778,from what victoria said you had one or two suspicions about me
7779,but why thats what i cant understand why
7780,but how thats what i cant understand what brought the intelligence back again
7781,yes
7782,oh dear
7783,dont tell me it just disappeared
7784,yes well presumably once the sphere started working the intelligence just homed in on it
7785,this mist does it do anything i mean is it poisonous or anything
7786,any sign of the yeti by this date
7787,ah yes my word i thought i wasnt mistaken those yeti have changed in appearance look
7788,its a sort of mark two isnt it
7789,i wonder how the intelligence managed that
7790,sorry
7791,have you had any success against it yet
7792,what about telephones
7793,well as far as i can see what we most need is time now if we were to blow the tunnel here just above goodge street we could seal ourselves in for a bit
7794,ive thought of that got anything on wheels something that will run along a track
7795,well its simple enough we lay the explosives on the trolley and set a triggering device and then blow it up while its on the move
7796,come on travers lets fix up this detonator
7797,ah there you are victoria ive been looking for you everywhere oh my word that looks familiar it doesnt work does it
7798,ah good fine this should do the trick its both timing and contact
7799,yes just push the trolley down the gradient and that should give you enough time to get clear
7800,well if it comes into contact with anything itll blow up at once
7801,did you see inside
7802,theres only one way of finding out isnt there
7803,the yeti have dealt with the explosives here and im willing to bet theyll do the same with those at holborn as well
7804,i think youre wasting your time now colonel
7805,will i
7806,someone here is in league with the yeti maybe even controlling them
7807,the main door didnt open by itself did it it may be any one of us
7808,perhaps
7809,oh
7810,whats the matter with him
7811,well hes too late theyve already left wait a minute why doesnt he want them to blow up the tunnel
7812,you didnt tell him about the tardis did you
7813,yes i do think
7814,there you are its locked victoria
7815,wait
7816,jamie have you seen chorley
7817,have you seen anyone leave headquarters here
7818,right come along no time to waste
7819,come on ill tell you as we go
7820,yes certain of it why else would he lock us in
7821,no no no if he did it doesnt matter does it come along this way
7822,this looks familiar its around this corner
7823,no victoria im afraid we cant
7824,thats what im wondering did he reach the tardis before the fungus or did he not
7825,i dont know
7826,its all right jamie im not going to do anything silly i just want to try and get a little bit for analysis
7827,its all right victoria has anyone got a box
7828,oh splendid
7829,never mind
7830,hold the tin for me would you evans
7831,hold the tin underneath there we are now back everyone quickly
7832,any luck at holborn
7833,come on jamie ill just show this bit of fungus to travers
7834,lets see jamie
7835,good lord thats yeti
7836,no
7837,quiet victoria
7838,yes yes i think shell be all right evans get a chair for her will you get her up jamie come along its all right its all right now anne sit down
7839,its all right now
7840,yes theyve gone now its quite safe now
7841,jamie youd better get her to the common room
7842,you go too victoria
7843,lie her down
7844,have what
7845,yes im very much afraid they have but why why didnt they just kill him unless
7846,well unless they had a use for him
7847,well the yeti broke in while we were out looking for chorley
7848,well im not quite sure
7849,well the answers simple they came for something and they got it
7850,well travers
7851,yes and were the flies all right but where is the spider
7852,i doubt it
7853,yes so has chorley id say he was a much more likely suspect
7854,on the other hand of course whoever is in league with the intelligence could still be amongst us here
7855,well i wish i could give you a precise answer perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless shapeless thing floating about in space like a cloud of mist only with a mind and will
7856,i wish i knew the only thing i know for sure is that it brought me here
7857,yes well i dont think theres any harm in telling you now i have a craft that travels in time and space
7858,well yes but its at covent garden
7859,its a police box
7860,yes yes i could but i have to stay here and finish travers work
7861,very good jamie excuse me gentlemen please
7862,no the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him im afraid your fathers been taken by the intelligence the only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source
7863,yes i know tell me what was your father working on just before the yeti broke in anne
7864,but dont you if he was near to success
7865,well its a possibility isnt it now anne do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory
7866,no no you just take it easy jamie come along
7867,oh yes yes this seems to be in order anne
7868,very wise lets have a look at this
7869,yes this should control the sphere all right but would it override the commands issued by the intelligence i wonder
7870,we can do it if youve got the right bits and pieces
7871,whered you get this
7872,but this is what brought the yeti to the explosives store its obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device and youve given it to me
7873,thank you
7874,dont look so unhappy were all under suspicion you know including me
7875,its the fungus from the tunnel i thought if we examined it it might give us a clue i must get this dismantled its like holding a time bomb
7876,now youd better stand back anne
7877,this fungus is an unknown quantity you know
7878,oh jamie what is it
7879,on his way where
7880,hes wasting his time
7881,shush now look get behind me both of you and keep clear here we go
7882,the tins empty evans
7883,yes yes i know but dont worry about that just at the moment ive been working on this control box of miss travers theres a few more things i need transistors circuits
7884,no not of the right type
7885,well i was wondering if i could go up to street level
7886,theres no mist directly above us here wed have to risk the yeti
7887,itd only take five minutes
7888,well done travers
7889,just one more thing
7890,i just need one more component ill look through here
7891,no no no he didnt steal it the person who did planted it on him
7892,all right all right lets keep our temper shall we the point is two of these were missing now wheres the other one    the ammunition is running out and the yeti take out the soldiers one by one as blake is clubbed down the colonel sprints across the yard jumps the wall and runs for safety
7893,colonel
7894,colonel what happened
7895,all of them
7896,listen listen everyone its the other yeti model its here its somewhere in this room
7897,your pockets
7898,open your pockets colonel quickly quickly come on
7899,they bring the yeti
7900,no no
7901,no anne dont go near him just listen to him
7902,what do you want
7903,yes
7904,oh i see so thats why youve brought me here revenge
7905,and whats that
7906,what do you want
7907,and if i refuse
7908,but you cant
7909,yes i believe you
7910,and if i do submit what of the others
7911,and who are they
7912,no jamie no
7913,jamie dont be a fool you dont stand a chance
7914,he left one of those things there to stop us getting away now victoria is quite safe
7915,the intelligence knows that if it harms her i wont cooperate
7916,yes anne it does
7917,yes im sure
7918,jamie
7919,its all right evans if i dont come up with the answer i will give myself up i promise
7920,dont be foolish jamie
7921,she will be your responsibility and when its all over youll just both have to look after me thats all
7922,well if what the intelligence says is true my mind will be like that of a child youll have to look after me until i grow up
7923,dont worry im going to try not to let it happen
7924,i sincerely hope it wont come to that anne
7925,this control box weve got to get it working
7926,then theres no time to lose is there oh come on anne dont give up i need your help
7927,right now hand me that sphere will you
7928,well i havent finished yet now if you detach the germanium crystal strip here and then attach the collector and the emitter
7929,simple
7930,right you get on with that
7931,and ill just check this sphere yes yes that should complete the circuit good i wonder
7932,strange its not picking up the intelligence must be transmitting i wonder why its not working    aha success its going anne
7933,come along
7934,help you in a minute
7935,careful shut the door
7936,why whats happened
7937,well im not surprised i thought the intelligence would try to hem us in
7938,come on anne we must get to work
7939,well the sphere itself it wont
7940,no but it will help us to test the control box
7941,all
7942,wasted we havent been wasting our time
7943,right anne lets get on with this control box
7944,nearly ready there now then lets see if it works
7945,yes
7946,hang on a minute
7947,back you come yes the trouble is it only works at very short range
7948,well we know that your control box can stop a yeti now then if i can reprogramme this sphere to obey our verbal commands
7949,how long have we got
7950,no dont shoot
7951,it is now stop
7952,simple i told it to
7953,all right i will move forward stop move to the left stop there you are how about that
7954,but it obeys our commands
7955,well once we get it inside a yeti well have a powerful ally
7956,oh very well anne i shall have to do it myself
7957,no no its far too dangerous
7958,do you think its mutating anne
7959,no perhaps youre right
7960,give me the control box anne
7961,yes
7962,what hold the sphere
7963,yes
7964,dont worry itll work its got to work
7965,dont tell me you were worried would you like to hold this for me now then its all right its quite safe    nearly out there right
7966,weve done it you mean now then with my reprogrammed sphere and your control box we should be able to work him over quite a distance and put your arm down
7967,stop come back here stop anne ive been thinking until we know who else is working for the intelligence everyone must be suspect
7968,well the fewer people who know this chaps on our side the better
7969,i know you are to remain here for do you think a minute will be enough
7970,for us to get clear
7971,you are to remain here for ninety seconds and then resume acting on orders from the intelligence until you are told otherwise is that understood
7972,yes i know
7973,well as a matter of fact ill tell you another time hello colonel
7974,any news of victoria
7975,piccadilly
7976,are they all right
7977,how do you know
7978,arnold
7979,we havent got any time to find out
7980,yes
7981,we cant do anything until we get back to headquarters and then if weve got time well try and increase the range of the control units
7982,come on
7983,no
7984,yes  arnold
7985,him
7986,well you never know do you
7987,i dont know
7988,well unfortunately ive lost track of him
7989,well never mind i want you to take this microphone and keep on calling our yeti to you
7990,youll soon know if you havent got the right one wont you jamie i hope you dont suffer from claustrophobia
7991,hmm
7992,its in my pocket
7993,oh no i must meet the intelligence face to face
7994,what is it
7995,well go on
7996,you mean am i going to give myself up
7997,you believe that
7998,listen
7999,thank you
8000,now dont worry victoria
8001,everythings under control dont be frightened
8002,everything is under control tell her anne you understand
8003,now listen everyone dont do anything foolish i am perfectly all right  intelligence
8004,frightened that something might go wrong
8005,do what he says jamie
8006,you gave your word that no one would be harmed i refuse to submit until you release jamie
8007,dont worry i will do what you say
8008,just get on with it please
8009,i just want it over and done with
8010,no
8011,no you dont understand youll ruin everything no
8012,no no no leave me be you dont understand ive got to stay here
8013,you blithering welsh imbecile why cant you do what youre told
8014,youre just as bad i told you to leave it to me now youve gone and ruined everything
8015,no
8016,oh why didnt they leave it to me i had crossed those wires on that helmet thing the intelligence wouldnt have drained me i would have drained the intelligence as it is all we got was a crossed circuit
8017,precisely look
8018,no he was just a poor soldier that was taken over he was probably one of the first to disappear
8019,well its still around isnt it ive failed
8020,i doubt it
8021,you dont really think so do you
8022,oh no oh no
8023,oh no
8024,jamie victoria come along its time we left
8025,goodbye
8026,im sorry travers we have to go
8027,covent garden come along come along jamie goodbye travers
8028,well where do we go which is the way to covent garden
8029,come on lets try this way
8030,well not from the yeti no but who knows they might suddenly start the trains again come on
8031,the tardis is perfectly capable of floating you know
8032,oh england undoubtedly
8033,and the white cliffs
8034,no not usually jamie  hey jamie feel that
8035,oh i hardly think so jamie
8036,its just what it says jamie its eurosea gas
8037,no no i shouldnt think so i wonder what that is
8038,no it wont touch it im afraid jamie ah well have to use this
8039,its a sonic screwdriver never fails
8040,i dont know jamie
8041,yes its probably only throbbing from a pump you know
8042,all right victoria now then jamie
8043,victoria jamie you there
8044,would someone kindly tell us where we are please why dont you answer
8045,i think weve been tranquillised victoria
8046,tranquillised
8047,you know in this position its just a little difficult to communicate
8048,eh
8049,i think its all right i think its the antidote
8050,anyway theres nothing we can do about it you know oh yes thank you yes thats better thank you thank you very much yes
8051,i can assure you i was only being curious
8052,you mean communications have broken down
8053,i told you i was merely being curious
8054,oh dear
8055,it wasnt the valve i was interested in
8056,i heard a movement coming from inside the pipes
8057,yes movement dont ask me what it was
8058,but if the pressure is down in the pipes perhaps thats the reason why perhaps marine life has got into the pipes
8059,well perhaps theres a fracture in the pipes a break and somethings got in that way
8060,mister harris i dont wish to appear interfering but dont you think itd be a good idea to turn off the gas at least until youve had a chance to check
8061,why not
8062,he sounds a very silly man
8063,ive got it
8064,do you think you can make it
8065,no hes not are you ready jamie
8066,right
8067,sorry about that jamie
8068,i think hes dutch jamie and i dont think he likes the english very much       baxter
8069,i dont know but were going to find out come on jamie oh victoria no not you
8070,i think itd be better if you stayed back in the bunk room please
8071,its an impeller jamie it pumps gas from the main pipe line out at sea come on
8072,yes yes they all are its a continuation of the pipe we found on the beach
8073,yes its transparent for checking condensation and anything else that might get inside
8074,there it is again jamie can you hear it
8075,your guess is as good as mine theres something inside there  victoria
8076,victoria where are you  victoria
8077,i can smell gas
8078,deep breaths take deep breaths
8079,creature
8080,all right victoria
8081,yes it was locked
8082,excuse me may i say something when i was in the pipe room a short while ago im sure i heard a movement coming from inside the pipe
8083,well the same as i heard on the beach a sort of thumping sound
8084,then why did they hear it out at the rigs
8085,oh this wasnt a mechanical sound
8086,turn off the gas flow at least until youve had a chance to investigate
8087,and blow us with it
8088,well who knows
8089,well im not sure that
8090,i smell gas theres gas in this house
8091,jamie the window quickly
8092,oh no no no
8093,well shes in some sort of coma possibly because of this gas it was toxic
8094,well this isnt natural gas this is the gas we found when victoria was locked in the oxygen room
8095,i dont know what was the matter with her before this happened
8096,did you put it there
8097,theres no marks or abrasions
8098,um
8099,what oh
8100,its still wet
8101,no dont touch it
8102,well in the first place you dont want to get stung like your wife do you and in the second place whoever put it in your file meant you to touch it
8103,by the pipeline
8104,no jamie dont touch it
8105,yes unless it really did move like victoria said
8106,everything in the sea is living jamie
8107,yes well were not taking any chances hold that for me will you
8108,were going to take a closer look at this weed now bring the bag down here right onto the floor thats it now dont let it touch your fingers careful slowly does it mind your fingers there
8109,were going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can move
8110,oh yes i think so yes i dont think theres any panic but id get her under medical supervision if i was you
8111,yes you do that
8112,yes so did i we better make the most of it weve got a lot of work to do back at the tardis she seems to be sleeping peacefully come on       van lutyens
8113,well you see jamie these two cylinders contain a small amount of natural gas it should be quite interesting to see what sort of effect it has on the weed how are you doing victoria
8114,oh yes well thats got the natural iron content
8115,oh yes im not surprised is this hot
8116,you see this rusty stuff here
8117,well it means that the weeds giving out a gas probably toxic
8118,now just a minute jamie im looking at little wriggly things where
8119,jamie this is it theres molecular movement come and see victoria there why thats amazing
8120,yes yes i was afraid it would be
8121,well i told you victoria this is a book of legends and superstitions this particular drawing was supplied by ancient mariners in the north sea in the middle of the eighteenth century jamie
8122,yes i think theres no doubt about it
8123,well theres obviously some connection between the weed and the creatures themselves
8124,gas
8125,jamie jamie help me get the lid on oh no quickly
8126,well thank you victoria yes nobody here its better that way
8127,gas
8128,jamie try the kitchen
8129,weve apparently frightened it away
8130,mrs harris ah oh yes of course mister harris had her taken over to the medical centre at least i hope he did  jamie
8131,the terrace
8132,give me a hand
8133,well you just rest a while
8134,well victoria its the spice of life my dear
8135,is something wrong
8136,are you right jamie come on then
8137,thats where youre wrong mister harris we do know what they are at least i think we do seaweed
8138,yes not the sort that youd normally find on the beach this seaweed happens to be dangerously alive
8139,i think you better listen to me i think youd all better listen to me large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the beaches along this coast seaweed that shows clear indications of having life like human beings
8140,yes i think theres no doubt about it
8141,no wait the weed is capable of protecting itself it gives off a toxic gas its also a parasite it attaches itself to other living things
8142,im afraid i dont know
8143,ah yes but she survived didnt she how is she
8144,oh where
8145,oh dear
8146,what
8147,well weve just come from your quarters your wife wasnt there
8148,yes yes im afraid it is
8149,i dont know i simply dont know
8150,well cant you send someone out to investigate
8151,we can do nothing
8152,oh im sorry victoria did i startle you
8153,wheres jamie
8154,oh good
8155,well im not sure victoria im not sure looks so peaceful out there doesnt it
8156,yes
8157,well we have to wait
8158,now victoria its not as bad as all that you know
8159,well no not exactly
8160,yeti
8161,if you dont mind my saying so mister van lutyens i think this is a very bad idea of yours you dont know what youre up against
8162,i wish you wouldnt do this mister van lutyens
8163,good luck
8164,well we dont know victoria
8165,we cant just leave him down there
8166,were going down there after him
8167,jamie you wouldnt let me go down there on my own now would you
8168,open the airlock
8169,jamie that hole goes straight down to the big gasometer down below
8170,well it must be
8171,shine it down there jamie
8172,no its too dark jamie not a sign of van lutyens
8173,wait a minute
8174,take the lift up
8175,yes i think so
8176,its the weed it must fill the entire shaft it was moving pretty quick too
8177,i dont know
8178,no not unless shed been persuaded to jamie i think wed better go and look for her come on you go that way ill go this way
8179,oh its not that i can assure you
8180,well
8181,im afraid not
8182,yes jamie and i nearly joined him the whole of the bottom of the impeller shaft is covered in weed and foam
8183,im afraid that mister robson is being controlled by some force that emanates from this weed
8184,yes
8185,this is a struggle for power miss jones matter over mind im convinced all these people mrs harris chief robson mister van lutyens have all been overcome in this struggle and goodness knows how many more people
8186,from the human brain its parasitic
8187,i dont know but theyve certainly become part of the colony
8188,with the control rig gone we can draw only once conclusion the weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony
8189,the saturation of the british islands and perhaps in time the entire planet
8190,oh yes unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it
8191,yes that is the difficulty
8192,what is it
8193,all right whats happened
8194,the advance guard
8195,the first part of the invasion
8196,its begun the battle of the giants
8197,your wasting your time miss jones by now all those rigs will have been taken over by the weed colony
8198,the worst im afraid
8199,no we darent do that
8200,well that would spread this menace over a wide area and make it impossible to attack it
8201,no what is the weed going to do
8202,well lets think now i imagine that in the first place the weed was drawn up by one of the drilling rigs
8203,precisely and the engineers who cleared it must have touched it yes
8204,and since then this attack and it is an attack has followed a set pattern
8205,top priority people have been attacked first
8206,yes im very much afraid that is true
8207,oh and whats that
8208,yes thats something thats been puzzling me too but she disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies
8209,now supposing that person was under the control of the weed he was wearing a gas mask for one reason only
8210,exactly mister harris
8211,well its only a theory at the moment
8212,oh how nice to be trusted but i only hope i am right
8213,oh miss jones no im afraid i havent
8214,well i think it has little alternative but to attack us here
8215,because this is the gas distribution centre itll want to gain control of it we must find a way of attacking its nerve centre before it does
8216,thats the trouble we dont know
8217,no but there is something at the back of my mind
8218,yes that is a possibility
8219,yes i was right someone amongst us here is under the control of the weed
8220,yes im afraid so
8221,i dont know thats the difficulty
8222,yes
8223,yes
8224,yes jamie im sure youre right
8225,im sorry to disillusion you jamie but i dont think it was the punch that did it
8226,its beginning to expand like it did in the tardis
8227,no i should have thought of this
8228,im very much afraid so  price
8229,right jamie right back back everyone back come along
8230,well she was here
8231,she was here standing along side you
8232,no
8233,she must have gone through there
8234,the doors
8235,open these doors open these doors try here jamie
8236,theyre not come along
8237,no i was hoping you had
8238,no no no
8239,oh no oh no can i speak to him from here
8240,this one
8241,robson robson robson listen to me can you hear me    doctor
8242,robson robson
8243,well he meant exactly what he said
8244,yes they must think im a serious menace
8245,but of course
8246,jamies right weve got to go after him
8247,miss jones i have a feeling that mister robson is going to lead us to the nerve centre of the colony
8248,yes its foam thats the nerve centre
8249,yes
8250,oh yes we can jamie
8251,oh yes he said hed hang around
8252,i think well go along down here
8253,jamie were already in the lions den what weve got to concentrate on is keeping our heads out of his mouth now come on
8254,theres nowhere else she can be
8255,no jamie jamie now theres no element of surprise  victoria
8256,no jamie
8257,if you were hunting what would you do
8258,might be lets be cautious just in case hey
8259,they need me  victoria
8260,dont you realise what theyve done to you theyre trying to control your mind man  victoria
8261,matter will never conquer mind its against the law of nature
8262,jamie hurry
8263,scream again victoria
8264,come along its time we got out of here
8265,no no i think its all right now the helicopters waiting come along mind the stairs theyre slippery
8266,there it is
8267,probably not
8268,oh jamie help me get this hatchway covered we cant hang around here the helicopter will never see us
8269,theres robsons helicopter in there
8270,ive been dying to get my hands on one of those things come on come on
8271,dont worry victoria well soon be out of it
8272,well were airborne arent we jamie anyway astrid ferrier we watched her fly one of these things
8273,now dont worry victoria its a very primitive machine you know it should be easy to control
8274,well thats strange
8275,well i was always under the impression that you couldnt loop the loop in a helicopter
8276,right rudder  pilot
8277,perhaps i can answer those questions mister harris
8278,well we didnt see her no
8279,you say theres not much hope i believe there is
8280,well on our way back here we stopped of at the medicare centre the man that jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely recovered
8281,yes the weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died hes bemused hes dazed but hes alive
8282,noise sound vibrations
8283,victoria discovered it
8284,well yes you screamed
8285,its her scream her particular pattern of sound that does the trick
8286,yes very possibly now before you evacuate this compound just give me one half hour
8287,we make a noise miss jones we make an awful lot of noise
8288,but weve got to it may be too late
8289,yes but if we can destroy the weeds nerve centre
8290,but we do its here
8291,precisely we must generate enough sound to penetrate the control rig
8292,that way through the pipelines mister harris this is the only way to help your wife and all those other people
8293,please just one half hour
8294,oh thank you now then mister price where do all these big leads go to
8295,i see
8296,well if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound down the pipeline we can destroy the weeds nerve centre
8297,have you got a tape recorder or some such thing
8298,victoria i want you to scream
8299,he will record it make a loop of it so that we can repeat it endlessly
8300,take these magnetised speakers and attach them to the pipeline over there jamie give me a hand
8301,whats the matter victoria
8302,oh no oh victoria thats ridiculous
8303,everything depends upon you screaming
8304,keep away from it keep away
8305,just a few more minutes please mister harris the screams ready
8306,and mister harris
8307,now then ive attached the speakers to the pipeline victorias scream will be put through this
8308,well its a little toy of my own together with the amplifiers yes it should produce a sonic laser sound wave
8309,yes passing through the pipes itll destroy the nerve centre of the weed
8310,well unfortunately no no we have to do battle with that ourselves
8311,with these mister price
8312,if the weed attacks us here we simply point these at it and hope for the best now for heavens sake dont get in the way of the speakers the soundll cut you to pieces
8313,give me the other two lets set up another two
8314,come along no time to waste
8315,here we are thats it
8316,there we are
8317,take this and point it at the monster but dont get in the way of it
8318,back everybody onto the platform here
8319,give it a minute
8320,behind you look behind you the corridor
8321,switch off price switch off now
8322,mister price i think you can switch it all off now
8323,what about
8324,why dont you go and see mister price
8325,miss jones that will be more than sufficient
8326,whats the matter eh
8327,well of course
8328,its all right
8329,its all right theyre safe
8330,theyre safe listen theyre safe come along and see
8331,oh yes
8332,well lots of people have tried
8333,oh really oh dear there we are
8334,well no no as a matter of fact we must be on our way
8335,well we havent quiet decided yet
8336,yes i will
8337,goodbye mister robson well i suppose i think its time we went jamie victoria
8338,you dont want to come with us do you victoria
8339,well i suspected as much
8340,just a minute jamie you mean you want to stay here and settle down well if you want to you must
8341,no thats all right mrs harris i wonder if youd mind if victoria stayed with you for a little while you see shes got no parents or home and it is a bit difficult
8342,there thank you very much jamie and i will stay for another day just in case you want to think again
8343,now jamie she must make up her own mind its her own life its her decision
8344,we are not leaving her jamie it was her decision to stay shell be quite all right with the harrises now dont worry so much jamie
8345,well where would you like to go
8346,i was fond of her too you know jamie  ltback to the episode listing
8347,well where would you like to go
8348,i was fond of her too you know jamie
8349,were landing
8350,lets have a look at the scanner shall we
8351,oh yes we are but i seem to have lost the picture lets try a little bit more power shall we
8352,yes of course i am look at the fault indicator will you its round there on the left
8353,no movement at all
8354,well thats funny the airs all right the temperatures perfectly normal there seems to be rather a lot of metal all around us
8355,there we are its coming up now
8356,well thats funny its changed to night now
8357,oh dear those pictures arent whats happening outside im certain of that
8358,theyre temptations
8359,the tardis is trying to warn us to get away from here to somewhere more pleasant i must have pushed the wrong switch
8360,what
8361,what well the powers overloading the power lines are overloading
8362,the mercurys vapourising weve got to get out of here come on
8363,hold on to me
8364,just hold on
8365,i disengaged the time vector generator
8366,well once removed it alters the size of the tardis the inside becomes an ordinary telephone box again come along come and sit over here
8367,it looks like the motor section of some sort of rocket
8368,oh yes theres an artificial gravity system too
8369,well its what keeps us on our feet otherwise wed be floating around
8370,water no not in here jamie theres no movement either is there
8371,yes i expect so ouch
8372,have a lemon sherbet itll quench your thirst
8373,jamie
8374,look its a track
8375,no no there may be something on the other side here
8376,yes what caused the defence mechanism of the tardis to register danger then and wheres the crew and whats this track theres plenty of air in there lets try and get in
8377,its living quarters here
8378,yes jamie it does it carries four two on duty and two resting
8379,isnt there
8380,matter were just a piece of space flotsam dont you realise that
8381,time vector generator
8382,no its not as simple as that jamie the fluid hmm we need mercury to refill it dont we
8383,yes i hope so
8384,whats happened to the crew they havent just gone out for a little constitutional you know
8385,well ive searched my side theres not a drop of mercury anywhere
8386,well well have a breather and then well try in there
8387,i can give you another lemon drop
8388,what do you fancy
8389,ill see what i can do
8390,roast beef you said
8391,what vegetables
8392,potatoes
8393,and cabbage what about a drop of fruit salad
8394,and ill have some pork potatoes and carrots and ill have a drop of icecream
8395,gravy
8396,yes of course itll be delicious
8397,sit down and eat up
8398,now time is relative jamie if i knew when now was i might be able to hazard a guess
8399,well shes decided to stay in a good historical period very few wars great prosperity shell be happy enough this is very filling isnt it
8400,well when weve digested our dinner well have another try to get into the control room
8401,i dont know jamie i wish i did i suppose theyve been overtaken by some disaster or other perhaps well find out when we get into the control room
8402,yes i know theres someone in the control room
8403,no no jamie weve got to get back to the tardis its the only safe place
8404,never mind that
8405,into the tardis ive got to get him to safety
8406,jamie take this its a gun like a torch you have to be careful
8407,well thats marvellous isnt it the doctor told me to protect it you dont give a reason just leave me to get you out of trouble
8408,oh i suppose so
8409,i was just beginning to enjoy this little rest
8410,i dont know jamie what exactly did happen on the rocket well dont look at me like that
8411,its a bit hazy
8412,i suppose i hit my head
8413,no but its there its there at the back of my mind
8414,machine no but theres something some warning some menace     cyberman 1
8415,oh we keep fit one way and another i suppose all this mean ive got to get up
8416,oh good
8417,well it did but its better now
8418,well just a little
8419,i think youll find my psyche in very good order
8420,oh yes i can perfectly were not saboteurs you know
8421,the last thing we want to do is to interfere with what youre doing here or put you in any danger you saved our lives on that rocket and were very grateful
8422,guard
8423,oh no
8424,i dont think weve met have we
8425,oh oh yes and what do you do here zoe
8426,oh i am impressed
8427,what question
8428,so whats your theory
8429,well its an interesting theory
8430,logic my dear zoe merely enables one to be wrong with authority supposing there was a faulty automatic pilot
8431,well its a possibility
8432,this was found by the body was it
8433,the gordian knot couldnt be untied either
8434,it means theres always a solution
8435,and the bernalium is a writeoff is it
8436,and the xray laser gun the main armament of the wheel relies on bernalium
8437,its a possibility isnt it jamie what do you think
8438,and murders
8439,well its an interesting theory
8440,hmm it doesnt fit this
8441,well we can find out
8442,with the xray machine
8443,simple common sense works wonders sometimes zoe
8444,here we go now lets see what we got
8445,its a cybermat
8446,the lights jamie the lights cybermats
8447,yes and there is only one place where they can be on that rocket      cyberman 1
8448,but cybermen exist youve got to believe me youve got to
8449,they were once men human beings like yourself from the planet mondas but now theyre more robot then man
8450,oh no more than that their entire bodies are mechanical and their brains have been treated neurosurgically to remove all human emotions all sense of pain theyre ruthless inhuman killers
8451,its not rubbish theyll kill anyone who stands in their path youve got to believe me youve just got to    cyberman 1
8452,they already sent their cybermats in to weaken you
8453,oh dear how do you convince a man like that
8454,they will find a way
8455,its an alien machine destructive capable of killing
8456,yes its a pity you didnt tell somebody sooner
8457,yes
8458,meteorites yes now the cybermats must have sent in to destroy the laser gun but
8459,what
8460,you see jamie
8461,yes but why
8462,but the wheel must have other defences
8463,no i think the bernalium was destroyed for another purpose but what what
8464,extraordinary extraordinary
8465,oh im so glad there is no damage miss corwyn
8466,oh oh forgive me
8467,oh im so sorry
8468,gemma how nice gemma tell me tell me about the controller jarvis
8469,hes a strange man to be in a position like this
8470,are there any ordinary circumstances in space
8471,yes thats a very accurate
8472,youre very perceptive
8473,dont you
8474,exactly one does wonder what a man like that will do when faced with a problem for which he has no solution
8475,of course i have to get up
8476,now gemma be reasonable i know the dangers the cybermen need to colonise they must have the treasures of earth
8477,hes not in control of himself
8478,oh oh thank you you will tell the guard wont you
8479,i see
8480,do you have any coffee
8481,id love some i really would
8482,thats better than nothing
8483,oh yes of course
8484,no jamie i havent forgotten im worried about the tardis if im right and those cybermen are whats going on
8485,whats going on zoe
8486,i wouldnt dream of contradicting you can you repair the laser gun in time
8487,oh dear hes getting worse
8488,why arent you worried about the laser gun i thought all of the bernalium has been destroyed
8489,oh good
8490,ah what what did you say
8491,gemma gemma did you know about this bernalium from the rocket
8492,dont you see what it means the cybermen are here they came over in that crate
8493,but they didnt know what they were doing they were just obeying orders
8494,yes something like that
8495,yes but a psychotropic drug is only effective against a known enemy have you induced repulsion in all parts of the brain yet
8496,how can we check
8497,i see
8498,yes yes please is that all right
8499,er can we pin it down to an individual
8500,no stop him
8501,yes good
8502,right
8503,were going hunting jamie
8504,a very good question come on
8505,what is it
8506,jamie i know now shush
8507,yes this is it
8508,its a false bottom you see
8509,its so easy
8510,i dont understand them
8511,destroying the wheel jamie thats what im talking about from the outside its strong enough but now that the cybermen are inside
8512,well they obviously dont want to destroy the wheel
8513,i wish i knew the first thing we must do is to protect the people here
8514,whats the thing which we need to survive which the cybermen dont
8515,always thinking of your stomach arent you no air jamie air now i wonder how this works       doctor
8516,listen to me very carefully do as i ask and dont delay one of the cybermats is very close to us itll tune into our brain waves at any minute
8517,hook up a variable audiofrequency on this channel right away do it at once
8518,were coming back as fast as we can this is what youve saved us from
8519,not necessary complete catatonic features certainly
8520,is the equipment here
8521,oh i wouldnt advise moving him youve thrown a magnetic forcefield round this section
8522,enough to keep the cybermen out
8523,no its no good youre second in command you must take over
8524,well im not surprised you cant get in touch with the rest of the wheel
8525,with the metal plates you mean has everybody had them fitted to the back of their necks
8526,well it would be advisable to have it done
8527,well it would be as well not to miss then wouldnt it
8528,i think it is reasonable to assume that the cybermen caused that star to go nova
8529,no not to destroy the wheel to make you want to use the laser then they sent in their cybermats to attack the laser and destroy the bernalium
8530,with the cybermen inside it
8531,it was only way they could get into the wheel
8532,so you see this isnt just an attack by an alien race on a space station the cybermen have another purpose
8533,they have an overriding ambition to invade the earth plunder its mineral wealth and somehow they see a way of doing it through this wheel
8534,i dont know
8535,hmm yes jamie the time vector generator from the tardis where is it
8536,yes yes where is it
8537,are you sure
8538,but i havent got it
8539,important someonell have to go over to the rocket to get it
8540,well if gemma can spare someone to show you how to make the journey
8541,yes of course youre the only one who knows what it looks like besides me and im much too busy besides its your fault that its lost
8542,well isnt it
8543,she she agreed to go
8544,i had to jamie will look after her
8545,well they knew the risk zoe calculated it
8546,good
8547,yes  corwyn
8548,gemma can you hear me gemma gemma
8549,gemma
8550,what about jamie and zoe
8551,zoe calculated the risk lets hope she was right
8552,any signs of jamie and zoe
8553,do you think i dont know that it was a calculated risk that had to be taken
8554,because theres something on board that rocket that weve got to have if were going to beat the cybermen
8555,yes to save many but anyway were all going to get killed shortly unless you switch over to sectional air supply
8556,the cybermen are going to poison the air
8557,gemma told me
8558,shes in the oxygen room
8559,no no well you cant shes dead
8560,well thank heavens hello wheres jarvis
8561,no wait youre too late look
8562,that remains to be seen
8563,but they wouldnt go to all this trouble just to knock out one small space wheel
8564,it could be a cyberman spaceship
8565,possibly
8566,excuse me tell him i will go for the spares
8567,i think that its essential that i go
8568,now listen as soon as flannigan comes through the force field grab him
8569,i somehow dont think he will now please do as i say ill have the map now remember dont trust him check the metal plate on the back of his neck
8570,ah mercury
8571,i suppose youve come for me  cyberman 1
8572,yes but theyre sending in reinforcements probably through the loading bay have you got the rod thank you im going to try and fix this into the laser gun circuit with any luck i should be able to boost the power enough to destroy the cyberman spaceship but youll have to hold them off at the loading bay i need time
8573,well theres still a cyberman left so watch out for him
8574,good heres a metal plate for vallance
8575,yes all right
8576,yes ive even got some mercury left over
8577,yes i think
8578,now jamie its not impossible its something that we have to decide you may change your mind
8579,i wonder zoe watch the screen up there
8580,im going to show zoe the sort of thing that she may be in for
8581,yes only im going to weave them into a complete story for you have you ever heard of the daleks
8582,then watch  dalek
8583,oh yes oh yes ahh
8584,yes just a little bit weary jamie its a very exhausting business projecting all those mental images you know
8585,yes we all do a nice holiday
8586,yes its an island on dulkis a perfectly splendid planet
8587,no no no of course not theres nothing unpleasant on dulkis
8588,oh no goodness me no theyre a very advanced race the dulcians and theyre very gentle too and friendly youre going to like them
8589,oh yes jamie blow that up for me would you
8590,yes some time ago mind you it was splendid it was so peaceful i just didnt want to leave
8591,well yes zoe they but dulcians are gentle and friendly
8592,oh no no no this was caused by an explosion some time ago jamie
8593,yes i think youre right zoe but i dont understand it lets look inside shall we
8594,yes youre right again zoe a war museum
8595,oh yes but these are very old fashioned weapons jamie this sort of thing was banned ages ago
8596,no jamie no put that down
8597,well its a sort of laser gun you know what thatll do itll burn a hole through anything metal concrete wood anything it may look old but well you never know it just might go off now please just leave things as they were where was it
8598,well that seems to be something
8599,stay here zoe come on jamie
8600,theyre dummies
8601,huh
8602,thats just what i was thinking zoe i think i did i yes im sure i did
8603,yes yes i think youre right zoe
8604,but but but why on dulkis theyve outlawed war there must be some other explanation
8605,oh my beautiful coat is all wet
8606,all this is totally unnecessary you know theres not a trace of contamination on us
8607,whats odd about it
8608,have you checked
8609,well if i were you id take them now
8610,but but i was hoping you were going to tell us that
8611,but atomic weapons on dulkis i thought war had been abolished here
8612,well as jamie was about to say we come from a different world from a different time
8613,but when i was here some time ago you were a peaceful race what
8614,well yes
8615,well well whats happened to you i thought aggressive weapons had been abolished
8616,then what are you doing letting off atomic devices all over the place
8617,i see then this is an atomic test site
8618,no i wonder why
8619,but why do you think we might be responsible thank you
8620,tardis
8621,oh it would have registered
8622,i havent
8623,eh i dont think
8624,i dont know look ive never seen this gentleman before in my life
8625,you say youve seen a spacecraft
8626,what exactly did this spacecraft look like
8627,are you sure it wasnt square like a large wooden box
8628,jamie wed better go and see
8629,i prefer to make up my own mind thank you jamie are you coming zoe
8630,right we shant be a minute
8631,are you sure theres no radioactivity
8632,good
8633,thats a relief jamie come and have a look at this its interesting look
8634,see
8635,well i think it must be some sort of survey mark
8636,jamie look
8637,lets follow them shall we
8638,now that really is interesting
8639,oh this is interesting yes obviously an interstellar spaceship of considerably advanced design
8640,that i think jamie depends upon what you think i am thinking
8641,stop it
8642,jamie dont do it
8643,oh my word
8644,oh good heavens
8645,now jamie
8646,jamie
8647,do what
8648,dont struggle jamie keep still
8649,shush jamie i am trying to listen
8650,i think theyre arranging for some sort of tests
8651,i dont know i thought i heard them mention the word intelligence
8652,yes or how stupid i wonder which is the more important to them
8653,hes arranging some sort of intelligence test jamie
8654,yes well you have to put the right shapes into the correct holes its quite simple
8655,yes thats whats bothering me its too simple
8656,im free what about you
8657,come on
8658,what are you going to do with us
8659,oh thank you
8660,oh oh no
8661,oh my hands
8662,yes im all right
8663,an unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one jamie
8664,just act stupid do you think you can manage that
8665,oh
8666,oh but
8667,but every time we try and get up theres a
8668,jump jump
8669,elec elec
8670,all right well go
8671,well well its some sort of gun isnt it
8672,well i dont know that
8673,hmm
8674,oh oh i see well guns kill people is that what you wanted to know
8675,well i dont think i you have to put something into it first and it comes out here as far as i remember
8676,jamie jamie be careful
8677,jamie be careful
8678,yes it was the clever ones who invented them
8679,yes they lived long ago you see there arent many of them left they stopped us using guns and things
8680,yes
8681,well there are there are not many we dont like them much they tell us what to do you see
8682,oh yes sir
8683,me too theyre a bloodthirsty lot these dominators arent they
8684,i dont know that message they sent material readily accessible some sort of mineral deposits do you think
8685,well what do they want the dulcians as slaves for theyve got the quarks
8686,yes i think youre right
8687,oh this is splendid
8688,well then where is she she did arrive safely
8689,oh ive no idea jamie but the dulcians wouldnt have harmed her of that im certain
8690,what
8691,its not necessary you see jamie this is a society of total pacifism
8692,no no
8693,but cully has told you they were murdered and i believe him
8694,because i have seen these dominators we were taken aboard their spacecraft believe me theyre callous without pity
8695,and when these horrible tests were over they just let us go
8696,i would like to make a suggestion i know it is the way of dulkis to discuss and to deliberate but the situation is urgent send someone to the island to confirm what weve told you
8697,because they are aggressive callous and unfeeling dont expect them to act and think as you do theyre alien from another world
8698,oh dear youve got me there
8699,well im not sure but i heard them say that the material was readily accessible probably some kind of mineral ore
8700,yes but then theres the matter of the disappearance of the radioactivity from the island that could be significant
8701,i told you jamie there are no weapons on dulkis
8702,jamie has a point there you know now i suggest you try to get in touch with balan on the island again he must know more by now
8703,ah
8704,its no use
8705,its too late
8706,its a robot
8707,yes now perhaps youll believe me
8708,what do you mean
8709,yes right
8710,no jamie not exactly oh dear this is rather complicated
8711,well jamie as you said this capsule is homing straight back onto the survey unit and the quarks are there
8712,yes i know thank you now dont worry all ive got to do is to override the automatic pilot
8713,ah no no jamie there dont seem to be but the simplest way is to get straight at the control mechanism
8714,yes now its all right jamie just leave it all to me the trouble is all the wires seem to be leading up into the nose just hold this for me for a minute will you jamie lets see whether i can scramble through here just wait a minute were nearly there oh
8715,ive nearly got it jamie yes i think ive got it
8716,well there wont be time for another try you know oh give us a hand pull me back
8717,well at least we know it works dont we
8718,of course i can ill get us down in no time at all
8719,now just hold on     councillor 2
8720,oh no bones broken oh dear oh there we are oh my word ah well i think weve done rather well so far dont you
8721,it was just a bit bumpy oh now then the main thing is we werent spotted now come along weve got to find zoe and the others
8722,its the ruined building hello
8723,weve got to get down there jamie well split up and get around the back of them ill cut across those cliffs
8724,oh but i do whenever i see one i go away but theyre all over the island where can i go
8725,but jamie was in that building
8726,all right all right
8727,a little internal dispute i fancy oh dear
8728,well im not sure
8729,no
8730,yes yes yes so you did
8731,yes yes senex is at the capital
8732,well you cant the terminal at the survey unit was destroyed wasnt it
8733,but are you going to take your own craft to the capital
8734,well actually now i come to think of it i do know where there is a capsule i didnt tell you about it before because im not sure that it works it has some loose wires and things but im sure that youll be able to fix it
8735,oh dear i dont
8736,well actually now i come to think of it if you were to take out one of the seats a quark might fit inside
8737,oh yes
8738,dont worry zoe the effect soon wears off
8739,well if he takes this craft we wont be able to investigate it will we
8740,to find out what sort of power unit it has then we can tell what the dominators are looking for on dulkis besides if they take us to the capital we wont be able to search for jamie will we
8741,yes
8742,there you are you see all right its all right
8743,of course
8744,why didnt you tell me about this underground shelter before
8745,well its possible its possible
8746,well i think
8747,oh yes all right
8748,i dont know we must find out exactly what theyre drilling for
8749,yes if only we could create a diversion for a moment
8750,only one person heres strong enough to do that
8751,yes alive and kicking by the sound of it this is just what we needed now theres no time to waste
8752,well nows our chance to investigate the power unit and find out what fuel this ship carries
8753,yes must be pretty powerful too
8754,oh i do i do i do zoe now where do you think the power cells are located
8755,no ultrasound has no horsepower as such
8756,no more likely to be electromagnetic probably produced by ah yes here we are zoe help me to get the inspection cover off
8757,no no not exactly but its radioactive material of some sort zoe this is a storage unit that accounts for the strange disappearance of the radioactivity from the island this unit sucked it up and stored it
8758,yes er balan oh  balan can you remember where the scientists who exploded that first atomic device got their materials from
8759,but perhaps thats why theyve chosen this place the magma the molten core of the planet could that be radioactive
8760,its these drill holes that intrigue me one at each corner of a square and one directly in the middle but why why
8761,hmm
8762,theyre drilling
8763,hmm oh i dont think they want to take anything out of the earth zoe rather put something into it
8764,well if im right oh no
8765,that was very rash of you jamie those quarks are appallingly dangerous
8766,im afraid not nowhere on the island is safe nowhere on the entire planet come to that
8767,im afraid they do
8768,a large amount of fuel for their invasion fleet
8769,theyre not mining for minerals or any natural fuel source
8770,but there was no reactor in their ship of theirs only a radiation storage unit you remember how when they landed it sucked up all the radioactive dust from the island
8771,exactly
8772,look ill show you
8773,well dont you see theyve chosen this spot because the crust of the planet is thin theyre going to fire the rockets through the crust into the magma the molten core
8774,exactly
8775,yes thats right zoe the whole planet will become one vast molten mass of radioactive material the fuel store for their fleet
8776,oh jamie its not as simple as that is it if only i could get hold of that atomic seed device i might be able to defuse it
8777,yes
8778,yes thats the problem
8779,shush a minute jamie im trying to think
8780,yes
8781,but jamie its a brilliant idea its so simple only you could have thought of it
8782,yes theres only one snag though could we complete the tunnel in time itd have to be twelve feet long or more
8783,yes thats true but youve been lucky so far if only i could devise some sort of weapon for you is anything down here cully
8784,medical kit oh its surprising what you can do with a few simple chemicals and a little ingenuity now come on we must dig this tunnel zoe give us a direction will you
8785,right we start there tunnel there get that bunk away come on
8786,i think youd better let me start it jamie
8787,its a little more than a screwdriver just watch this
8788,hang on jamie this is ready now if this works you should have a good chance of distracting the quarks and maybe even destroying one or two of them right come on zoe lets try it
8789,yes in here there you are just a bit
8790,whoa whoa thatll do now then jamie all youve got to do is to add one of these little number nine pills to each bottle just before you throw it like that
8791,what
8792,no no jamie that was just a small quantity but with ten times that amount you should have quite a handy little bomb
8793,oh dear its obviously going to take quite a disturbance to stop them drilling teel teel how far have you got
8794,teel come out and take your rest zoe your turn come on
8795,it sounds as though theyre having great fun
8796,yes but they must be nearly finished by now
8797,no theyre still up there unfortunately theyre taking
8798,yes
8799,yes i know i can hear it up there we must be pretty near
8800,my word lucky indeed come along down you come all right cully get over to the bunk get the table out of the way here there we are its all right cully sit down mind your head there we are there now then
8801,can you move your fingers ah youre lucky i think its only temporary paralysis
8802,thanks to you and jamie its nearly finished
8803,what weve still got a few feet left
8804,oh dear  jamie
8805,not just yet ive still got to defuse it before they explode it oh oh my word
8806,well its sealed its completely sealed i cant possibly undo it
8807,yes im afraid so unless i can think of some way of getting it off the planet without a
8808,well there is a way of getting it off the planet without it doing any harm to any of us at all
8809,ha but its not going to be easy
8810,now just leave it to me jamie you and zoe go back to the tardis teel take kando and cully and get them to the capsule and go to the capital tell them that therell be a minor volcanic eruption but with any luck nothing more violent
8811,there isnt time jamie come along
8812,dont ask me any questions theres no time
8813,its the rockets in the other perimeter holes come along wed better get inside the tardis theres going to be an all
8814,oh its quite all right jamie the planet is quite safe theres just going to be a localised volcanic eruption itll only affect the island
8815,oh my word  ltback to the episode listing
8816,oh my word come on jamie into the tardis quickly
8817,shush jamie a minute quiet oh oh dear
8818,well this sort of things happened before the fluid links dont seem to be able to take the load
8819,yes
8820,oh my word what a wonderful sight
8821,dont worry jamie were safe in the tardis
8822,well
8823,well no
8824,well perhaps the fluid links have cooled down by now thats a bit more power zoe can you read off what that meter is registering please
8825,yes
8826,ah
8827,oh no
8828,oh no
8829,if only i could unstick this stupid idiotic oh there we are oh
8830,no but ive
8831,ive stopped the fluid links from vapourising we shant suffocate
8832,well there is an emergency unit but oh no i cant possibly use that
8833,but it moves the tardis out of the time space dimension out of reality
8834,oh i oh all right
8835,is there any reading on the meter zoe
8836,no none of the meters are registering not one
8837,yes possibly id better get working on the tardis controls right away
8838,no why
8839,well because well were nowhere its as simple as that ill be in the power room jamie
8840,whats happened
8841,oh good good
8842,me worried no no its only the unknown that worries me zoe
8843,i dont know but you see the emergency unit is limited to a certain time simply because its
8844,youre interested in whats outside the tardis now arent you
8845,zoe listen to me if we move outside the tardis we step into a dimension about which we know nothing we should be at the mercy of the forces outside time and space as we know it
8846,zoe we must stay in the tardis
8847,but jamie its not poss you say you both saw different things
8848,so you both saw your homes
8849,zoe zoe
8850,no jamie dont you see those pictures that you and zoe saw on the scanner were put there obviously put there to tempt you to go outside
8851,i dont know but theres someone or something out there that wants us to go out of the tardis
8852,i dont know
8853,no jamie no
8854,jamie zoe  doctor
8855,shush jamie quiet
8856,nowhere
8857,all mental images jamie pure imagination
8858,i dont know weve got to be careful weve got to be very very careful now
8859,yes possibly
8860,i i i dont know
8861,no no were on our way all right but the trouble is i dont know where to
8862,thats all right zoe i dont think you could help it
8863,well i think whoever it was that was tempting you outside made it irresistible why even i gave in when the voice said
8864,i dont know perhaps there wasnt one perhaps it was just illusion
8865,oh yes yes yes the tardis is performing quite normally oh thats odd
8866,well this meters dropped below a thousand
8867,no it just means that were using more power than were storing but dont worry weve got n emergency power booster unit here somewhere if i can find the switch now no oh dear its here somewhere
8868,yes yes thats the one now just a little bit more power and read off the meter for me will you zoe
8869,yes
8870,good
8871,fine
8872,quiet jamie
8873,yes
8874,oh no oh
8875,good
8876,fine
8877,oh let it creep up now i dont want to blow the fluid links again
8878,hmm
8879,quiet jamie quiet
8880,i dont seem to be able to concentrate concentrate both of you concentrate on something
8881,read out the figures to me zoe aloud go on
8882,louder both of you read them off
8883,oh its getting stronger
8884,its dragging me
8885,concentrate both of you
8886,oh its too strong
8887,its too powerful
8888,oh its too powerful

8934,no when is a door not a door
8935,when its ajar

8938,yes well you go on ahead jamie
8939,well well yes
8940,well i think we may be in a place where nothing is impossible come on
8941,yes good idea come along
8942,theres a foothold
8943,no what
8944,this must be a world of words
8945,in for a pound theyre all sayings proverbs
8946,down you come theres a foothold can you manage thats right steady there
8947,its all right dont worry ive met this gentleman before hes a traveller like ourselves
8948,delighted to meet you again sir allow me to present my two companions this is zoe and this is jamie
8949,were trying to find our way out of this wood
8950,well havent you ever tried to escape from this place
8951,these tests whats the point of them
8952,oh the master again eh i suppose this army of robots works for the master as well
8953,oh surely youve seen them
8954,ah now but surely thats the sound they make theyre coming back
8955,we hide in among the trees quick theres a j theres room for two oh thank goodness theres a letter c you sir arent you going to take cover
8956,jamie zoe dont you see as far as hes concerned they dont exist he cant see them
8957,sir
8958,i think the soldiers want us to go in the other direction
8959,yes particularly dangerous toys too come along lets go
8960,well we shall soon find out
8961,shush listen
8962,its not a horse look
8963,keep quite still
8964,no
8965,stand still
8966,hold your ground
8967,no stand still
8968,no its not real its a legend you mustnt believe in it you mustnt say it doesnt exist say it
8969,another test
8970,he challenged us to believe it
8971,whoever it is whos setting up all these conjuring tricks
8972,well the unicorn appeared to be real until you said it wasnt then we were safe
8973,yes that was just the danger your belief was affecting me
8974,i dont know a fantastic mind
8975,weve got to get out of this place
8976,now its all right zoe oh come on come on if you want to play games lets get on with it
8977,well i have to make up his face again
8978,yes
8979,what no no no well i i was rushed now then there we are
8980,jamie
8981,yes look
8982,yes come along lets go inside
8983,just a moment
8984,ah yes a ball of twine hmm oh yes this must have been an invitation
8985,well its the classical way of getting through a maze now jamie tie that to the door will you
8986,yes i think we are
8987,yes
8988,dont break the thread come along
8989,which way do you think
8990,they both look equally unattractive to me
8991,shush how
8992,shush jamie
8993,no you stay here
8994,and zoe and i will explore a little further there must be another way out of this maze and i mean to find it
8995,just a minute i was rather expecting a welcoming committee but perhaps i was wrong
8996,ah yes but there has been someone here not so long ago either look
8997,oh oh
8998,what
8999,half man half bull yes
9000,exactly but i dont think we need be too alarmed after all
9001,but zoe its a legend another mythical beast like the unicorn
9002,no the minotaur is a mythical beast say it
9003,yes yes im afraid we made it too difficult for it to stay come on lets go and find jamie
9004,well he must be around here somewhere
9005,oh oh my dear sir
9006,you have a knack of turning up unexpectedly
9007,of course this er this person who controls this place the master
9008,have you seen him
9009,where might i find him
9010,yes now i think i understand may i ask sir where you come from would it not be nottingham
9011,useful for those who intend to travel  doctor  gulliver
9012,yes yes oh im looking forward to a long talk with you one of these days
9013,oh i wouldnt dream of detaining you
9014,farewell
9015,well he can only speak the words that dean swift gave him to say
9016,of course he is dont you understand this world that weve tumbled into is a world of fiction unicorns minotaur gullivers travels theyre all alive here
9017,im not sure i understand that yet come along lets find jamie youd better put this on
9018,i imagine there must be at least one more test i wonder what itll be
9019,a statue
9020,yes only the unicorn was alive first and then became a statue only this time
9021,have a care zoe i have a feeling the situation is going to be reversed
9022,medusa
9023,now we know what we have to do zoe
9024,zoe we have to say medusa doesnt exist
9025,zoe medusa is a myth if you believe it her she can turn us both to stone now zoe say it the medusa is a myth say it
9026,no
9027,no dont look in her eyes dont look
9028,no no thats marble think of her as a marble statue a legend
9029,maybe its another trap
9030,no how can i kill something that doesnt exist
9031,no wait perseus of course a mirror there look at her reflection in the mirror look can you see her
9032,this is how perseus escaped he looked at her reflection in his polished shield theres no danger in the reflection
9033,oh yes thats the citadel all right the question is how do we get up there
9034,zoe duck
9035,what
9036,what with that thing what sort of a gun is that
9037,rubbish such a weapon is scientifically impossible it doesnt exist
9038,but i dont ive never heard of him
9039,be careful
9040,dont do anything rash
9041,well well take us there theres a good chap
9042,the strip oh a strip cartoon of the year two thousand
9043,yes but i hardly had time to follow the strip cartoons
9044,well thank you thank you mister what did you say his name was
9045,ah yes mister karkus thank you
9046,come along
9047,why not its the usual way
9048,i am ze karkus  master
9049,shush year two thousand comic strip creation the hourly telepress  master
9050,what happened
9051,yes i thought theyd turn up sooner or later yes its a simple photoelectric cell we just id better lift you over it
9052,there we are
9053,oh im not leaving yet im here on business
9054,why do you say that
9055,yes well i see ill think it over very carefully
9056,no of course not i said id think it over well ive thought it over were staying on and fighting on
9057,oh yes
9058,lets have a look
9059,cancel doctor test report failure oh i think im beginning to understand
9060,well when someone writes about an incident after its happened that is history
9061,but when the writing comes first thats fiction if wed have fallen into the masters trap we would have become fiction
9062,zoe where are you going
9063,dont go
9064,no not through there
9065,gullivers not real we are
9066,no need to hide
9067,let them find us
9068,yes why not well ask for an interview with the master
9069,are you looking for us by any chance we demand an interview with the master    master
9070,responsible huh to someone else
9071,what is the purpose of all these tests
9072,no i cant say that i wait a minute a serial in a boys magazine
9073,the ensign
9074,you are a writer
9075,or is all this in charge of you
9076,i see that means that you are virtually a prisoner
9077,no i need to find out more
9078,jamie i think it will be safer if we all stick together
9079,you were about to answer my question are you a prisoner here
9080,i see yes and only an earthman type creature has the power to create fiction the power to imagine
9081,what is this intelligence you serve and why was i brought me here
9082,and you want me to
9083,i refuse
9084,i refuse i shall make that decision for myself
9085,what does that mean
9086,oh no jamie zoe
9087,what have you done to them
9088,you really would do that
9089,i see how very ingenious
9090,no my answer is still no
9091,i have yet to see a robot that can climb
9092,oh zoe jamie
9093,the master said you been turned into
9094,yes youve said that jamie
9095,is some thing wrong zoe
9096,but you keep saying the same things
9097,then its true theyre not real theyve been turned into fiction
9098,oh thank you my dear sir perhaps you could release this for me
9099,well no i dont actually want it you see i want to get down here somehow
9100,oh thank you
9101,oh thank you
9102,oh oh yes of course you are the princess rapunzel
9103,no no im afraid not but would you mind if i used your hair to get down there
9104,thank you very much now then where can we attach the
9105,the enemy had been finally defeated by the doctor no no i cant say that if i say that i nearly fell for it didnt i another two seconds and i should have turned myself into fiction
9106,jamie and zoe i left them here where are they jamie zoe
9107,please please i must think there must be some way out of this theres just got to be
9108,i only wish there was
9109,the tardis safe and sound by all thats wonderful
9110,the time
9111,but how did you find the tardis
9112,yes yes of course we must just as i was thinking that all was over
9113,whats happening
9114,to what purpose
9115,and its people
9116,sausages man will just become like a string of sausages all the same
9117,leaving the earth undamaged and uninhabited for you to take over
9118,if i cooperate
9119,so the computer feeds off my thoughts does it
9120,then it will create what i think
9121,are you so sure you couldnt control my mind before and you certainly cant control it now
9122,no youve given me equal power its now a battle of wits between me and you
9123,jamie zoe can you hear me think for yourselves dont be afraid you can open the book go on you can do it
9124,dont worry about fiction hang on to real life youve got to get out
9125,jamie zoe concentrate youve got to get out of there now push harder harder
9126,no jamie zoe run
9127,no suddenly the karkus came to their rescue     doctor
9128,but all the power had been used up on the soldiers and it was useless oh youll have to do better than that
9129,jamie zoe get away from there
9130,oh oh my goodness as the white robots advanced on the doc no i cant say that i cant say that
9131,zoe jamie oh my goodness

9133,dont argue jamie give me hand
9134,are you all right sir
9135,no you were kidnapped just like we were theyve been using your mind
9136,that depends how efficient the white robots are their last order was to destroy lets just hope theyre destroying one another
9137,you cant blow up a fictional character zoe
9138,well well just have to hope that the destruction of the computer returns us all to reality and you my dear sir
9139,well i hope so
9140,well we shall soon know hang on here it comes    ltback to the episode listing
9141,jamie youre right wed better just check though
9142,well lets see shall we

9145,zoe thats a missile
9146,now dont fuss me zoe
9147,well its the landing circuit it seems to have jammed thats why were stuck in space ah
9148,oh the stupid thing oh
9149,yes im sorry about that jamie are you all right zoe
9150,yes unless they knew already
9151,yes lets have a look
9152,it merely needs an overhaul jamie just like any piece of machinery
9153,no no we shall have to see if we can get some made lets have a further look shall we
9154,yes always supposing hes not a baby or a schoolboy now come along lets just collect this circuit and i think id better see this one there its all right its just a fault in the visual stabiliser circuit wed better take that too

9174,youre taking photos of yourself
9175,please let me answer one question at a time
9176,its all right its a very simple mechanism who is your uncle
9177,oh then professor travers doesnt live here
9178,what field of science is your uncle in
9179,well that is fortunate perhaps he might be able to help us is he at home
9180,well where is he
9181,oh yes thats all right
9182,miss
9183,miss
9184,have you any idea when your uncle is going to be back
9185,cant you get in touch with him
9186,they now who is they
9187,you mean your uncle has gone to work for these people well surely we can get in touch with him
9188,thank you
9189,three
9190,four
9191,two
9192,oh im sure of it
9193,ah jamie you mustnt let your imagination run away with you i must admit its a bit strange  woman
9194,theres only one thing for it well have to go there ourselves
9195,no it was stupid simpleminded computer answering service
9196,jamie and i are going to this place come on zoe
9197,oh well come on jamie oh the address
9198,oh thank you
9199,i thought so
9200,more stupid computers automatic receptionists right
9201,i would like please to speak with professor watkins
9202,then i would like to speak with someone in authority
9203,thats no good i wish to speak with somebody now
9204,but i insist this is an emergency
9205,its a private matter
9206,oh shut up you stupid machine diabolical inventions
9207,come on
9208,well there must be somebody else in this building except these stupid machines come on
9209,wait
9210,thank you
9211,jamie i think perhaps it is we who should be apologising to you mister
9212,yes it is
9213,oh i see
9214,no i dont think so thank you very much
9215,well
9216,yes i
9217,oh how very kind
9218,yes thats how you turn it off jamie
9219,yes of course come along jamie
9220,doctor goodbye
9221,jamie
9222,hmm
9223,yes that fellows not what he seems
9224,no no no i mean vaughn the normal range of human blinking is about once every ten or fifteen seconds vaughn was blinking far less frequently than that
9225,oh im not joking jamie underneath all that charm there was something odd sinister almost inhuman                isobel
9226,accept the situation jamie theres nothing else we can do
9227,its colonel lethbridgestewart
9228,ive told you over and over again jamie time is relative
9229,yes were still travelling yes
9230,any more unbelievable than the yetis
9231,but whats all this and why all the cloak and dagger stuff to bring us here
9232,how nice
9233,oh thank you and a patty cake biscuit thank you
9234,but whats so odd about people going into the building
9235,and all these people went into the building the ie building and didnt come out
9236,odd
9237,jamie yes
9238,i expect that hes all right he was all right this morning when we left him brigadier tell me more about this international electromatics setup
9239,oh jamie dont
9240,put it away
9241,but whats your interest in this
9242,i see i dont suppose you have any authority to search the building have you
9243,well it looks to me if jamie and i want to find the professor well have to find him in our own way
9244,is that a tank
9245,jolly good
9246,oh yes thats splendid yes this should come in very handy
9247,zoe isobel
9248,oh jamie how can i think when youve got that thing on
9249,all right all right
9250,all right i just want to take a look at it thats all oh yes its an interesting little piece of
9251,well well well what have we here
9252,theres a micromonolithic circuit in the back plate of this radio
9253,its a very complex circuit in miniature
9254,it has nothing to do with the radio as far as i can see
9255,all right
9256,i suggest that we try the wall
9257,isobel never writes anything on paper you cant lose a wall remember
9258,jamie wed better go after them
9259,theres no one in there except that stupid computer and thats wont tell us anything
9260,well if the brigadiers men are still around they should have seen them go in hello  man
9261,yes of course jamie come on
9262,thats incredible
9263,the ease with which that man carried that crate
9264,lets go and see
9265,its odd jamie its distinctly odd
9266,yes
9267,yes
9268,there must be a door to the main building somewhere
9269,no jamie wait
9270,the guards come on
9271,jamie jamie we came here looking for two friends of ours
9272,where are they now
9273,jamie jamie it would set our minds at rest if we could take a look inside those boxes
9274,how kind
9275,well thats very civil of you
9276,oh really
9277,thank you
9278,oh how kind
9279,really
9280,oh thats quite simple i hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them
9281,why do you say that
9282,oh how kind
9283,yes
9284,i havent forgotten them jamie
9285,jamie were not going to help zoe by annoying mister vaughn are we
9286,hes too nice
9287,i dont know he was a little bit too interested in these circuits for my liking
9288,well i dont see how he could do
9289,yes but thats what worrying me
9290,well if vaughn has anything to hide why is he letting us talk to watkins
9291,yes jamie i can see lets have a closer look at that shall we
9292,well it looks like a deep space radio communication system whats its doing here
9293,yes it could be
9294,yes yes they went to america didnt they
9295,oh yes
9296,well its a long story
9297,jamie jamie i dont think the professor wants to hear about that
9298,professor i think that i should warn you that anne travers allowed her imagination to run a little wild
9299,jamie i think that there are other more important things to talk about at the moment
9300,professor tell us about what youre doing here
9301,oh yes a teaching machine
9302,no no not entirely theres my friend the brigadier remember
9303,possibly but quickly tell me what is vaughn up to whats he doing here
9304,i wonder ive a nasty feeling hes aiming somewhat higher than that
9305,oh how kind
9306,all right
9307,oh dear you know jamie ive always been rather scared of lifts
9308,i never even like to start them youll have to push the button
9309,yes jamie do as youre told
9310,packer mister packer i obviously cant let you hurt zoe and so ill have to tell you all want to know now
9311,yes im sure that mister vaughn will oh there he is now
9312,your knife give me your knife
9313,im going to try and break the circuit
9314,it will either stop the lift or send us out of control
9315,well have to take that risk hold tight here we go
9316,there was a fiftyfifty chance you know jamie
9317,no no its the lift thats stuck not us look
9318,out into the lift shaft i imagine quickly on me back
9319,jamie
9320,thank you jamie oh my word well thats a long way up isnt it oh well wed better get cracking before they realise whats happened perhaps id better shut this
9321,oh thats simple
9322,we get squashed
9323,im very much afraid it is come on
9324,yes we will come on
9325,its stopped they must be checking come on they may guess where we are and come after us
9326,hurry jamie hurry
9327,no come on lets see where we are
9328,down there
9329,well we cant go down the lift again can we hello theres a fire escape come on
9330,it could be
9331,yes
9332,jamie hide quickly hide               doctor
9333,shush
9334,i think the guards are still out there
9335,keep your voice down
9336,alive jamie the darkness plays funny tricks with the imagination
9337,are you sure
9338,all right lets have a closer look  guard
9339,wait well follow in a few moments
9340,no no not yet weve got to rescue the girls first tenth floor central block come on
9341,i should think thats the central block wouldnt you jamie
9342,stop looking for problems jamie lets get along up there shall we    vaughn
9343,theres just about time enough to effect a simple rescue operation come along jamie
9344,yes come along
9345,good as long they dont give the game away too soon
9346,no no of course not help me to get this over the side there
9347,hmm jamie that object on the other side of the moon
9348,mmm yeah
9349,and then there was that deep space radio transmitter i wonder
9350,did anyone by any chance photograph any of these objects
9351,oh if you would be so kind
9352,unidentified flying objects
9353,possibly how long ago were these objects first sighted
9354,jamie when you were hiding in that crate you say something moved
9355,did you recognise it at all
9356,i dont know weve got to find out and quickly
9357,well obviously they bring these things whatever they are up from the factory in the country to the london premises thats where were going to find the answer
9358,jamie we have to find what is inside these crates brigadier have you got a map including the london premises
9359,oh yes i see
9360,oh my word how very fortunate
9361,brigadier you dont by any chance know where i can find a canoe    the doctor and jamie paddle a rigid canoe down the regents canal leading under a bridge
9362,yes yes now come on
9363,shush
9364,i dont know jamie but theyre here arent they come on lets go back to the canoe
9365,yes im afraid its true zoe
9366,theyre from another world inhuman killers
9367,oh theres hundreds of them possibly thousands
9368,that deep space radio transmitter is obviously being used by the cybermen spaceships to home in on
9369,i dont know jamie captain wheres the brigadier
9370,no no captain the people who went into vaughns headquarters were different when they came out werent they
9371,who is the brigadier is immediately answerable to
9372,oh dear
9373,you see a network of tunnels underneath london
9374,yes and look theres a main flood relief sewer running right underneath the warehouse
9375,oh no no besides many of these tunnels are dry and only flood during heavy rainfall
9376,it might be better at the moment to find out what form this attacks going to take jamie
9377,that transistor radio that vaughn gave you have you still got it
9378,brigadier have you any ie equipment here
9379,may i see them please
9380,thank you
9381,this is rather like looking for the proverbial needle in the proverbial just a minute
9382,i dont know wait a minute
9383,ive no idea but its certainly not part of that equipment have a look
9384,oh it does something all right the question is what
9385,no im afraid not what i really need is laboratory facilities im sure that this micromonolithic circuit is something to do with the cybermens invasion plan
9386,oh no thats no problem i can go up to london and use professor watkins laboratory at traverss house
9387,thank you
9388,brigadier
9389,wheres jamie and zoe and isobel
9390,london what on earth for
9391,whats the matter whats happened
9392,what
9393,id better go back to london with him and see if i can make some sort of sense of these circuits im going to have to leave my three friends in your very capable hands
9394,thank you
9395,no not yet theres an alien logic in these circuits but i havent been able to work it out yet
9396,no not yet
9397,how long will that take
9398,but that might be too late
9399,yes of course
9400,it could be it just could be
9401,oh thank you
9402,no no no no no
9403,brigadier if you could rescue him he might be able to help us with our problem
9404,zoe
9405,lets hope it isnt oh how do you do jamie now then here is the earth and here is the moon
9406,precisely
9407,the micromonolithic circuits are artificial nervous systems once activated they will produce the cyberhypnotic force that controls human beings
9408,yes there is a way to block the signals isnt there zoe
9409,yes have you any neuristors here professor
9410,zoe i want you to show the professor what to do the invasion could come at any moment
9411,brigadier they must all be fitted once the invasion could come at any moment  brigadier
9412,what there must be some more amongst all this gubbins come on lets have a look we must protect everyone here at least now search everybody come along
9413,zoe my depolariser it must have fallen off
9414,yes jamie i rather gathered that is everyone else all right
9415,oh what about the brigadier and the rest of the men
9416,brigadier what about the rest of the unit men  brigadier
9417,yes we appear to be sitting right in the middle of the hornets nest
9418,i agree the cybermen will attack in force now there must be thousands of them in outer space
9419,not unless we can stop the cybercontrol signals
9420,yes im afraid it does
9421,how long would all this take
9422,oh im surprised theyre not here already
9423,yes at least we know where theyll land theyll home in on vaughns radio signal
9424,yes thats a good idea we might have a try
9425,oh zoe sit down its a big bumpy now hows jamies leg
9426,well he would be wouldnt he hows the professor
9427,well i suggest that you go with the brigadier much as i detest computers i think that remarkable brain of yours will come in very handy
9428,i think its about time i had a serious talk with our mister vaughn
9429,no we need time if were going to stop this attack and i think i can get us that time
9430,you cant afford not to brigadier if youre going to attack the cybermen with missiles theyre going to retaliate and we want to know how and with what
9431,ill leave my radio on and then youll hear every word that passes between me and vaughn
9432,oh theres one particular place where therell be no cybermen
9433,in the sewers
9434,bye bye
9435,unit control this is the doctor is the brigadier there please  walters
9436,then you must know what ruthless and inhuman killers they are
9437,do you really think theyll honour any bargain that you make with them
9438,what do they get out of all this
9439,oh youre a fool vaughn when they get here theyll take over
9440,oh possibly but what about the others out there in space are they conditioned to obey your commands
9441,with the professors machine
9442,with one machine
9443,but youll have to have the professors help to do that wont you weve got the professor
9444,but you cant be sure of that can you
9445,but you darent take the risk once the cybermen take over theyll destroy the earth as we know it
9446,im trying to stop you from destroying the human race
9447,i dont know what youre talking about
9448,you must stop them this is madness you cant trust them
9449,is this what you wanted to be the ruler of a dead world      vaughn
9450,now youre beginning to understand the cybermen vaughn you cant make bargains with them
9451,vaughn switch it off youll blow us all sky high
9452,that wont stop them theyre still out there in space preparing to destroy the world
9453,vaughn listen to me the cybermen will deliver their bomb on the same radio beam they used for their invasion youve got to turn it off man youve got to turn it off
9454,were both on the same side now both fighting for our lives youve got to turn the radio beam off
9455,yes thats how theyll deliver their bomb
9456,vaughn where is the transmitter for the radio beam
9457,oh dont be a fool man where do we turn it off
9458,right we must stop them brigadier brigadier this is the doctor can you still hear me
9459,yes if youll help us
9460,well to save us to save yourself
9461,oh for heavens sake stop thinking about yourself think of the millions of people on earth who are about to die
9462,vaughn will you listen
9463,yes brigadier  brigadier
9464,oh dear
9465,vaughn says that the transmitter controls are in the old ie factory thats on the east side of the compound
9466,we want to get to the radio transmitter control room the cybermen dont know were here yet lets keep that element of surprise come on well try down here
9467,look out come on
9468,come on then         brigadier
9469,there dont seem to be any cybermen about at all thats odd
9470,look behind you
9471,what yes yes its there in that building the radio transmitter control youve got to destroy it
9472,oh but
9473,im not sure possibly to try to avoid the russian missile or
9474,yes im afraid so you see from where they were lets say two hundred and thirty thousand miles out in space their conventional missiles couldnt deliver the bomb so they had to come in close
9475,but its going in the opposite direction  turner
9476,yes brigadier im afraid it is
9477,yes this is fine thank you
9478,yes yes well im very much obliged to you captain
9479,goodbye to you goodbye isobel goodbye everyone come along jamie
9480,now then where exactly did we leave it you two try over there
9481,there we are all done and ready to go bye bye bye
9482,lovely lovely lovely
9483,well lets explore shall we
9484,yes twin suns its bound to be hot
9485,no no no no the instruments in the tardis would have told us no its a its a mixture of ozone and sulphur very bracing
9486,oh fascinating structures magnesium silicate
9487,dead is it
9488,yes fascinating architecture its more typical of a low gravity planet and yet i think this is quite normal yes
9489,yes possibly  jamie
9490,i hardly think so zoe
9491,oh this is interesting
9492,metal would you say so i think wed better get away from here
9493,come along
9494,well this isnt a building this is a machine come along
9495,come on quickly behind the rocks
9496,shush
9497,i dont know jamie come on lets get away from here
9498,now just leave this to me zoe
9499,but but one of your people has been
9500,theres no time for explanations as i say one of your people has been
9501,look we are friendly
9502,oh i dont think so zoe theyre too civilised for that
9503,well we can try just a minute wait
9504,now jamie dont be so rash
9505,jamie
9506,that was the very question i was going to ask you what is happening here where has that girl gone
9507,there is no time to explain
9508,that girl now where has she gone
9509,whats behind that wall
9510,how do you open this door
9511,because a moment ago we saw a young man dressed in a silver robe just like that girl we saw him killed
9512,well it may have been poisoned once but i can assure you its quite safe now
9513,oh jamie youre right we must save her
9514,well come on
9515,i wonder how long i imagine we havent much time
9516,you keep away zoe keep right away
9517,well mister
9518,yes well you can find some more stones like this
9519,well if you want to help now then
9520,yes zoe so can i
9521,the vandals look at that
9522,my favourite umbrella
9523,let me see oh dear this is almost catatonic
9524,im not a doctor of medicine you know zoe however if theres no damage to the tissue is there anywhere we can take her
9525,well lets take her there give me a hand come on jamie
9526,youre resting youre calmly resting your mind is quite empty youre resting now youre going to sleep vana sleep feeling sleepy very sleepy sleep
9527,shes asleep at last
9528,well i hope so jamie its difficult to tell
9529,oh really competition for you zoe
9530,how did all this begin selris
9531,and everyone uses these machines
9532,whose law selris
9533,but i thought you said all your laws were given you by the krotons
9534,i see a sort of selfperpetuating slavery and the krotons always choose your two most promising students
9535,hmm well its time it was stopped anyway its high time it was stopped
9536,another war between your people and the krotons you mean
9537,not if we cut through the wasteland
9538,oh that wore off a long time ago its quite safe now
9539,stop it stop it all of you listen to me this will do no good at all these krotons must have enormous scientific powers you cant defeat them with axes
9540,i think somethings coming out now
9541,i dont know zoe but keep well clear of it
9542,its all right zoe i think its quite safe now
9543,just watch this jamie
9544,yes and the pattern is my face
9545,yes so it seems its rather flattering isnt it
9546,yes that means they must have a scanner in the wall of the machine now if we can find that we might be able to get in touch with them
9547,yes that poor fellow must have confused its attack mechanism
9548,well it was programmed to kill once me it must think that its succeeded stupid machine
9549,i borrowed it from beta
9550,they dont that works on stored solar energy yes the gonds are quite advanced in some ways their medicines very good but they havent got much general chemistry i wish they had an etc machine though
9551,yes and the machines are programmed by the krotons so the gaps in their knowledge may be significant ah selris
9552,well i think shes better its difficult to tell selris is it safe to enter the learning hall yet
9553,zoe and i want to have a look round dont we zoe
9554,yes thats right jamie hold out your hand will you
9555,these pills i got from beta
9556,no no theyre for vana i want you to stay and look after her
9557,because i particularly want you to give her those pills the moment she wakes up
9558,to learn zoe why else
9559,oh my dear fellow theres no need for that
9560,oh well certainly come along zoe
9561,selris whats that
9562,oh whats down there
9563,i wonder how far underneath lets have a look shall we
9564,ah but there was selris something rather curious
9565,zoe
9566,what do you think youre doing
9567,you should know better than to do a thing like that
9568,very pleased
9569,zoe now just you listen to me whatever else they are these krotons are certainly not friendly now we know that dont we
9570,they use these machines to plant impressions on the mind thats how theyve enslaved these people all these years
9571,what
9572,oh what of it
9573,yes well zoe is something of a genius of course it can be very irritating at times
9574,yes its hard but its not brittle ive never seen anything quite like it
9575,mm oh what selris calls the foundations zoe it was like a root structure
9576,that this socalled machine is organic in structure yes
9577,well why not some crystals do resemble simple virus forms i wish i could get a bit of it for analysis
9578,well all life doesnt necessarily have feeling you know
9579,oh what does it say
9580,zogond zoe they mean you
9581,and we all know what happens to them dont we
9582,well she doesnt have to go does she well does she or doesnt she
9583,theyll destroy you i see
9584,now do you see what youve done fooling around with this stupid machine
9585,but that machine doesnt know that
9586,im going to take the test i cant let you go in there alone what do i do
9587,all right theres no need to shout now go away and dont fuss me no come back whats this its all right i know right fire away im ready
9588,oh dear ive been working in square roots can i have that again please
9589,oh now what have i done
9590,i am zoe i am
9591,its clever isnt it the way they make you feel that theyre pleased with you
9592,what of course they are what happens now
9593,well they can wait we are going in there together
9594,sounds a bit like a dinner gong doesnt it zoe
9595,doctorgond idiots
9596,yes well are you ready
9597,well we started this wed better go through with it weve got to get to the bottom of this somehow zoe
9598,oh cheer up cheer up i expect itll be quite interesting really
9599,eh oh oh thats very nice of them stay close to me zoe
9600,yes but there doesnt seem to be any crew hello anybody there is anybody at home hello
9601,yes i think we have zoe er zoe hold onto the end of this chain
9602,look up there its a force generator this chain may help to equalise the power load
9603,no its a forcefield try and relax relax
9604,are you all right zoe oh
9605,oh
9606,oh some tremendous power oh
9607,yes and they used it or rather us to operate a thermal switch
9608,yes
9609,yes there was zoe i think that im beginning to understand
9610,thats curious zoe i think weve gone and done it
9611,well now just a minute ive got an idea
9612,well life is supposed to have begun on your planet in the sea primeval soup someone once called it well there are lots of sorts of soups arent there i wonder what this sort is
9613,yes i think youre right zoe zoe look
9614,i think its time we got out of here come along
9615,yes we have once we can analyse this now come on
9616,yes there must be a tripmechanism
9617,well if its not working
9618,yes
9619,just a moment i have an idea
9620,that piece of mica i picked up here we are now if i can use it to bridge the gap
9621,well the whole machines made of crystal
9622,yes but jump down to the side dont go down the ramp
9623,well dont worry about him hes perfectly safe isnt he come on
9624,so these creatures have a life system based on tellurium eh its fascinating isnt it zoe then that tank must have been a polarised centrifuge
9625,oh dont blame yourself zoe that machine must have lain around for thousands of years waiting for someone as clever as us to turn up
9626,yes thats horrible still you must admit that its a very good way of existing through time
9627,oh theres some deposits of sulphur around here somewhere
9628,hydrogen telluride
9629,the worst smell in any world
9630,zoe id say it was a safe bet that that machine is composed of tellurium
9631,oh itll come in useful its very useful stuff sulphur you know very useful stuff indeed
9632,look at this its almost pure sulphur
9633,yes in a minute what do you know about tellurium zoe
9634,yes
9635,mmm hmm well go on
9636,oh my giddy aunt  kroton 2
9637,oh yes yes
9638,quick zoe up there run    kroton 2
9639,no apparently not in the light it was dark in the machine wasnt it
9640,yes
9641,yes its being directed by the machines scanners
9642,yes
9643,well theres nothing we can do till that wretched kroton moves away     kroton 2
9644,yes what a stupid place to land you can tell that the captain is not at the helm cant you
9645,well it only does that you see if i remember to set the hads
9646,the hads the hostile action displacement system if the tardis is attacked it automatically dematerialises now i think its safe for us to move now
9647,well er weve got to tell the gonds that were all right havent we and jamiell be worried come along now carefully
9648,yes im sorry weve been so long
9649,oh yes well we did but er well what goes in must come out mustnt it youre better arent you sit down
9650,you mustnt oh im glad to see youre going on holiday
9651,well it looks as though
9652,evacuated what do you mean
9653,but didnt he learn his lesson last night
9654,oh i dont think thats a very good idea zoe theres no time to be lost will you take us to beta please
9655,can you hold my bag please theres a small job i want you to do
9656,its sulphur ive written out some instructions here i dont know whether you can follow them can you
9657,yes beta did it ever occur to you to wonder why
9658,i havent seen him since this morning
9659,come on we must go
9660,give me a sample of that as soon as you can
9661,stop it stop it
9662,what do you think youre doing you idiots unhook the thing youre meddling with things you dont understand
9663,zoe run run
9664,yes yes i think so i dont think theres any bones broken but if they dont get that vibration under control soon
9665,oh look out
9666,yes well hurry up zoe weve got to move out of here you know
9667,oh that was not an earthquake
9668,yes that means the krotons are free to deal with us havent you finished yet zoe
9669,no here id much rather you use this
9670,hello
9671,im not so sure  look at that
9672,id say it was no longer functioning under full power vana how is beta getting on with the acid i asked him to make
9673,oh good
9674,yes basically with a few things added dont touch itll burn you
9675,jamie id forgotten all about him in the excitement
9676,followed us what in there
9677,yes and if the machine rejects him like the others come on
9678,jamie
9679,jamie watch out for the poison jets
9680,weve got to get you out of here
9681,jamie
9682,i think youre getting free
9683,oh
9684,theres no time to explain jamie how are you feeling
9685,good
9686,theres something i want you to do for me
9687,now beta is making some special sulphuric acid for us i want you to go and tell him to make it in bulk
9688,as much as he can
9689,theres no time to argue now hurry well see you back at the learning hall
9690,well if only we can get inside that machine again zoe
9691,oh
9692,oh thats very good of  what whats all this
9693,really we will not be bullied dont push  vana vana have you got that bottle its vital kroton
9694,yes vana oh        kroton 2
9695,look out
9696,assist you in what way  kroton 2
9697,no no zoe if this machine does run down there will be the most colossal release of energy enough to destroy us the krotons and most of the planet if you want us to help you you must explain what you want us to do what is this thing
9698,youve discovered a way of using mental power
9699,if you want us to cooperate you must expect questions
9700,very well but that wont help you will it
9701,oh i see and you set the machines systems to educate the gonds up to the standard you require
9702,now just a moment if were going to help you transfer the dynatrope back to your own planet whats going to happen to us
9703,well how can we be sure of that we die without oxygen you see just as you would die if anyone was to upset the stuff youre drawing from that tank
9704,i was merely trying to explain that if anyone was to contaminate what was in that tank youd know what it was like to breathe poisoned air
9705,oh well i suppose wed better just take your word for it then
9706,oh now then where do you want us to stand
9707,oh well ill stand over here then
9708,oh my dear oh well you stand there and ill stand here better still a much better idea ill stand here and you stand over there
9709,all right all right how do you wear these things
9710,give it time
9711,well its your fault youre making me nervous
9712,down zoe
9713,yes yes its returning to its basic form
9714,yes we must get out of here look zoe the machine is melting come on lets get out of here before were trapped
9715,yes
9716,yes well im a little bit shaken but not half so bad as the krotons i can assure you whatre you doing here
9717,well done
9718,hmm well the machine was eighty percent tellurium zoe and tellurium is soluble in sulphuric acid
9719,no well the acid wasnt pure sulphuric acid but it worked didnt it come along lets get away i dont like goodbyes
9720,that is what im trying to find out zoe
9721,we cant be
9722,ah there we are what in heavens name
9723,just a minute just a minute oh this control is there we are now that thats an ionjet rocket of the twenty first century but this helmet if i can there we are thats not nearly so sophisticated its certainly not later than 1960
9724,of course
9725,just a minute
9726,hmm well its a flying machine designed by a gentleman by the name of leonardo da vinci in about 1500
9727,were in a museum
9728,a space museum look there you are
9729,oh my word
9730,yes my word jamie look at that
9731,very large
9732,shush jamie im trying to listen man
9733,jamie i think thats just a tiny bit
9734,now just listen there really is no need for all these histrionics we are perfectly harmless
9735,oh well the usual way we just materialised
9736,well this is a museum
9737,well yes in a way
9738,zoe i think we do owe this gentleman an apology we really are most interested in the museum mister
9739,yes but theres no need to threaten us you know
9740,laugh you mean people laugh at all this why its a magnificent exhibition
9741,no of course not we havent come to take anything we genuinely are interested in space travel why especially a thing like this this is superb
9742,you mean this models been abandoned but its speed and stability concept alone its a tremendous advance in rocket design
9743,ill give you an hand here we are oh yes this is superb my word
9744,i see and these must be the secondary electrode accelerators
9745,that was awkward what did you do about that
9746,what have we go here ah blueprints
9747,but surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means of transport wouldnt they besides how would man get beyond the moon
9748,i see so you lost government backing
9749,well i can understand your bitterness very shortsighted of the government to put all their eggs in one basket
9750,well
9751,oh how do you do this is zoe and jamie and im the doctor
9752,professor listen to them
9753,in a way this is a triumph for your rocket
9754,yes or by a few million miles im afraid the tardis is not suited to shortrange travel
9755,yes i think i could get your rocket to the moon
9756,yes i have considerable experience in space travel and so have my two companions
9757,well perhaps youre overestimating the difficulties how much more work is required on your rocket
9758,well were willing to help as ive said
9759,yes
9760,jamie i hadnt thought about you
9761,but surely its only a question of getting to the moon we shall come back by tmat wont we
9762,im sure it will
9763,oh yes and even if i dont zoe has total recall
9764,theres no need we
9765,now dont worry about a thing your rocket is going to be in good hands
9766,thats quite enough jamie
9767,yes well weve taken
9768,now dont worry miss kelly were going to be perfectly all right
9769,yes you remember your take off briefing jamie
9770,theres one minute to go now hold tight everyone
9771,well one of the circuits has burnt out zoe ill switch to a secondary one
9772,oh dear this is most unfortunate
9773,well i had hoped we could stay in contact with earth
9774,it works off a different power source jamie solar power its independent of the tmat system
9775,well lets try shall we i think were near enough there thats our activating signal
9776,i know i know im trying to reactivate it
9777,well the solar power source must have been damaged jamie
9778,yes without the beam itll be impossible to land safely
9779,just a minute i think im getting something  phipps
9780,well i can assure you its not impossible what is your emergency whats happening on moonbase  phipps
9781,lets hope he can still transmit
9782,its not his equipment im worried about its his survival
9783,how much did you hear
9784,yes yes jamie and i have met them before they come from the planet mars
9785,mars is a dying planet i imagine theyre trying to find a new home
9786,oh i think that thats just a stepping stone
9787,yes well mars as you know is a cold planet theyve adapted to that its heat they cant stand
9788,hello moonbase hello moonbase can you read me  phipps
9789,did you hear that we want you to keep your transmitter going  phipps
9790,ah good oh yes oh i dont think i could have done better myself
9791,what well landing positions everyone
9792,dont worry jamie im sure were going to be all right     doctor
9793,no no i shall have to get us down as best i can
9794,well ill try yes yes there it is oh my word i think were going to be all right
9795,yes
9796,well the first we must do is to refuel you can see to that zoe cant you
9797,well i must go in search of mister phipps
9798,oh ive met them before
9799,well ive got to rescue mister phipps now havent i now where did i put that map of ah here we are now then the solar power room is here we are oh yes oh yes that seems to be quite a simple route
9800,no youll stay here and look after zoe now dont worry youre going to be quite all right
9801,good luck
9802,hello
9803,oh oh mister phipps i presume
9804,from the rocket we were talking on the radio
9805,no theyre still in the rocket how many of the ice warriors are there
9806,yes
9807,oh they have their weak points
9808,i see well theres only one thing for it we shall have to destroy tmat
9809,its an ice warrior its got miss kelly but how
9810,youve got no orders to kill me your leader will want to speak to me
9811,but i can be useful to you like fewsham your leader will be angry if you kill me im a genius
9812,i might ask you the same question
9813,our resources are not limited to tmat you know
9814,but you cant be sure of that can you the people of the earth may be preparing a whole fleet of rockets to defend themselves with
9815,and what are your plans invasion by tmat there are too few of you to conquer all the peoples of the earth
9816,why are you helping them
9817,do you know what is in that container
9818,then i shall have to have a look inside and you are going to help me
9819,you have got to help me
9820,very well i shall do it by myself if im caught which is most likely we will both get killed
9821,what are these things  they look like seed pods
9822,oh victoria jamie
9823,oh well done jamie
9824,yes i think so oh im a bit dizzy its so hot in here
9825,what well where are they now
9826,ah zoe
9827,yes i think so
9828,well do i gather we can get back to earth then
9829,but if were all going who is going to dispatch us
9830,oh i see how ingenious
9831,righto jamie zoe come along i think this could be quite fun you know
9832,you know i find tmat travel rather disappointing theres no sensation at all
9833,ah
9834,well
9835,please let us answer one question at a time
9836,jamie i am not surprised they have taken over the whole of the moonbase
9837,he should be back
9838,what but he said he was going to repair it
9839,then why did he let us escape
9840,but dont you see gentlemen the invasion of moonbase the taking over of tmat the seed pods the arrival of the ice warrior theyre all part of the same plan
9841,well im not sure yet have your people been able to make anything of it
9842,yes but have you tried to understand it
9843,im only suggesting that instead of trying to destroy it you find out its composition and purpose
9844,good then we must find a sample
9845,fine then theres no time to be lost
9846,dont worry ive already had experience ill be careful
9847,yes its organic its alive definitely a fungus composition
9848,a molecule of five atoms absorbs oxygen you know a complete blanket of this would reduce the oxygen content of the earths atmosphere quite drastically
9849,it would make the atmosphere of the earth uninhabitable to the human race but exactly like the atmosphere of mars
9850,just a minute there must be some way of
9851,sulphuric acid hydrochloric acid acetic acid
9852,oh i see zoe its the most wonderful news weve found a way of destroying the fungus
9853,water ordinary water
9854,theres no time to explain now apparently there is a weather control bureau somewhere i want you to get in touch with them
9855,well no no ive tried but theyre not answering or its broken down or something
9856,well get in touch with commander radnor and ask him to get hold of the weather control bureau people and to make rain as much rain as possible over the entire country
9857,right the professor and i are coming back now
9858,bye
9859,the sound can you turn it up  fewsham
9860,well quickly man its vital
9861,cancel the launch
9862,we can use that satellite to mislead the martian invasion fleet
9863,well dont you see poor fewsham deliberately let us overhear their homing signal we can imitate that signal with a homing device of our own in the satellite
9864,if we can deflect their armada half our battle is won
9865,well havent you already done that havent you been in touch with the weather control bureau
9866,but i sent you a message over an hour ago didnt zoe reach you
9867,oh i see well perhaps zoe went to the weather control people herself
9868,what
9869,zoe are you in there zoe            doctor
9870,oh no       doctor
9871,what what about jamie
9872,oh no we must help him
9873,what
9874,jamie
9875,i dont think hes stayed in there jamie come on
9876,no jamie i think this is just the place
9877,solar energy room that means thats a radiation door now if i can find the control
9878,it must be here somewhere
9879,ah wait a minute
9880,no jamie  it must be one of these
9881,ah there we are its got shut on it
9882,get back
9883,well it should hold for a little while jamie
9884,well commander radnors sending some security guards
9885,solar energy reflectors of course well we ought to be able to rig something up here
9886,is this the sort of thing that phipps rigged up zoe
9887,i think youll find that this will be better for
9888,yes yes open the door
9889,the only way to find out is to try jamie now open the door
9890,another moment and we could have destroyed him theres some more hd cable there
9891,you reel it out and ill make the connections
9892,yes yes thats it jamie hurry up
9893,now zoe
9894,im not so sure jamie after all its only the controls that are damaged the workings are all right if we can bypass the controls have you got your knife on you
9895,lend it me will you
9896,thats it thank you
9897,right now then zoe lets see what happens when we try to connect these two together  no i dont think so somehow what about these two  ah thats better i think ive succeeded in reestablishing one of these rain circuits jamie
9898,oh jamie weather control is a very difficult technology you cant expect immediate results
9899,well i hope so zoe just have to hope for the best thats all i must get on because theres another little job that i want to do
9900,well i want to make some alterations to my solar energy device     man
9901,well done
9902,yes miss kelly
9903,there isnt going to be a right one theres only going to be ours the wrong one and thats going to lead the entire martian fleet into an orbit around the sun
9904,oh obviously that has to be stopped
9905,well as soon as the satellite is up i shall tmat myself to the moon and destroy their homing device
9906,oh i dont think so ive rigged up a rather interesting little device here
9907,well its a development of the solar energy device that you so successfully used on the moon only ive succeeded in rendering it portable ive got a solar battery
9908,well that means that their invasion fleet is getting closer theres not time to be lost now are you quite clear as soon as i have succeeded in destroying their signal you must activate our signal in the satellite
9909,right then ill be off
9910,yes what is it zoe
9911,dont worry zoe i will are you ready miss kelly
9912,then nows the time to test it
9913,well you werent very successful were you
9914,well you dont expect me to tell you that do you
9915,yes im afraid you were a little too quick for me
9916,oh no i dont think i could
9917,oh thank you very much
9918,yes but they havent arrived yet have they something still might go wrong you know
9919,theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip
9920,yes that signal has been going no further than this control room
9921,not your signal ours
9922,we sent up a satellite that signal has sent your fleet into a false orbit
9923,you tried to destroy an entire world
9924,no im afraid that youve failed there too we can destroy the fungus
9925,jamie look out
9926,jamie a live terminal
9927,but zoe of course i did
9928,oh jamie sometimes i think youre never satisfied
9929,well you know questions explanations its very difficult come on
9930,i heard that jamie come on    ltback to the episode listing
9931,well i dont think were quite where i expected never mind this looks very interesting
9932,yes ive never seen a computer quite like this before jamie
9933,yes but what does it control
9934,jamie stop worrying theres obviously nobody here
9935,well this machine is programmed to operate by itself
9936,well im not sure zoe but i think were on an unmanned spacecraft in a fixed orbit were too far away from anywhere to be a weather satellite lets see what clues we can find through here shall we
9937,what
9938,theres only one thing we can do
9939,run
9940,that should hold them for a little while
9941,i dont know but were certainly not stopping to find out
9942,come on lets find somewhere else to hide
9943,what
9944,well i dont know if we go down there well bump straight into them im afraid were trapped
9945,just a minute i think theyve gone away
9946,they didnt seem very friendly did they oh
9947,well its hot you try
9948,theres something moving out there
9949,i dont know jamie perhaps theyre cleaning the windows
9950,a sensible idea zoe youre sure theres nobody out there
9951,mind out its hot
9952,what
9953,jamie i dont think its any use you know what i think theyve done
9954,theyve welded the lock were prisoners
9955,jamie jamie
9956,im coming down look out
9957,jamie im afraid that theres nothing on the other side just space it appears that this machine were on has been blown into about eight separate pieces
9958,well of course im sure get up and look for yourself if you dont believe me
9959,yes jamie
9960,sabotage perhaps
9961,i think they were here to defend the machine that would explain why they were so unfriendly towards us
9962,no zoe not aimlessly there appear to be rockets attached to each part of the machine and theyre all moving along together
9963,well as you know jamie when something explodes in space all the pieces separate and go on separating indefinitely but this machine has separated just so far perhaps a mile and now as i say theyre all moving together at the same speed
9964,it looks like it zoe
9965,a mile in space jamie with no oxygen or means of propulsion
9966,shush shush just a minute
9967,im afraid not zoe weve got to conserve it
9968,come here both of you look look at these
9969,theyre solar powered magnets its a force field
9970,well dont you see the explosive charges that blew this machine apart didnt damage its structure they simply divided it along the lines of its electromagnetic fields
9971,because there was no damage to the structure
9972,yes you see jamie opposite poles attract and the same poles repel
9973,yes
9974,but it just might jamie supposing i could step up the electromagnetic power enough to bridge the space between this section and the next
9975,yes and then repeat the process with each section and so on until we reach the tardis
9976,well ive got a screwdriver
9977,and ive got a slight knowledge of electromagnetism
9978,oh jamie would you move this cylinder out of the way
9979,well i dont zoe
9980,zoe dont be such a pessimist      warne
9981,i think thats all we can spare
9982,ive nearly done it jamie ive just got one more connection to make
9983,of course it will work the theory is perfectly sound
9984,yes yes its a little bit of a mess jamie but i can assure you its thoroughly functional thoroughly functional here we are now you two had better hold on are you ready
9985,hold tight here we go
9986,i know i know i cant turn it off
9987,ah no im stuck the powers too great
9988,im trying to zoe im trying to
9989,no zoe im afraid were not even if i could reverse the magnetic field im afraid were too far away from the next section
9990,yes oh dear what a silly idiot i am
9991,here you are
9992,i dont need so much as you
9993,just a minute jamie listen
9994,wait a minute jamie
9995,jamie no
9996,look i think hes just stunned zoe now look here my man i will not be threatened in this bullying manner do you understand
9997,pirates pirates oh i see
9998,oh jamie
9999,sheer politeness
10000,come on
10001,i told you she was polite
10002,oh we just arrived
10003,not so much on it as
10004,jamie youre better
10005,oh what on earths that
10006,hey wait for me
10007,dont you think it would be wiser to parley with him
10008,well from what mister clancey was saying i imagine its a metal thats used in the construction of spacecraft am i right
10009,magnetically polarised for copper
10010,i told you already we dont come from this civilisation we are visitors
10011,well yes yes youve grasped the principle very well
10012,its just a minor fault in the system i shall
10013,oh yes by the way mister clancey would it be going out of your way to drop us off at the space station please
10014,oh dear oh my word do you know where they are
10015,oh dear well that will be difficult wont it
10016,that would be lovely
10017,tillium
10018,yes jamie
10019,now now now jamie will power will power
10020,milo
10021,ive been watching this pressure gauge it is just a little bit high isnt it
10022,well except slow down i mean there could be a nasty explosion couldnt there
10023,oh oh yes is it inhabited
10024,yes but if shes a sworn enemy wont she give you away
10025,oh youve been there before have you
10026,jamie here mining i see for argonite presumably
10027,you want us to stay here
10028,just a minute where are you going
10029,i dont know jamie what do you think
10030,true but i think weve got to trust him jamie if we leave this ship well never ever have a chance of finding the tardis again
10031,a blast furnace i imagine i think i think the pirates are probably going to take the pieces and melt them down for the for the argonite the trouble is we cant guess where their headquarters is
10032,what
10033,applied oh i see youve been messing about again have you
10034,no no no no no come along surprise us
10035,oh yes
10036,yes circle fourteen yes go on
10037,yes except that after my little experiment we veered rather violently off that course
10038,oh
10039,do they really how interesting well whats the answer
10040,what
10041,oh bless my soul yes of course yes as you say a simple calculation i should have thought of that myself
10042,jamie its all here written down its as plain as a pikestaff
10043,yes jamie youre right
10044,yes i think its possible
10045,all right all right but if the tardis has landed here well have to find it anyway come on you two but for heavens sake dont make a noise on the ladder
10046,i think we should have done as milo told us he said wed get lost
10047,shush just a minute jamie
10048,i can hear something
10049,seems to be up ahead there
10050,where
10051,yes its reflected through from the other side i wonder if we can
10052,all right you jump onto jamies back
10053,there we are can you see anything
10054,well
10055,it looks as though weve stumbled on their headquarters yes of course that noise is an electrical furnace
10056,yes now the first thing wed better do is
10057,all right theres no need for that
10058,run
10059,no
10060,just a minute
10061,i like drawing pins ouch normally
10062,yes
10063,oh dear
10064,look
10065,i think its his shoulder i think its only a bruise its not broken lift him up very gently whats this
10066,well well its a long story but the important thing is to escape from here now
10067,oh no theres another entrance here somewhere
10068,theres a hidden door the problem of course is going to be finding it
10069,no no no no theres obviously a less painful way of getting in here so there must be a way of getting out
10070,look water in a fragile bowl well that couldnt have been thrown down that chute now could it    dervish
10071,patience jamie patience
10072,its got to be here look
10073,yes but see the way they run
10074,yes well were going to go on trying
10075,theres got to be a control unit here somewhere just a question of locating it thats all
10076,shush shush just a minute
10077,an audio lock
10078,well they were used on safes jamie combination locks became a little too easy to open when burglars took to taking miniature computers with them on their expeditions now i have my tuning forks here somewhere
10079,i usually carry them with ah yes here we are now then get these sorted out right
10080,you want to get out of here dont you
10081,yes jamie it is an audio lock is a simple solenoid switch which is only activated by a particular sound its just a question of finding it thats all
10082,jamie jamie
10083,oh no we cant
10084,well theyre here you know weve seen them
10085,well it might help if you didnt point that thing in our direction

10101,yes i think its working right now you two you carry along ill stay here and help jamie
10102,jamie wait
10103,right look stand clear
10104,he means that the argonite pirates are using the old mine workings as a secret hideout
10105,yes theres just got to be
10106,jamie
10107,all right theres no need to shout
10108,has anyone got a light its very dark in there

10110,you dont happen to remember where the light switch is do you milo
10111,ah well done zoe yes a whole box of them
10112,you take them and ill show you
10113,all right jamie ive got some matches now you just light the wick you see zoe and the wax allows the wick to burn fairly slowly there we are my word good lord this is very interesting
10114,i think somebodys been in here quite recently
10115,this clock
10116,its an eight day movement jamie
10117,yes thats what im wondering
10118,what is it
10119,jamie jamie let him go
10120,well hes obviously so frightened we cant make him worse look out
10121,well you cant expect him to behave normally we dont know how long hes been down here
10122,milo go and talk to him quietly
10123,talk to him about the things that he might remember
10124,you mean caven
10125,i think we shall get out of here how long have you been down here
10126,well from what weve seen of caven i think he always has a good reason for doing things jamie
10127,yes i think so zoe well dom we shall just have to escape wont we
10128,are you quite sure
10129,yes but its also the only way in
10130,i wasnt thinking of brute strength well well not much brute strength
10131,no jamie it isnt
10132,jamie i think you dont appreciate all i do for you milo
10133,supposing we could get out of this room do you think you could find your way back to your spaceship
10134,shush
10135,splendid right zoe hand out those candles two at a time will do
10136,just a minute jamie ill tell you now where did i put my bag of marbles
10137,right there we are i think that should be enough wax
10138,well it usually does jamie jamie pass me that marble will you
10139,the green one thank you very much its one of my favourites now what have you got dom
10140,that should make plenty of smoke right then is everybody ready
10141,ready
10142,whats happened to jamie and zoe i think i ought to go back for them
10143,what are you doing
10144,but
10145,i cant understand whats happened to them im going back
10146,oh no
10147,oh dear
10148,its all right jamie im perfectly all right
10149,i dont think he intended to zoe
10150,milo wasnt anywhere near the controls when it all happened
10151,yes i think its the only answer
10152,im not sure jamie but weve got to find that remote control unit and save milo and dom come on oh
10153,its all right zoe ill be all right if you dont fuss me come along
10154,oh my word im afraid the blast from the gun has fused the wires together
10155,i think i think thats the airconditioning circuit reconnected now then the radio link       doctor
10156,well i think so
10157,no this is much more difficult im afraid
10158,well
10159,what is it jamie im busy
10160,what
10161,i think the remote control unit will be probably situated somewhere in the computer preselector now do you know where that is
10162,then we must see to it that he doesnt
10163,besides we shall have to warn them of cavens intended escape
10164,theres only one man who can jamie milo
10165,i know i know but we shall free it
10166,get on to the space patrol tell them whats happened id better see how milos getting on with that birds nest
10167,right open the doors
10168,oh the tardis well thats no problem its orbiting lobos milos home planet in one of the beacon sections
10169,milos very kindly offered us a lift in the liz
10170,you never know you might have to  ltback to the episode listing
10171,well it looks like it zoe come on
10172,barbed wire jamie its filthy stuff i thought so
10173,were back in history jamie one of the most terrible times on the planet earth
10174,well yes i think so
10175,what
10176,oh oh my oh
10177,well where are we
10178,now just be quiet jamie and let me do the talking
10179,yes im afraid that weve landed up in the middle of one of the worst wars in human history
10180,well its trench warfare you see jamie these trenches stretch right the way across the continent of europe
10181,well i well i believe that they call it the war to end wars
10182,well theyve got no reason to keep us here things have calmed down a bit lets try and get away
10183,our transportation is over there you see were trying to get to it
10184,oh we dont want to bother him im sure hes very busy
10185,trying not to get killed
10186,er look major we dont want to trouble you if youd just let us go on our way
10187,but look major barrington if only youd let us get back to our transportation wed be no further nuisance to you
10188,now please dont let us lose our tempers
10189,jamie i think perhaps wed better do as they say
10190,oh thank you very much
10191,oh good im sure well be able to explain everything to his satisfaction
10192,but i thought you said we were going to see the general
10193,its just a temporary misunderstanding jamie well get it cleared up when we see the general
10194,ah they were all obeying orders zoe thats the military mind
10195,oh yes i expect hes a very nice chap
10196,major barrington how nice to see you
10197,court martial but were civilians
10198,oh yes that may be but if youll allow me to explain we were
10199,oh thank you
10200,waylaid the ambulance found us
10201,this is a travesty of justice what are we charged with
10202,but this is monstrous
10203,yes i most certainly have am i allowed to question the witnesses
10204,thank you lady jennifer will you please explain to these gentlemen the circumstances of our meeting
10205,what well lieutenant carstairs when your men recaptured the ambulance wasnt it obvious to you we were prisoners of the germans
10206,well if youre not going to allow them to answer what is the use
10207,well he didnt give me a chance did he theres something very strangely wrong here
10208,yes but why
10209,but this is ridiculous you know all the evidence has been twisted against us tell them
10210,i most certainly have something further to say this is all just a mockery i demand the right to appeal to a higher authority
10211,now you stay here zoe goodbye my dear
10212,oh thank you sergeant major have you been at the front long
10213,whats the matter
10214,zoe

10218,well done zoe can you undo it
10219,oh yes yes yes thats it thats the military prison all right thats where jamiell be take a look the trouble is those sentries

10221,you were sent to meet us
10222,now dont argue take us to the prison in you get miss heriot well drive on
10223,how dare you treat me like this sir
10224,dont you address me like that sir this is disgraceful i shall make a complaint directly to the minister himself
10225,im the examiner from the war office im here to inspect the military prison this young lady is my secretary well you were expecting us surely
10226,how dare you you send no car to meet us on our arrival and now you add insult to injury by doubting my credentials do you know who i am sir
10227,we are here to inspect the security arrangements of the prison now i suggest we stop wasting time and get on with it
10228,ah
10229,id like to see your records
10230,i sincerely hope not
10231,oh yes
10232,yes
10233,yes arrivals latest arrival scottish deserter awaiting return to his regiment possible to talk to a prisoner
10234,is something the matter commandant
10235,did i hear you say that someone had escaped
10236,matter why of course it matters shooting down prisoners why its barbaric
10237,well thats no excuse for murder i want the other man brought here
10238,im not satisfied i want to hear the prisoners side of the story
10239,well see you get a doctor if you need one my man right let him go commandant dismiss your man
10240,speak when youre spoken to now then whats all this about trying to escape
10241,im not concerned with that what about the other man you escaped with
10242,i see this is very serious i shall have to make a full report
10243,well see what general smythe has to say about that
10244,what are you doing
10245,ah youll regret this the minister
10246,my identity papers
10247,oh well done zoe yes i think hell survive right come on lets see if we can bluff our way out of here
10248,but thats a complete anachronism
10249,its something out of its own time
10250,both these things are in the wrong time but what are they doing here in 1917
10251,if youll take us to the generals room well prove this thing exists
10252,theres no time to explain now now where is this thing zoe
10253,what you mean you cant see that screen
10254,look at the wall concentrate
10255,can you see it yet
10256,no but somebody may have seen us weve got to get away from here all of us
10257,well anywhere so long as its away from here
10258,yes you can and youve got to come too your lives will be in danger now both of you
10259,now look my friends and i are leaving here are you going to shoot us down
10260,so what do you want us to do
10261,no no no no we must stay here and see what is happening
10262,right zoe up you go
10263,well perhaps its not perhaps its not german artillery
10264,no but general smythe might
10265,righto stay here keep under cover
10266,what is it
10267,gas
10268,its not gas go on
10269,well move over let me come on
10270,i dont know zoe some sort of force field
10271,yes its odd jamie
10272,start the engine
10273,ah lieutenant carstairs is this the only map youre supplied with
10274,its a bit inadequate isnt it
10275,oh they were romans
10276,oh lots of impossible things happen when you pass through time
10277,look it is 1917 where we are now on this map where we were attacked by the romans it is two thousand years ago
10278,surely before we met the romans we passed through a mist didnt we a gas you called it now supposing this mist is a barrier between different time zones
10279,yes what we need is a map which covers all the time zones im afraid we shall have to get back to general smythes headquarters to the chateau
10280,well thats easy you will take us
10281,what oh yes im afraid that theres nothing here only local maps here we are perhaps theres something in the generals room ill go and see
10282,well only this safe
10283,oh what a good idea
10284,well this is a military establishment there must be some explosives around here
10285,good
10286,yes i know jamie oh dear this is useless
10287,oh well yes that might blow the room up very nicely but i dont think it would affect the safe much you see we have to concentrate the
10288,whole explosion into the lock there
10289,now then if i can pack the explosive into the lock and then detonate it ah here we are now then ah yes i see
10290,its all right i do have the detonator you know now then just release this there we are now what have we got oh yes
10291,oh thats not very good is it
10292,now we light the blue touch paper and retire immediately
10293,we shall have to put the fuse out its too late duck
10294,ah yes here we are jamie
10295,look zoe 1917 zone roman zone american civil war zone this whole place is divided into time zones
10296,yes yes and i think that thats where weve got to get to
10297,ah you want me to come with you ah well if you put it like that yes here we go
10298,why dont you just call me doctor
10299,oh very well doctor john smith
10300,well we were lost you see
10301,i realise this must seem rather strange
10302,but i can assure you were quite harmless
10303,no no no we are not spies
10304,well you see thats rather difficult to explain
10305,all right if you insist
10306,well you told me to tell you the truth
10307,why dont you ask my companions if you dont believe me
10308,tell him the truth both of you
10309,oh dear look look i can prove to you that we come from another time this is a sonic screwdriver now where can i demonstrate ah that revolver will do its all right
10310,do you believe me now
10311,well
10312,well it is a little difficult to understand but
10313,but this is ridiculous
10314,no no no we are not spies the sonic screwdriver weve just shown you with the gun
10315,yes jamie now its very simple put the gun on the table you can keep your hand on it again if you like now watch
10316,thats right
10317,oh weve got lots of tricks like that let me show you catch jamie
10318,yes here we are
10319,i think were right about there
10320,zoe were right that was an american civil war soldier
10321,yes but it means were on the right road and were still making for that blank space in the middle of the map
10322,come on
10323,whats wrong
10324,oh no
10325,theres only one thing for it we shall have to go on by foot come along
10326,oh yes jamie this looks all right
10327,it was the way he wanted it
10328,we carry on of course weve got no alternative
10329,yes that is where well find the answer now wed better get some rest well have to start early in the morning
10330,i must have a look inside
10331,yes zoe youre right
10332,well there is an answer to that but i hope i just hope
10333,zoe come and see
10334,they seem to be in some sort of hypnotic trance
10335,theyre going to fight zoe thats what soldiers are for
10336,quick in here
10337,no wed only land up right in the middle of another war
10338,well this thing must eventually go back to its base thats where weve got to get to
10339,its taking off again that settles it
10340,yes all the soldiers have been delivered so this must be its base
10341,yes well there are some controls here i daresay i could get the hang of them
10342,yes youre right wed better put them on
10343,yes a sort of training school but for what
10344,yes i think so come on lets see what else we can find
10345,well we were just
10346,oh well if you insist
10347,lecture
10348,quite right zoe quite right
10349,no no no not yet later
10350,well i dont think much of that as a demonstration
10351,the man was obviously unhinged as a result of your experiment
10352,then why did he call me a german spy its obviously ridiculous isnt it
10353,huh then hes obviously no use for our purposes is he
10354,yes this circuit is overloading the neural paths
10355,you didnt deprocess that man first did you
10356,i saw a man whose processing had partly lapsed you should have completely deprocessed him first but i dont suppose you can do that on a machine like this
10357,what there
10358,yes
10359,oh
10360,oh yes i see yes thats fascinating
10361,thank you come along zoe
10362,run zoe run
10363,yes i was so interested in your demonstration i felt i had to come along and see how you were getting along
10364,really why
10365,oh no no no not me the girl
10366,well i was trying to catch her of course has she been caught
10367,oh good how are you getting on with him
10368,oh yes this is interesting i think youll find that bit goes just there will there be enough of these advanced models ready for our major plan
10369,oh but surely you must know in your position
10370,i would consider it a great honour if i could simply stand and watch
10371,thank you what are we doing now
10372,oh i see yes this is intriguing will he remember everything when he wakes up
10373,oh oh yes yes certainly
10374,no no please dont hurt him get him off
10375,what well what do you remember
10376,yes thats right unfortunately and brought here to the aliens war centre and brainwashed again but youre all right now
10377,ill explain as we go along we must find zoe oh
10378,that must be the security room
10379,thats was just the question i was going to ask you what did happen
10380,lets have a look oh yes its a very interesting little gadget
10381,really oh well lets try it shall we
10382,oh yes the resistance of course yes thats the american civil war the 191418 war yes its all recorded here scattered groups of resistance
10383,good then we can return to the time zones and organise the resistance into one big army that way theyll have a better chance
10384,well thats simple the way we came come on
10385,i dont know but theyre going to the landing bay come on
10386,until one of those things arrives if i can get inside im sure i can control it
10387,the lights flashing that means an arrival
10388,no theres nothing we can do
10389,i dont know
10390,no no this way to the processing room
10391,dont ask questions just follow me
10392,weve got to get in there
10393,now that room the other side that mustve been next door yes come on
10394,some sort of preformed plastic wouldnt you say zoe
10395,little bits of metal imbedded in it yes i think these panels must be held together by some kind of magnetic forcefield now if i could reverse that field cut me off some pieces of tape will you please zoe
10396,thats right one there thats right and one just there         scientist
10397,what a good idea yes
10398,yes
10399,yes well
10400,well well just have to take that risk wont we now then stand well clear
10401,watch
10402,i hoped he might be
10403,well the guns they use can be adjusted i think he was just stunned
10404,i think theyve possibly discovered that he was never processed
10405,no no wait
10406,i dont know but dont worry at least we know that hes alive now then weve got to get in there lieutenant
10407,i think youll find that bit goes there
10408,its all right youre quite safe
10409,were your friends
10410,well im afraid that theyve taken him away now up you get
10411,quickly through the gap in the wall here zoe help him
10412,ill be a minute
10413,just a minute
10414,well its the headquarters of the people who are running this whole disgraceful business
10415,yes its not quite as simple as that there are rather a lot of them
10416,they have rather sophisticated weapons you wouldnt stand a chance
10417,were going to return to the time zones and organise the resistance into one big army
10418,ah yes we do now my friend zoe has memorised an entire list of the resistance and their whereabouts
10419,now i must get you all back to the landing bay
10420,yes what we need is some kind of disguise
10421,its all right jamie its me
10422,all right put on this great coat
10423,shes waiting outside now come along
10424,are you ready right quick march
10425,yes i think so zoe now let me see
10426,oh my goodness
10427,its not very difficult zoe now the doors
10428,no no i shall follow in a few moments
10429,no but i must get the processing machine
10430,oh very well go on zoe off you go well follow in a few minutes good luck
10431,were going to let them in
10432,yes jamie thats splendid put it in
10433,theyre gas filled valves come on
10434,yes i hope so jamie there we go
10435,no not now ive set the emergency lock
10436,yes its only a question of overriding the master control now its a slightly different design to the tardis  security chief
10437,dont worry these things are impregnable against outside attack
10438,very nicely jamie now dont worry nothing can happen to us in here
10439,oh what have they done
10440,weve got no choice we have to do what they say  war chief
10441,what are you going to do with us
10442,i wont have my friends illtreated you know
10443,i am here under a flag of truce i demand to know what you are going to do with us
10444,oh i think that thats a perfectly horrid idea    security chief
10445,anywhere but the 1917 zone jamie
10446,yes eventually but not just now thats where theyll be looking for us
10447,well well go into one of the nearby zones and cross the time zone barrier on foot oh ah yes here we are
10448,yes jamie i probably confused the controls readjusting them in space in
10449,well no not really no
10450,come on here we go help me on with the processing machine now remember as soon as we land we must make ourselves scarce
10451,well theyre bound to be on the alert for us     security chief
10452,well i dont know its rather difficult to tell isnt it
10453,huh
10454,yes yes they cant follow us into a time zone barrier oh lieutenant carstairs do you feel all right
10455,oh good that means the processing machine is working all right
10456,just follow me jamie
10457,good im very glad to hear it i suppose youre going to subject us to another one of your farcical courts martial
10458,and what about my friends
10459,after some more of your mental processing i suppose
10460,do you have the authority to have me killed
10461,your alien superiors will want to question me
10462,so youre simply being malicious
10463,fortunately zoe arrived in time wheres general smythe
10464,what but hell be calling for help youve got to stop him
10465,why would he want to do that     security chief
10466,im not sure zoe i think theyve got something to do with the time zone barriers
10467,huh
10468,oh no ohm my word how many resistance did you bring
10469,mister russell how long can you hold on here
10470,well you must hold on as long as you can i think ive got the answer you see we have to have a safe base from which to fight these people i must go and get on with my work
10471,give some help zoe i want to dismantle this
10472,to find out how it works of course dont ask questions just do what i say
10473,you go and ask you go and help mister russell
10474,now then
10475,no i dont think that will be necessary
10476,shall we try it zoe right here we go
10477,shush listen
10478,no mister russell look out of the window
10479,yes ive set up a time zone barrier all round the chateau
10480,exactly but your people can come and go just as you please at last weve got a safe base from which to fight them we can carry out the next step in complete safety
10481,is this one of yours mister russell
10482,hes just the man we need     é
10483,i think that will do jamie
10484,i think its worked
10485,oh dear i wonder whether hes completely back to normal
10486,look try try to explain to him whats been happening
10487,yes yes yes everyone we capture we can convert to our side youll soon have all the men you need
10488,look mister russell i am doing my best if you can capture some more equipment i might be able to rig up something that will do dozens at a time
10489,oh dont worry im not going to hurt you
10490,i have nothing to say to you
10491,oh do you
10492,i had every right to leave
10493,we most certainly are not
10494,i had reasons of my own
10495,your reasons are only too obvious power
10496,i know that youve been kidnapping soldiers from the earth from various times in its history and bringing them here to kill one another
10497,no objective can justify such slaughter
10498,yes but why choose the people of the earth
10499,well that simply isnt true
10500,but why make them kill each other
10501,you have given these aliens our science and our knowledge to carry out this disgusting plan
10502,an empire of slaves with you as one of its rulers
10503,no
10504,i never promised to help you
10505,but to help people like that to conquer the galaxy
10506,ah carstairs
10507,zoe
10508,jamie
10509,yes yes everything is under control now listen everyone just follow me were going to take over the war room
10510,well i hope so but you know i find it hard to understand why you need me
10511,its something to do with the tardis travel machines isnt it
10512,i must congratulate you on them you know youre achieved a remarkable degree of control
10513,oh my dear fellow youre too modest dimensional flexibility remote control in my day these things were impossible to achieve without shortening the life of the time control units
10514,yes there must have been that particular problem is impossible to solve how did you solve it
10515,you havent solved it have you your machines have a limited life span sooner or later theyre going to be useless
10516,now i understand its my tardis that youre after isnt it
10517,yes but without me and my tardis your ambitions are going to be rather hard to realise arent they
10518,well i like to be on the winning side
10519,well i hadnt realised how small and weak their groups were compared with your might and power
10520,well your processing machines i can make them work more effectively
10521,ah yes but that will take time i can make the old ones work just as well probably better
10522,they are no longer my friends they are our enemies
10523,what but you
10524,no no dont come any closer no
10525,oh no leave me alone
10526,they were going to drop a neutron bomb youd all be dead now and all of your resistance friends with you if it wasnt for me
10527,yes i am trying to save your lives if you do exactly as i tell youll be all right
10528,yes and it was very nearly fatal     war chief
10529,oh yes quite sure i think that will do there we are now then when this young man comes to he will believe himself to be fighting the english redcoats in 1745 now get up
10530,what is your name
10531,your name
10532,do you know where you are
10533,well that is a friendly chieftain you will obey his orders as you will mine
10534,there you are you see complete loyalty and devotion i can do the same with all the other resistance people that you capture
10535,thank you bring the girl
10536,you will obey us it is for your own good
10537,there we are now then sit up sit up now then you are in la castille de la cruz de san antonio de la frada forma in mexico
10538,stop get him off me
10539,yes i fix her and you nearly fixed me
10540,they were going to drop the neutron bomb you were better alive here than dead out there
10541,yes very successfully from what i hear
10542,dont harm him we may need him
10543,did you really think id take part in your disgusting stealing scheme
10544,im sure that the war chief is going to cooperate hes going to help us gain control of the war room
10545,i see very well but first youll take us to the war room youre the only one that can stop the fighting in the zones
10546,no i mean yes come along jamie zoe     security chief
10547,will somebody turn off that hideous noise i cannot think
10548,yes ive been thinking about that
10549,yes call off the fighting at once
10550,you could we cant the fighting has to be stopped and everyone sent back to their own times
10551,by your tardis travel machines of course
10552,what but oh my word well thats happened rather sooner than i expected
10553,oh well yes
10554,i can still do that
10555,you stop the fighting
10556,the only people who can put an end to this whole ghastly business and send everyone back to their own times the time lords
10557,theyre my own people jamie
10558,no its not zoe but im afraid that theres no alternative
10559,yes zoe im all right
10560,its a box jamie
10561,its a very special sort of box it now contains all the information about whats been going on here and an appeal for help
10562,yes zoe
10563,ive never really needed it before jamie but this business of sending everyone back to their own times is well its too difficult for me
10564,hes gone
10565,he must be trying to get away before the time lords get here
10566,we must go to the landing bay and stop him
10567,yes but they wont be expecting us come on
10568,no no that wont be necessary well leave him for the time lords to dispose of
10569,im going to send for them now and i want you all to stay here and wait until they come
10570,well i cannot stay here jamie zoe this is where we say goodbye
10571,well the time lords will return you home
10572,because when i send this box to them theyll know where i am
10573,yes jamie they are my people but oh itd take too long to explain i have to go
10574,but you dont understand oh very well but dont say i didnt warn you right then we must return to the 1917 zone and find the tardis and make good our escape
10575,oh yes very well
10576,the time lords will return you home now come along
10577,but you dont understand mister russell i must go please
10578,look i am not going to argue jamie zoe carstairs into the machine
10579,for once jamie do as you are told
10580,then you will just have to kill me mister villar
10581,yes well goodbye lieutenant
10582,theres the tardis weve got to get on
10583,come on
10584,time lords try harder we must get away
10585,yes i hope so jamie if i can boost the power enough the tardis may be able to break through the force field
10586,it was the time lords
10587,yes thats right
10588,what well i was bored
10589,well the time lords are an immensely civilised race we can control our own environment we can live forever barring accidents and we have the secret of space time travel
10590,well we hardly ever use our great powers we consent simply to observe and to gather knowledge
10591,no of course not with a whole galaxy to explore millions of planets eons of time countless civilisations to meet
10592,well it is a fact jamie that i do tend to get involved with things
10593,yes yes but thats no excuse in their eyes
10594,were going to run away ive set the controls to take us to a planet on the outermost fringes of the galaxy
10595,well that is impossible
10596,its all right it cant possibly harm us
10597,were perfectly safe in the tardis
10598,oh my word its the time lords theyre breaking down the defensive mechanism weve got to get out of here
10599,well i know one place where well be safe if i can get us there
10600,were in outer space well just stop here for a while theres a chance we may have given them the slip    time lord
10601,oh oh oh very well if i must
10602,im trying to make a quick transference jump weve got to get away from here to somewhere safe ah were landing
10603,ill try oh the controls theyre moving by themselves
10604,its my own planet they have brought us here
10605,no not this time come along     time lord 2
10606,jamie do as he says      time lord 2
10607,the time lords holding a trial is a very rare event
10608,well normally they dont interfere with the affairs of other planets but they had to when i called for help
10609,well you and zoe may but i dont think i will  time lord 3
10610,cant you see hes just playing for time  time lord 3
10611,i never supported your scheme for one moment
10612,oh good im glad to see your sense of justice still prevails  even though theyve lost their sense of humour
10613,oh no
10614,youll never get away the time lords are too strong for you you neednt think im going to help you
10615,i cant i tell you the directional mechanism is faulty
10616,but i dont even know where your home planet is
10617,ill do my best but i cant promise anything jamie zoe hide your eyes run
10618,jamie they are not going to let us go
10619,i not only admit them i am proud of them while you have been content merely to observe the evil in the galaxy i have been fighting against it  time lord 3
10620,yes of course i do give me a thought channel and ill show you some of the evils ive been fighting against
10621,well isnt it enough
10622,jamie zoe
10623,oh thank you
10624,oh nothing much i expect theyll to make me listen to a long boring speech about being a good boy they like making speeches
10625,well thats easier said than done
10626,well you dont know the time lords jamie i do
10627,well oh all right but we may find it a bit difficult getting out of here
10628,forgotten
10629,yes yes of course
10630,no zoe not this time well goodbye jamie
10631,goodbye jamie
10632,i wont forget you dont go blundering into too much trouble will you
10633,goodbye zoe
10634,again now zoe you and i know time is relative isnt it
10635,shell be all right wont she
10636,what about jamie  time lord 3
10637,yes very efficient now then what about me
10638,what you mean that youre going to let me go free
10639,yes i suppose thats true earth seems more vulnerable than others yes
10640,oh good
10641,in exile
10642,but you you cant condemn me to exile on one primitive planet in one century in time besides im known on the earth it might be very awkward for me
10643,you cant just change what i look like without consulting me
10644,oh well thats not so bad but i warn you im very particular
10645,oh hes too old well hes too fat isnt he no hes too thin that ones too young oh now that wont do at all its ridiculous
10646,its not my fault is it is this the best you can do ive never seen such an incredible bunch
10647,no no no i never said that but i maintain i have the right to decide what i look like it could be very important on the earth people on earth attach a very great deal of importance
10648,is this some sort of joke no i refuse to be treated in what are you doing
10649,unhand me madam
10650,lethbridgestewart© my dear fellow how nice to see you again
10651,oh dear oh i cant have changed that much surely© oh i must see what theyve done to me can i borrow can i borrow a mirror please
10652,my shoes© where are my shoes© i must find my shoes
10653,you dont understand madam its most important
10654,all right all right i suppose you want to see my pass© yes well i havent got one and im not going to tell you my name either now you just tell brigadier lethbridgestewart that i want to see him well dont just stand there arguing with me man get on with it     security
10655,ah there you are my dear fellow i expect youre wondering how i found you here
10656,fortunately i had this with me you see it homes on the tardis oh there she is how nice of you to look after her for me do you happen to have got the key by the way
10657,ah ha but it will for me
10658,my dear brigadier its no earthly good asking me a lot of questions ive lost my memory you see
10659,thats delphon for how do you do delighted miss shaw delighted
10660,did i really© how terribly exciting
10661,ive no recollection of last night thats most unfair how could i possible what on earth are these
10662,plastic
10663,thats interesting i wonder what was inside
10664,then go away and let miss shaw and i get on with our work theres a good fellow look do i really have to call you miss shaw
10665,liz thats much better how many of these things actually came down
10666,and you found only fragments no whole ones
10667,then the answer to your questions obvious isnt it© by the time your search party arrived the rest of these things had been collected collected and taken somewhere the question is where
10668,well dont worry mdear weve done our best
10669,yes what results can you expect with this primitive equipment
10670,yes yes yes yes i know all that but what we really need is a lateral molecular rectifier
10671,no no no its true well you think that the tardis isnt big enough dont you© thats because you keep looking at it simply as a police box
10672,oh no not once you get inside it it isnt you see liz the tardis is dimensionally transcendental
10673,yes it would take far too long to try and explain that to you the important thing is that weve got to get this material analysed
10674,yes of course there is always the possibility that you might be able to persuade him to part with it
10675,im afraid hes going to be awfully cross with you
10676,well thats because the lock has a metabolism detector
10677,just testing i wanted to see if the controls
10678,yes the temptation was too strong my dear its just that i couldnt bear the thought of being tied to one planet and one time im sorry it wont happen again
10679,must i© the tardis no longer works as you saw
10680,yes well ive tried to help you the best way i can but i need more evidence i need more to go on
10681,you know brigadier i think perhaps a visit to that plastics factory would be in order dont you
10682,you know this really is most interesting we must examine it in the laboratory
10683,yes and until we know a bit more about these things i think we should move very cautiously
10684,no he didnt cut his way out but somebody cut their way in this canvas has been ripped from the outside
10685,if mister ransome is anywhere hell be at that plastics factory so i suggest that we go there immediately
10686,what exactly are you making here
10687,and can these mannequins actually move
10688,yes well ive think weve seen all we can possibly see here im sorry if weve been a nuisance
10689,here come over here you two look at this
10690,oh dear
10691,yeah or part of a brain an intelligence yes thats probably nearer the mark
10692,no once here it can presumably create a suitable shell for itself otherwise thered be no point in coming
10693,yes
10694,thats going to take time
10695,facsimile© of general scobie
10696,oh my goodness the waxworks
10697,yes oh excuse me
10698,are they supplying any more or is the tableau complete now
10699,well that was quick when did he visit the factory
10700,yes would you go to the trouble of winding it up and keeping it at the correct time© i think you and i had better have a word with lethbridgestewart
10701,well when he comes in tell him that ill call again later will you© goodbye
10702,oh theres nothing to be afraid of theyre only dummies i think its funny how their eyes seem to follow you isnt it
10703,no its only your imagination
10704,yes and his plastic facsimile is walking around somewhere now just
10705,quick back behind the curtain
10706,shush
10707,shush shush shush if you tell channing that were here the autons will kill us as i think they killed your friend ransome
10708,channing is controlling your mind you must resist him channing is your enemy the enemy of the entire human race
10709,now listen to me hibbert youve got to get away from channing get away and think now come to unit i can help you  channing
10710,its the facsimiles brigadier theyre moving theyve just left the waxworks
10711,by tomorrow they will have taken over the key positions in the entire country now youve got to move against that factory now    scobie 2
10712,and a red here it is hold onto those for a moment will you
10713,its started hasnt it
10714,now look you two we havent got much time
10715,well of course its going to work
10716,well how many men can you raise
10717,well then thatll have to do wont it©     doctor
10718,will you stand well back please
10719,perhaps i can settle this argument© i mean as to whether this really is general scobie
10720,i dont think so you see he was never really alive
10721,now
10722,on this planet there is a saying that it is never too late good gracious what on earth is this thing
10723,is that what you look like on your own planet
10724,so this thing is a sort of collective brain nervous system
10725,oh but im not human so if you live as a group you can be destroyed as a group surely
10726,i destroyed your facsimile of scobie therefore i can destroy all of you
10727,so you see mister channing with this device i can eliminate you
10728,oh no switch on liz liz switch on
10729,its not working
10730,you can switch off i think now liz
10731,only much more powerful of course
10732,money© my dear chap i dont want money ive got no use for the stuff
10733,must it© yes yes i suppose it must still theres no reason why you couldnt find me something similar is there© i mean it could persuade me to stay you know
10734,good when can we go and choose it
10735,smith doctor john smith  ltback to the episode listing
10736,twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe  liz
10737,outgrabe oh hello liz
10738,oh dont you be so disrespectful ill have you know this is a car of great character i was very lucky to get her
10739,yes certainly ive nearly finished my modifications i thought wed take her out for a trial run in a minute
10740,oh hes away isnt he investigating some scientists
10741,my dear miss shaw i never report myself anywhere particularly not forthwith
10742,no im sorry liz i wont go im far too busy
10743,twee twas brillig and the slithy toves
10744,caves what caves
10745,oh is it
10746,oh all right then ill drive you up there in bessie
10747,there bessie
10748,well there we are here hold that liz will you
10749,there you are at last
10750,and just where are we
10751,why more security
10752,look may i ask you why am i here
10753,hello doctor quinn
10754,why
10755,yes well thats all very well but what is going wrong
10756,naturally
10757,its the most extraordinary thing i cant seem to find my sonic screwdriver anywhere
10758,well its not worth fifteen million pins if it doesnt work is it
10759,splendid come on liz doctor quinn which way do we go
10760,to the left
10761,you have your own nuclear reactor then
10762,what happens if one of these power losses occurs at a particularly crucial time
10763,your nuclear reactor could turn into a massive atomic bomb
10764,a decision he might be reluctant to make
10765,are you all right liz
10766,ill join you later liz
10767,no no please do
10768,no not for a very long time
10769,until what
10770,you have your own doctor
10771,this technician was he badly hurt
10772,i wonder why
10773,i said i wonder why doctor quinn these power losses do they take any particular pattern
10774,i see well i wonder whether i could possibly check a fresh eye you know
10775,doctor quinn
10776,this log seems to be incomplete
10777,hmm
10778,no doctor quinn i dont think it does explain it look
10779,there at the bottom of the page by the string the binding youll see a tiny shred of paper some of those pages have been torn out
10780,ah liz any luck with those records
10781,yes depressing isnt it
10782,oh splendid just the chap i wanted to see now look this patient of yours spencer the one who was injured in the caves may i see him
10783,oh really whys that
10784,doctor meredith as an associate of unit i think you will find that i have the authority to do precisely as i please may i now see your patient
10785,thank you
10786,astonishing its quite astonishing
10787,was he much of an artist before the accident
10788,excuse me its absolutely amazing
10789,yes all right liz
10790,yes im all right hes just frightened thats all
10791,some kind of fear its absolutely incredible its thrown his mind back millions of years
10792,oh yes very homely
10793,where exactly is his office
10794,hes very conscientious isnt he
10795,i wish him joy of it
10796,on the contrary ive found enough to make me very very worried
10797,of course its evidence
10798,which turns him into a brilliant paleolithic cave artist what about the logs then those torn out pages
10799,ah
10800,lethbridgestewart what on earth is the point of my trying to discover things for you if you keep turning them down all the time
10801,youre not exactly a little sherlock holmes yourself are you
10802,theyre trying to close down the cyclotron without the nuclear reactions getting out of control  roberts  sector two closed down sir
10803,yes keep out of the way i should think
10804,sector three shut down  quinn
10805,any pattern
10806,really in what way
10807,you know its obviously something that only affects some humans otherwise theyd all crack up
10808,no well not really but it is the deepest part of the centre and its the nearest to those caves
10809,everything leads back to those caves liz davis was killed there spencer was frightened into becoming a cave man
10810,oh yes
10811,lets have a look
10812,oh good  immediate cause of death fracture of the cranium further observations unusual abrasions on the body strangely resembling scratches or claw marks presumably caused during fall claw marks                  brigadier
10813,well this all looks very exciting may i come too
10814,anybody would think you were disappointed that i didnt get lost
10815,well it produced results didnt it
10816,oh so you dont believe me
10817,well i hardly had time to draw its picture did i all i can tell you is that it was something very very large and something very very alive
10818,well it was certainly some kind of dinosaur certainly nothing that ive ever seen before though
10819,no i do not mean in museums well on second thoughts perhaps perhaps i do yes
10820,well its a possibility i suppose
10821,liz this time i think hes right
10822,thats typical of the military mind isnt it present them with a new problem and they start shooting at it
10823,its not the only way you know just blasting away at things
10824,i found the footprint over here somewhere
10825,well it was here well its dried up isnt it anyone can see that
10826,come on
10827,its all right old chap take it easy take it easy
10828,its all right old chap take it easy hold him there
10829,well obviously baker shot at something he thought was a man then something else attacked baker
10830,oh it seems very likely doesnt it
10831,no ill get back to the hospital with these blood samples in any case i can give a hand to carry baker
10832,brigadier youll be careful wont you after all you dont really know what youre following you know
10833,well see for yourself
10834,certain of the larger reptiles
10835,precisely
10836,oh no
10837,yes i suppose so
10838,no not yet so far our tests have proved inconclusive
10839,poor chap mind you he was behaving very irresponsibly blazing away like that
10840,yes but not by the thing that he shot at seems to me brigadier that youre missing the most important point
10841,that when baker was attacked and when i was attacked the thing was called off before it could do any real harm
10842,yes i know but in my opinion there are two kinds of creature down in that cave a large and ferocious one and a smaller much more intelligent kind that controls the first and may not be hostile
10843,yes and by that time it might be a little too late
10844,oh im so sorry i was looking for doctor quinn
10845,is he in his quarters
10846,dont worry my dear were all under a bit of a strain at the moment
10847,yes yes yes yes im sure he does its just that id rather like another word with him myself its about those power losses       silurian
10848,well thats it then theres nothing wrong with it
10849,with any of it cyclotron remote control mechanisms all of them functioning perfectly
10850,my dear man its a perfectly simple piece of machinery
10851,the power from your reactor like the mental state of your staff has been affected by some outside influence
10852,its more a question of what you propose to do about it until this influence has been discovered and dealt with this establishment should be closed down completely
10853,and to your career
10854,pompous idiot never could stand that man well brigadier all set to start playing soldiers are we
10855,and
10856,oh no these were made by something quite different smaller perhaps but very powerful
10857,yes but i imagine that squire attacked him with this  may have been cornered what about the mans wife
10858,yes well id like a word with her perhaps youd like to stay and do some forensic tests liz
10859,those claw marks they werent the cause of death you know
10860,heart failure you might say he died of fear
10861,and the chart please chart
10862,yes
10863,what happened then where did he go
10864,where
10865,in the barn
10866,still there
10867,all right officer we can manage
10868,well give her a moment shes just coming round
10869,now liz this thing what did it look like
10870,here you are liz come and sit on this there we are how are you feeling now
10871,well im not surprised
10872,doctor quinn how did you get here
10873,ah so youre feeling better then
10874,i understood you didnt feel too well
10875,whereabouts is your cottage
10876,well we dont know yet
10877,doctor quinn i wonder whether youd mind giving miss shaw a lift
10878,but i thought you were going straight back there
10879,hmm
10880,well
10881,hmm what direction did it come from
10882,yes im sure it came from over there lets go and have a look
10883,no this is smaller these are the footprints of a biped
10884,here look at these
10885,anyone bringing a car here would be miles out of his way
10886,oh nothing just a thought
10887,i thought you were going straight back to the research centre
10888,only i saw your car was still parked outside i thought perhaps you might have been taken ill again
10889,what a charming place mmm charming lovely old grandfather clock is this the living room oh yes very nice very nice had the place long have you
10890,centrally heated too eh
10891,yes still you do keep it very warm though dont you
10892,perhaps youd like me to look at it for you i like tinkering with these gadgets
10893,good good only it is rather like the reptile house in the zoo isnt it
10894,nothing i was just referring to the temperature of the room
10895,oh yes yes of course im so sorry to have taken up so much of your time
10896,my word its just as hot out here isnt it you really must get that thermostat fixed you know anything wrong
10897,youd save yourself a lot of trouble if youd let me help you they didnt catch it you know
10898,anything i must know more about doctor quinn
10899,thank you
10900,breaking open the cabinet mdear hes not going to leave anything important just lying around is he there we are now then what have we got here pitons notes whats this lets have a look at these
10901,some kind of a ball its got some markings on it have a look
10902,whats that let me have a look at that of course this is the world as it was before the great continental drift two hundred million years ago and these notes well theyre calculations on the age of the earth with particular reference to the silurian era
10903,that wont help doctor quinn will it
10904,im talking about the caves miss dawson
10905,theres something down there and i think doctor quinn knows what it is now look you must tell me what you know miss dawson before anybody else gets killed maybe even doctor quinn
10906,warned him warned him about what
10907,yes miss dawson
10908,never mind lethbridgestewart its too late now
10909,look i tell you gentlemen that the interference is definitely coming from those caves
10910,that major baker is precisely what we must not do at this present time
10911,i must say brigadier that im delighted that you didnt agree with him
10912,now look if youd just give me a little more time
10913,stupid bumbling idiots the pair of them
10914,to see doctor quinn i must persuade him to trust me before its too late
10915,hello
10916,no no im afraid not
10917,he was is very interested in potholing i thought his experience with the caves might have been useful
10918,oh yes that this establishment should be closed down completely
10919,and a planned cautious scientific investigation of those caves not an invasion by a lot of bigbooted soldiers
10920,sit down liz quinns dead hes been killed
10921,by a silurian
10922,probably the same creature that attacked you
10923,i spoke to it and it understood me
10924,reptilian biped a completely alien species
10925,liz these creatures arent just animals theyre an alien life form as intelligent as we are
10926,because i want to find out more about these creatures theyre not necessarily hostile
10927,yes but only to escape it didnt kill you it didnt attack me when i was in quinns cottage well dont you see they only attack for survival well human beings behave in very much the same way
10928,well im going back down into those caves see what i can find out
10929,no liz
10930,all right have it your own way but the fate be on your own head here you take a look at this
10931,its a map of the caves that i found in quinns office and look here hes marked a special route to somewhere
10932,no quinns marked a completely different route look
10933,yes all right here wait a minute
10934,well thats bakers
10935,liz wait a minute
10936,yes well from now on i think wed better stick rigidly to quinns route
10937,come on
10938,yes i know its very odd
10939,well well well
10940,yes well anyone can see that the question is how do you open it
10941,i cant understand why it didnt see us
10942,whats the matter
10943,well the silurians are reptilian you see theyve presumably created an environment inside there that suits them
10944,well i wish i knew theres only one way of finding out thats to get in there and see
10945,yes of course
10946,as a matter of fact i have quinns
10947,baker
10948,im sorry but were alone
10949,have they harmed you at all
10950,they can talk to you
10951,what do they ask
10952,look if they speak to you again cooperate with them a little find out all you can about them
10953,theyre trying to revive a silurian from some sort of deep hibernation maybe that explains the power losses in the research centre
10954,all right well get back for you as soon as we possibly can
10955,good luck
10956,lets try this way
10957,apparently not liz
10958,ah doctor lawrence just the man i wanted to see now tell me have you just had a power failure
10959,i see thank you
10960,yes well ive got no time to chat to undersecretaries permanent or otherwise i must find the brigadier
10961,you may ask
10962,brigadier you are not to take your men into those caves ive been down there and i know whats happening
10963,huh spoken like a true soldier
10964,well we dont know maybe there are thousands
10965,look mister undersecretary surely this is a government matter it cannot be decided at this level
10966,if you go down there with a party of armed men theres bound to be fighting
10967,well leave them alone let me try and make contact with them
10968,well so far theyve only attacked in selfdefence at least lets give them the benefit of the doubt
10969,miss dawson did these silurians tell doctor quinn anything about their intentions
10970,theres only one thing i can do ive got to get down into those caves and warn the silurians
10971,if the brigadier wont listen to reason liz maybe the silurians will
10972,ahem im sorry to burst in on you like this
10973,i came here to warn you that humans are about to enter your caves
10974,no you dont understand no ive come here to ive come here to warn you
10975,dont worry helps on the way i only wish it werent
10976,i came here because i want to help you
10977,look people are coming many people are coming here i want you to meet them in peace
10978,well theyre soldiers but they wont attack you unless you attack them first
10979,because i want there to be peace between you and the humans this is their planet now
10980,i was simply trying to prevent a massacre
10981,i had to take that risk at least theres a chance they wont start killing each other
10982,please you must listen to me i want to talk to you
10983,youre making a terrible mistake i can stop you from being destroyed
10984,look youve got no idea of the fighting power of the humans
10985,theyve got bombs now that can wipe out whole continents
10986,please please let me out of here let me out of here cant you see i can do you no possible harm
10987,but you must see this is a highlydeveloped and overcrowded planet which now belongs to man
10988,then why did you stay down here
10989,a small planet yes of course but dont you see that small planet was drawn into the earths orbit and became the moon your catastrophe never happened
10990,but i still dont understand why you stayed down here
10991,the power station at the research centre
10992,no you mustnt otherwise therell be the most terrible war
10993,but if you trust me i think i can persuade the humans that you are prepared to live with them on this planet in peace
10994,oh yes i think there is you see your people are used to living in extreme heat whereas these areas on earth are of little interest to man i believe with your advanced technology that you could build cities in parts of the world that man has hitherto completely ignored
10995,well theyre not my people but i think i could convince them on the condition that you release those trapped men first
10996,and you to them someone has to make a move otherwise this whole thing will end up in complete catastrophe
10997,thank you for your trust in me i only hope it will not be in vain
10998,you have my assurance that i shall tell them of your desire for peace yes
10999,thank you
11000,you once had a great civilisation i didnt realise how advanced
11001,baker why thats splendid
11002,but this is diabolical
11003,is there any cure for this disease
11004,yes yes of course but you must release me at once
11005,that is precisely what we must not do
11006,now everyone move well away from major baker now keep right back from him right back
11007,major baker you are ill you are very very ill
11008,keep back from him look at your wrist look at it       silurian jr
11009,this whole place should be closed down and put in strict quarantine immediately
11010,yes and about time too well ive got to get down to the research centre and try to find an antidote
11011,you just dont understand do you doctor lawrence
11012,that is precisely what i want but if this bacteria isnt contained there wont be anybody left to negotiate
11013,thats the worst thing that could have happened why didnt you stop him
11014,brigadier weve got to go down to the hospital straight away before baker spreads that infection
11015,meredith does not know what hes dealing with nobody does now please do as i say
11016,yes the first one
11017,this man is dead he was killed by an alien disease
11018,right youd better get this place quarantined im going back to the laboratory
11019,have you finished with those prophylactic injections yet
11020,its all we can do at the moment
11021,well now wait a minute liz
11022,liz
11023,yes all right have it your own way
11024,did what hurt oh yes it was agony
11025,no not yet im still waiting for that scanning microscope
11026,well im glad to hear it now then how about that hospital
11027,good and your own men
11028,splendid has anybody else gone down with the infection
11029,yes well id be very happy to lose him what about that chap from london masters
11030,we may be able to contain it the question is can we cure it excuse me
11031,cant be sure brigadier we cant be sure of anything
11032,thank you
11033,gone where
11034,liz
11035,go with him please anyone whos been in contact with masters has got to be quarantined he may spread that disease all over the country
11036,look please hurry this is very important you know
11037,yes i think so now then have they found masters
11038,yes well hes got to be found and put into quarantine at once
11039,no i dont think you are so far the antibiotics have held the disease in check have you finished good splendid
11040,thank you
11041,well its hard to say really i think theyll lie low for a while and let the disease really get to work
11042,brigadier at all costs we must avoid a pitched battle
11043,well dont forget that one of them released me which is giving us our only chance of defeating this disease
11044,yes look brigadier ive got a great deal of work to do
11045,thats excellent thank you
11046,one of those drugs maybe a combination of them will probably cure this disease the question is which
11047,by finding out more about that bacterium ive already analysed it but i need to know more about its effect can you get me a blood specimen from someone whos been infected
11048,i only hope i shant be too late
11049,good splendid who did you take it from
11050,oh how is he
11051,ive no idea we may be getting somewhere now though
11052,my dear girl some of these drugs are so new they dont even know their properties yet
11053,no thats no good you know im beginning to lose confidence for the first time in my life and that covers several thousand years
11054,yes thats a possibility lets try
11055,yes well i expect those antibiotics are wearing off youd better get down to the sick bay and have another jab
11056,im all right
11057,liz i am all right
11058,eureka
11059,i think ive found it
11060,well it works in the laboratory now lets see whether it works in practice
11061,thats excellent excellent yeah theres a good chap thats it now youll want to telephone that formula to london ill go and write it out for you straight away
11062,they will all survive
11063,yes and soon all the humans will be immune to your epidemic your plan has failed as your leader wanted it to fail
11064,but you cant do that you cant exterminate a whole species
11065,im afraid you wont be able to do that thanks to you the humans are no longer making power their generator has been switched off
11066,do as he says brigadier or theyll kill us all
11067,miss shaw is a scientist if i am to do what you want i shall need her help
11068,stop
11069,no
11070,very well ill do as you want
11071,trying to save your lives now keep out of the way and keep quiet
11072,the power source is over here
11073,if im to help you i must know
11074,oh for what purpose
11075,but if this process gets out of hand it will destroy all life on the planet
11076,yes well well need to stoke up the reactor miss shaw ill need your help please
11077,miss shaw i want you to feed uranium into the reactor all right
11078,liz i know what im doing please do as i say
11079,lower in number one rod  liz
11080,now you should be getting enough power now to get your disperser unit into operation
11081,as you wish liz now
11082,yes i know
11083,theres going to be a massive explosion and a colossal radiation leakage
11084,well done brigadier
11085,i cant
11086,well i exaggerated a bit but i had to push the reactor past the critical stage or theyd never have believed me wed better get out of here at once
11087,why not
11088,give me time liz give me time there you are try that now
11089,yes i know ill try fusing the control of the neutron flow now stand well back and cover your eyes
11090,i managed to close down the reactor
11091,well done brigadier now then
11092,im trying to find out how this hibernation unit works i must know if were going to revive them again
11093,yes not all at once you understand one at a time so that we can reason with them theres a wealth of scientific knowledge down here brigadier and i cant wait to get started on it
11094,now dont forget brigadier nobody is to go into that silurian base
11095,miss shaw and i will be back as soon as possible with some testing equipment and probably some other scientists
11096,yes dont forget brigadier nobody is to go into that base all right ill see you tomorrow
11097,no no no its just a minor technical fault well soon put that right
11098,the brigadier hes blown up the silurian base
11099,and you knew
11100,but thats murder they were intelligent alien beings a whole race of them and hes just wiped them out
11101,well im trying to reactivate the tardis time vector generator
11102,well it could sent you into the future if it starts working again particularly if youre standing there
11103,liz good grief
11104,oh there you are
11105,well we both got caught in the time warp field and were projected into the future
11106,yes but only about fifteen seconds
11107,no no no you vanished first i only seemed to have vanished because you went into the future and i wasnt there yet
11108,yes
11109,look
11110,oh and the brigadier thinks its his business oh well i suppose hes got to do something to occupy his mind now that hes blown up the silurians    wakefield
11111,theyve just linked up
11112,no not a sound  wakefield
11113,that sound ive heard it somewhere before
11114,thats just it i cant remember
11115,dont you understand its all up here in my mind the informations here but i cant reach it wed better go there
11116,the space centre its not far
11117,my dear fellow i simply dont happen to have a pass because i dont believe in them thats why
11118,that sound have you heard it again
11119,you will
11120,have you got a recording of that message
11121,quite right neither have i now that sound have you got a recording of it
11122,no they havent theres nothing anybody can do for the time being
11123,now you listen to me that sound was some kind of a message and its going to be repeated
11124,nonsense man youre doing nothing of the sort theres nothing you can possibly do
11125,by exercising my intelligence now since we didnt reply the message would obviously be repeated now weve got to break down that code and answer them
11126,the mans a fool how can i possibly tell who the message is from until i know what it says let me explain this to you in very simple terms
11127,might find me useful
11128,yes yes of course look my dear fellow do please forgive this intrusion but you really must let me decode those messages it could prove of vital importance to the safety of your astronauts
11129,no not now
11130,that was the reply brigadier i shall need worldwide triangulation immediately
11131,the first ones yes but not that last one that was completely different now weve got to find out where that was coming from
11132,the message was repeated perhaps the reply will be all we can do now is wait  wakefield
11133,and algonquin
11134,arecibo
11135,cambridge
11136,oh thats good
11137,well if its from earth this could give us the country but thats not accurate enough we must pinpoint the exact location
11138,something coming through
11139,yes london
11140,can i get a map of london on this thing
11141,a map of london its very important
11142,useless gadgets
11143,whats the exact location
11144,look if im to help you people i need full cooperation
11145,i specified the need for computer time if im to decode those messages i need a computer
11146,yes so hes just informed me but hes being totally noncooperative
11147,yes
11148,lets see what hes got to say for himself this time             doctor
11149,so you understood the message
11150,what are you going to do with it
11151,since you insist
11152,careful brigadier hes frightened
11153,yes of course
11154,are you all right
11155,i think we can safely leave him to the brigadier
11156,what
11157,oh the tape
11158,oh here it is here
11159,no no no no that was simply transmigration of object theres a great deal of difference between that and pure science you know now then what about decoding this tape let me see now
11160,yes yes thats just what i was looking for
11161,oh thank you
11162,brigadier what did you find at the warehouse
11163,and
11164,well id like to have a talk with him
11165,why dont you sit down old chap
11166,anything found on him
11167,clothes
11168,youve been very thorough havent you
11169,dont you realise that the men you are working with were seriously interfering with our space project and thereby endangering the lives of three astronauts
11170,brigadier youre wasting your time
11171,yes i know but hes not going to tell us and i think weve got more important things to do
11172,looking after you all right are they have you had a cup of tea
11173,thats good stand to attention when youre talking to me and call me sir
11174,just as i thought sergeant arent you
11175,no hes acting under orders
11176,well thats it for now id better go and see how liz is getting on with the decoding
11177,no no no if theyre going to attempt a reentry they must make at least one earths orbit ill be back in time for reentry are you coming
11178,yes theres no pattern to it at all its nonsense
11179,yes
11180,wonder what
11181,never mind all that ask it what two and two make
11182,liz ask it
11183,how long have you known doctor taltalian
11184,oh its typical i never did trust those stupid things
11185,no no no they always lose radar contact in the last few seconds
11186,well done old chap well done
11187,theyve locked it from the inside
11188,take it back to the space centre
11189,all right
11190,im afraid i cant
11191,yes well if you want me to get out of the way im afraid youll have to help me old bessie seems to have stopped
11192,i brought it here
11193,didnt you find two angry men stuck to my car
11194,cant have got that force field strong enough yet
11195,thank you hello yes liz yes right ill be down straight away ill tell you all about it later liz thinks shes on to something
11196,youre right liz this is a definite attempt at pictographic communication
11197,what with this symbol repeated twice and this one repeated four times oh no
11198,no one on this world but an alien intelligence so different this is the only way they can communicate
11199,i think that its high time the brigadier and i had a talk to the top man
11200,i should have thought that was obvious every step we take someones ahead of us
11201,look that is quite beside the point the question is who else is involved
11202,oh yes weve got the capsule back all right and its safely installed at the space centre but the astronauts still refuse to come out
11203,is that all youve got to say sir james sweep it all under the carpet
11204,any response yet
11205,let me try hello van lyden what is the capital of australia  van lyden
11206,what let me see
11207,liz try them again
11208,well well well a tape recording
11209,well someone wanted us to believe they were still inside there that tape recorders not a standard part of their equipment is it
11210,then somebody put it there didnt they
11211,well to gain time now suppose the astronauts were still in there when it landed and later they were removed
11212,i take it you didnt order this
11213,well there you are then a bogus patrol turns up clears the area and removes the astronauts at their leisure
11214,yes perhaps the same people who replied to that message
11215,yes ill come with you
11216,yes what is it
11217,i dont think you can sweep all this under the ministry carpet sir james someone in authority has done this
11218,we havent come here to offer explanations sir james weve come to demand them from you
11219,you mean youre going to tell us the truth
11220,oh
11221,does that include sending coded messages to mars probe 7 and kidnapping three astronauts
11222,yes but why all this extraordinary behaviour well surely radiation is a normal hazard of space travel
11223,well it seems to have been a question of the right hand fighting the left doesnt it brigadier
11224,well it hasnt eased mine
11225,i should like to take a look at these mysteriously irradiated astronauts for myself if i may
11226,nevertheless i would still like to see them
11227,perfectly safe were they
11228,liz what were those exact radiation figures again
11229,thank you
11230,possibly
11231,i realise the importance very well general carrington that is why i must be allowed to continue my work undisturbed
11232,oh thanks you know its the most extraordinary thing those astronauts were emitting radiation like walking reactors
11233,yes i know
11234,well i can tell you where your three astronauts are
11235,theyre still in orbit
11236,no you saw three spacesuits i dont know what came down in recovery 7 but it certainly wasnt human
11237,i do
11238,i should do that as quickly as possible if i were you
11239,must you
11240,and why do you think that is
11241,its the most extraordinary thing the radioactive contamination has almost vanished if you cant get recovery 8 ready in time you can use this capsule
11242,whos it from
11243,how very morbid
11244,no im going to stay and get this capsule fully operational
11245,youre back soon
11246,but liz has just gone to meet you we received a message asking us to join you you didnt send it
11247,anyone can buy a foreign newspaper general
11248,let me look
11249,and hair combs
11250,ive told you where your astronauts are general theyre still in orbit
11251,is it when your professor heldorf had the aliens in his care he started to record some sort of radio communication impulses
11252,then why didnt heldorf talk to them
11253,yes well i dont think so well im going down to the space centre use the computer i trust your man taltalian wont hold a gun on me this time
11254,general how many times must i tell you your astronauts are still in orbit my objective is to find out what these aliens are trying to say to us
11255,youre not armed i hope
11256,thank you im much relieved
11257,no not yet may i have the use of your computer
11258,id like to programme these impulse records if i may
11259,well if i knew i wouldnt need a computer would i
11260,well i suspect some sort of pattern
11261,well it mustnt taltalian it mustnt
11262,thank you hello yes yes it is who is this
11263,no someone threatening to kill her if i dont stop interfering well lets get back to work shall we
11264,these impulses are mathematical formulae for building an electronic device
11265,ill have to build it to find out wont i
11266,well how are these people going to know what im doing unless somebody tells them
11267,you for instance
11268,and you are being continually obstructive
11269,did you or are you involved with the people who are really behind this
11270,the people who kidnapped miss shaw who kidnapped the three astronauts
11271,no not yet
11272,well i thought id offer you some sort of alternative a ruthless investigation by the brigadier or a few quiet words with me and your name kept out of things
11273,i think you do taltalian and im going to give you a little time to think it over right well if youll excuse me i must see what can be done about building this machine think over what ive said i shall expect to hear from you very soon
11274,no not a scrap
11275,something even his computers dont have intuition i think i rattled him
11276,yes i know i heard him and i didnt believe a word of it
11277,well first they try keeping us in the dark altogether and when that didnt work they fall back on some prepared cover story contagious radiation indeed
11278,i dont know perhaps ill know better when ive built this device
11279,advanced electronic equipment i need it at once
11280,good ill be in my laboratory i suppose theres no news
11281,mmm
11282,yes of course
11283,is that all
11284,ill take the rocket up for you myself
11285,my dear man ive spent more time in space than any astronaut on your staff not ill admit in the rather primitive contraptions that you use but ill manage
11286,i can also withstand considerably more gforce than most people even though i do say so myself
11287,tests simulations anything you like when that recovery capsule is ready ill take it up
11288,ive saved you a journey havent i
11289,have you thought over what i spoke to you about
11290,and
11291,very well
11292,yes all right
11293,a lot of good it did me and him
11294,im not sure that it was look at this see this is set to zero taltalian must have thought that he had plenty of time to get away when in fact this bomb was set to go off instantaneously
11295,yes taltalian was a weak link you know i think his employers wanted him out of the way
11296,yeah im afraid so
11297,well its something very similar to the machine im trying to build and taltalian had one all the time
11298,i tell you it converts radio impulses into human speech the aliens in heldorfs laboratory were trying to communicate with him
11299,i never believed they were now if i can only build the other half of this thing
11300,yes probably if you were to hurry up with those parts that ive ordered
11301,thank you hello yes sir james
11302,most certainly
11303,you might if you were to tell me the truth sir james the whole truth
11304,very well sir james thank you he wants me to come and see him he says hes going to tell me the whole truth
11305,sir james
11306,mmm
11307,deflected by some sort of force field i should think
11308,not with bullets
11309,somebodys using these creatures brigadier theyre not free agents they were brought to earth for some purpose
11310,possibly or is that we are supposed to think
11311,has that ever been done before
11312,hasnt the death of sir james quinlan made things any easier for you
11313,yes well dont lets bother about that for the time being
11314,yes yes i know i told you everything would be all right
11315,what have you got against it
11316,all the more reason for me to go up in that rocket and find out whats happened up there
11317,you havent answered mine why are you opposed to this launch
11318,since we dont know whats up there wouldnt it be more intelligent to carry a man rather than a bomb
11319,then i suggest you take the matter up with his successor when hes been appointed
11320,right
11321,well there seems to be some sort of official opposition to my going general carringtons trying to stop the launch
11322,right i must be off
11323,hello brigadier what are you doing here
11324,what is this place
11325,not very impressive for ones last sight of earth is it  woman
11326,goodbye brigadier and thank you
11327,yes yes everything seems to be working all right  cornish
11328,well i still think you could add a higher proportion of m3 and remember the extra gforce wouldnt worry me
11329,ah
11330,its about time too
11331,thank you mister cornish im very much obliged
11332,if you mean can i see it the answer is no
11333,all right all right more haste less speed mister cornish
11334,nonsense man your three astronauts are in there injecting air into the tunnel now
11335,ill try
11336,where am i  alien
11337,what are you talking about
11338,do you know where you are
11339,please do you know where you are
11340,you think youre on earth at the space centre
11341,i came to take you back to earth
11342,now please listen to me youre not on earth nor are you at the space centre youre prisoners in an alien spaceship
11343,you came up here in recovery 7 but you never made the journey back something happened
11344,yes
11345,why have you taken them prisoner
11346,ambassadors
11347,ambassadors
11348,what you tell me is appalling the authorities on earth had no knowledge of this
11349,nevertheless you must believe me now let me go back to earth and i will give you my personal assurance that your ambassadors will be returned to you
11350,from the information that youve given me ill find them now please you must let me try
11351,these three men can i take them back with me
11352,yes look ill see what i can do about getting you out of quarantine as soon as i possibly can
11353,yes yes all right dont worry ill look after everything
11354,right im ready when you are  cornish
11355,im none the better for your attentions liz
11356,yes and getting better by the minute how are you did they hurt you at all
11357,well i dont blame you
11358,yes i know ive been aboard their spaceship ive talked to their captain
11359,they have some kind of translation machine
11360,oh no no thats a much simpler model that would only receive oneway signals
11361,i dare say if i had the proper equipment i was going to build one never did get a chance to get round to it
11362,you expect me to help you
11363,well i shall need a lot of expensive equipment
11364,very well thank you
11365,is there a way out
11366,right lets get on with that list
11367,well if we cant get out to the brigadier we must bring the brigadier to us
11368,i think the general knew all along
11369,not particularly no
11370,then somebody disobeyed your instructions didnt they
11371,given the necessary equipment yes
11372,it depends on what youre trying to do
11373,liz well general
11374,when do you expect this invasion
11375,they told me that their intentions were peaceful that these three beings here were ambassadors
11376,youre convinced their intentions are hostile then
11377,ah so thats when you met them when you were on a previous mars probe
11378,yes but they didnt know their touch would kill human beings
11379,so it was you who sent for those three ambassadors was it
11380,was sir james quinlan in on this
11381,well i must say youve been very thorough general
11382,yes yes i understand you had to do what you had to do
11383,yes yes ill build your machine for you
11384,mmm hmm
11385,look im not building a crystal set you know
11386,look if you let them out how am i going to test it
11387,what more killing
11388,come on liz lets get on with it we havent got much time you know         wakefield
11389,all right
11390,right switch on the power liz will you
11391,all right right lets try and test this thing
11392,well ive boosted it as much as i possibly can  just go over there will you liz
11393,see if they react at all
11394,well well just have to keep on trying wont we
11395,oh were just about to test it liz you stand by the controls will you
11396,now we are trying to convert our speech into your radio impulses can you understand me we are trying to convert our human speech into your radio impulses can you understand me
11397,can you understand me please try to answer
11398,look how many times must i tell you i am not joining you in a programme of bank robbery
11399,what kept you
11400,what for
11401,weve got to stop him at once
11402,weve got to get in there somehow
11403,you know i think hes right
11404,now were going to return you to your own people but first we need your help to prevent a catastrophe
11405,open the gates please try not to harm anyone
11406,yes general i understand
11407,my dear chap theyre still up there but dont worry theyre all right theyre quite safe now weve got to make an exchange
11408,well send these three up in recovery 7 theyll send down our three astronauts
11409,well simple well use pure m3 variant and dont forget theyre not susceptible to gforce
11410,well goodbye mister cornish ive got a lot of work to do in my own laboratory
11411,well here you are heres miss shaw shes much more practical than i am goodbye brigadier
11412,goodbye gentlemen have a nice trip  ltback to the episode listing
11413,hello brigadier making yourself at home
11414,fine thank you fine
11415,no no no dont tell me let me guess
11416,yes well if its true i can see why you grew that moustache
11417,what do you mean
11418,allow look miss shaw may have the misfortune to work for you brigadier i am a free agent
11419,what
11420,and do you know who did the killing
11421,do you know anything about him
11422,oh its still warm
11423,if the wrench had been subjected to intense energy it might have disturbed its atomic makeup
11424,well its a matter of great scientific interest my dear fellow first penetration of the earths crust well naturally im interested
11425,yes well id concentrate on finding that rigger if i was you well excuse me i must get back to work
11426,yes in a way some related experiments you know
11427,our liver playing us up again this morning is it professor
11428,welcome to the inferno mister sutton
11429,well i think that certain people ought to pay a lot more attention to the warnings of this computer
11430,yes mind you im not wild about computers myself but they are a tool if you have a tool its stupid not to use it
11431,give that more lateral compensation old chap or youll blow the main condenser banks cost thousands to put that right waste of valuable time and money hmm
11432,good morning any sign of slocum yet
11433,nasty business that
11434,funny gadgets
11435,good
11436,yes but i think youll find they only confirm what we already know
11437,oh the usual friction between sir keith and stahlman
11438,theres been a murder liz
11439,its a dreadful business a murder without a motive right lets get back to work shall we
11440,indeed i am thats why we came here
11441,look liz look without the tardis i feel rather lost a stranger in a foreign land a shipwrecked mariner
11442,in a minute
11443,right weve been over this many times you know exactly what to do dont you
11444,well then take up your position and ill switch the nuclear power through
11445,liz please
11446,now at my signal give me first stage power and then full boost a fraction later
11447,ill think of something i hope
11448,switch to first stage power full boost liz
11449,yes i still feel dizzy i seem to be in one piece anyway
11450,im not sure i seemed to be in some sort of limbo there was a barrier i couldnt break through we must make another trial run
11451,because of all that i wonder where i was exactly where i was going
11452,well next time we must ensure that i do
11453,theres been a nuclear power surge actually we experienced it ourselves earlier it must have gone quite mad at the reactor
11454,where was the body found
11455,anywhere near the reactor
11456,professor we think we know whats wrong
11457,well im afraid i was wrong professor
11458,its not so much your liver as your general disposition brigadier come on
11459,look
11460,look theres nothing to be frightened of old chap
11461,pistol pistol
11462,abnormal resistance abnormal strength thats not all
11463,look theyd better not touch the body for a while its radiating a good deal of heat
11464,heat brigadier like the wrench that killed that technician like that switch over there
11465,there dont seem to be any major injuries
11466,possibly i dont know
11467,mmm
11468,some sort of retrogression of the body cells i think
11469,neither do i not fully not yet
11470,yes the process was relatively slow and it wasnt completed
11471,why wasnt the metamorphosis completed
11472,i have
11473,krakatoa the sundra straits during the volcanic eruption of 1883
11474,there could be
11475,wyatt
11476,hello what have we got here
11477,well i doubt whether it will cool down
11478,i was just venturing an opinion
11479,krakatoa actually
11480,i wish i could hear it liz
11481,i wonder if it screeches
11482,why something interesting
11483,a question
11484,isnt anybody going to pay any attention to that computer out there
11485,you talk about the thing as though it was your maiden aunt
11486,yes well ill tell you something that should be of vital interest to you professor
11487,that you sir are a nitwit
11488,no professor dont
11489,i hope so because its message is perfectly clear
11490,come and see for yourself it warns that drilling should be stopped immediately well look at it man are you blind
11491,you please yourself sir ive done the best i can to convince you i may as well get back to my own work
11492,oh why not
11493,thats an incredibly childish attitude to take
11494,so am i sir keith
11495,liz go and check the trigamma circuits on the console again will you
11496,look please dont ask any questions theres a good girl
11497,professor what are you doing with that microcircuit
11498,that computer is a threat to you isnt it it could prove you wrong now give me that microcircuit
11499,venusian karate its very effective hold it long enough and the subject remains permanently paralysed
11500,oh very well
11501,shall i tell him or will you
11502,look dont you start asking me questions just keep your eyes open and follow me
11503,would you mind telling us what you have in your left hand pocket
11504,i tell you he had a microcircuit in his pocket
11505,yes well i suppose ive got something better to do with my time anyway
11506,did you replace them
11507,good good
11508,oh just a little contretemps between myself and stahlman nothing of any importance
11509,oh i dont think so
11510,liz it wasnt the console that was to blame it was that nuclear power surge
11511,yeah would you do me a favour
11512,nip down to the control centre will you and feed these figures into the spare bank of the computer theyre some epsilon coordinates
11513,yes i know but im a bit tired
11514,hmm oh im so sorry
11515,unity is strength whos been messing about with my equipment
11516,liz liz its me dont you recognise me whats happened to everyone round here have you all gone mad what are you doing in that ridiculous getup
11517,all right liz a jokes a joke
11518,liz this is ridiculous       stewart
11519,what on earth are you doing in that getup  benton 2
11520,i beg your pardon
11521,look your name is lethbridge stewart
11522,brigadier lethbridge stewart
11523,all right brigade leader have it your own way and you are elizabeth shaw
11524,what are you talking about
11525,my name you ask me my name after all the years that you and i well now wait a minute yes i think im beginning to see whats happened here might i suggest you just call me doctor
11526,smith doctor john smith
11527,yes well this is where we come to the difficult bit
11528,i come from a parallel spacetime continuum
11529,yes well let me put it this way ive been transported from another world one that is running almost parallel to this one
11530,now now look wait you are elizabeth shaw
11531,not a scientist
11532,oh this is fascinating so many similarities yet so many differences
11533,tell me how far down is the shaft that you are drilling
11534,and professor stahlman is his liver still playing him up and sir keith how is sir keith yes now theres a man who might understand
11535,only that hes the executive director of this project yes i should very much like to see him
11536,indeed i would failing that professor stahlman hes an opinionated oaf i know but at least hes a scientist
11537,three hours twenty two minutes youre a lot more advanced with the drilling here  benton 2
11538,difficult why  stahlman 2
11539,excuse me but what about this computer  stahlman 2
11540,yeah missing microcircuit do you think professor  stahlman 2
11541,look may i ask what is going to happen to me
11542,without a trial
11543,well look you cant possibly have the authority to do a thing like
11544,republic
11545,then whats happened to the royal
11546,pity a charming family i knew her great grandfather in paris do you know i remember on one occasion  benton 2
11547,staffed by slave labour i take it well youre all in very grave danger
11548,before that computer broke down it was transmitting danger signals was it not
11549,and what about harry slocum
11550,only that he went berserk and started killing people
11551,look i am not a spy ive seen it all before
11552,in another world
11553,youre just wasting time
11554,but i dont exist in your world
11555,im delighted to hear that
11556,proper little bureaucrat arent you cant shoot me unless youve filled in all the forms is that it
11557,my dear young lady if that computer was functioning it would warn us that we all have very little time left
11558,tell me have you ever seen anything like this before
11559,come on come on where are you  benton 2
11560,thank you section leader
11561,nevertheless thank you just the same oh incidentally i think i may be able to repair your computer for you
11562,i should say it was everybodys concern
11563,wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute i think this might be it  benton 2
11564,you see the computers already aware of the situation and is assessing its immediate problems    stahlman 2
11565,i was not sabotaging it i was repairing it
11566,yes the pressures and the heat are overwhelming the present velocity of the drill head
11567,well you can disperse the heat and the pressure
11568,by creating a reverse vortex at the bottom of the shaft  stahlman 2
11569,now look you two are just wasting time what i suggest is this we push all the coolant down the output pipe and then draw up all the debris from the bottom of the shaft through the inlet pipe
11570,of all the ungrateful nitwits
11571,enough
11572,of sorts yes
11573,ive already told you i come from a parallel spacetime continuum a twin world of this
11574,your counterpart in the other world would tell you that im not in the habit of telling lies elizabeth
11575,its not that she looks like you she is you i do wish i could make you understand this
11576,do shes a scientist
11577,did you ever think of becoming a scientist yes yes i can see that you did
11578,simply that her mind process runs along a similar parallel to yours doesnt that strike you as significant
11579,look elizabeth please try and think whatever they taught you in this bigoted world of yours youve still got a mind of your own now use it before its too late
11580,good im very glad to hear it
11581,maybe youll give me a medal posthumously
11582,no not particularly do you
11583,elizabeth i am trying to help you you said the emergency was over well it isnt as long as you people go on drilling youre rushing into terrible danger
11584,youre wasting your time you know i can stand a great deal of this childishness
11585,yes im sure you have but it wont do you any good
11586,how can i give you information that doesnt exist
11587,i came here on my own i came by accident i came here the tardis console slipped me sideways in time slipped me sideways in time
11588,that stahlman hes accelerating the drilling
11589,i see youre wearing white cotton gloves director may we ask why  stahlman 2
11590,why the bandages professor  stahlman 2
11591,listen to me youre seriously ill youve been infected  stahlman 2
11592,please dont push ill have you know that your counterpart in the other world was a nice sociable sort of chap sergeant  benton 2
11593,oh yes it is   benton 2
11594,look i am sick and tired of answering all these idiot questions
11595,i have answered them more times than i care to remember
11596,ive told you the truth if your minds are too narrow to accept it thats not my fault  benton 2
11597,trying a change of technique
11598,first you try to bully me and then you switch on the charm secret police routine seven stroke four
11599,even though im a spy
11600,oh no
11601,look i am not mad i am not a spy and im certainly not a political demonstrator you just wont listen will you
11602,your counterpart had some intelligence i wish i could say the same for you
11603,sergeant sergeant sergeant
11604,this man is sick he needs medical attention
11605,you must stop this countdown before its too late
11606,do you hear me you must stop it  stahlman 2
11607,if you break through the earths crust now youll release forces you never dreamed could exist
11608,listen to that
11609,thats the sound of this planet screaming out its rage
11610,youre not thinking of going in there are you
11611,theres never been a bore like this one
11612,somehow i dont think he feels the heat as we do
11613,well here goes
11614,a piece of pipe held by stahlman
11615,yes
11616,i think he likes it in there
11617,yes not to mention those technicians
11618,very little now im afraid tell me mister sutton how thick are those walls
11619,compared to the forces that you people have unleashed an atomic blast would be like a summer breeze
11620,yes well theyll be no better off in the long run wherever they go
11621,well the heat will have fused the main circuits ill have a look
11622,yes
11623,too late mister sutton youve unleashed the energies of the earths core
11624,no substance on this earth is strong enough to withstand those pressures
11625,well the heat and the pressuresll continue to build up until the earth dissolves in a fury of expanding gasses just as it was billions of years ago
11626,maybe a few weeks maybe only a few days
11627,dont go near him brigadier dont go near him hes probably more interested in getting to the drill head than he is in us
11628,it wasnt just your bullets that killed him you know
11629,yes the fire extinguisher they cant stand cold
11630,yes im afraid so
11631,gentlemen stop arguing just save your energy
11632,you could help me to save a world you know
11633,not this one elizabeth the other one
11634,this other world exists brigade leader its as true as the one you know yourselves
11635,yes you the brigade leader stahlman sutton petra all of you you could save your other selves
11636,with the aid of the tardis
11637,yes
11638,yes possibly if i could use your nuclear reactor for power
11639,not necessarily work on their project is not so advanced as yours i may be able to stop them before they penetrate the earths crust
11640,thats right
11641,no but shes a very important part of one
11642,back in the world where i came from i er i removed the console to make some trial runs
11643,theres always a certain amount of energy left in the storage unit
11644,you said you were going to help me
11645,if youd only try and use the little intelligence you have
11646,proof demonstration what do you think i am a conjuror have can i give you a demonstration when i havent got now wait a minute
11647,if im to do it ill drain the storage unit completely very well you shall have your demonstration
11648,well are you satisfied or do you think it was all done with mirrors
11649,just a pitiful few seconds into the future i only wish it could have been more
11650,dont be a fool man i cant possibly go anywhere the storage unit is completely flat
11651,perhaps
11652,no no i couldnt possibly do that
11653,it would create a dimensional paradox it would shatter the spacetime continuum of all universes
11654,you mustnt
11655,no whatever you do dont raise that heat shield
11656,no dont go anywhere near him dont go near him
11657,theyre acclimatising themselves they dont want to get too far away from the heat
11658,well make a break for your office
11659,into the office
11660,believe me mister sutton there was nothing we could have done
11661,worse than that hell have become one of them the heat will accelerate the process
11662,to keep them away from the heat the hotter it is the stronger they grow
11663,not necessarily i do have a plan for getting us out but it all depends on those creatures out there
11664,i should say all of ten minutes
11665,well if were going to get power to the tardis console well have to connect it up to the nuclear reactor
11666,well the air conditionings still working so powers still getting through
11667,can you boost the output
11668,but it can be reset
11669,well weve still got a weapon to use against them
11670,no i dont i mean the fire extinguisher
11671,well there are other fire extinguishers in central control
11672,splendid well well fight our way into central control using this while mister sutton holds them off with his coolant ill repair the master switch
11673,well stop talking so much
11674,thats enough dont waste it thats enough i said its stahlman
11675,no i think hes just paralysed hell probably come to again when the temperature rises
11676,right
11677,right off you go
11678,dont worry about me ill stay and repair the master switch
11679,the heats made a pretty good mess of this
11680,are they now
11681,slow but sure mister sutton
11682,mmm hmm
11683,if i get back
11684,i dont know maybe somebody will listen to me there sir keith for instance
11685,here perhaps in the other world maybe not
11686,thats it i only hope it works shall we go mister sutton
11687,hurry along my dear fellow hurry along
11688,now mister sutton and i had better start work on the power connection will you be long doctor williams
11689,be as quick as you can
11690,well youd better wait here
11691,no im afraid not now ill need some tools and a length of heavy duty cable
11692,right come on lets get on with it
11693,right come on
11694,the console mister sutton the console
11695,what did you expect some kind of space rocket with batman at the controls
11696,er well it wasnt exactly a journey in the accepted sense of the word it sort of slipped me sideways into your dimension
11697,theoretically yes
11698,i hope so now fix the connector to the cable will you
11699,a few seconds are all i need mister sutton
11700,right you can connect up the cable now
11701,were not relying on luck mister sutton but skill
11702,you must try and be patient
11703,yes i know
11704,well that appears to be that i doubt whether they would have listened to me anyway
11705,whats the matter
11706,yes of course you did my dear
11707,one cant do more than that mister sutton
11708,hysteria wont help us brigade leader
11709,listen to that do you want to end your lives fighting like animals
11710,ill come with you
11711,its coming through all right and its gaining rapidly
11712,well done doctor williams
11713,i cant its impossible
11714,i cant i literally cant itd create a cosmic disaster
11715,do you think i want to id give anything to save you all
11716,youll have to shoot me brigade leader i have no intention of taking you
11717,i cant its still too erratic
11718,number two number two output pipe blown
11719,number two output pipe
11720,very dangerous very dangerous number two output pipe blown
11721,theres only one thing one thing to do reverse reverse all systems reverse all systems immediately
11722,reverse all systems
11723,yes
11724,liz it is liz
11725,fine brigadier you know you really do look better with that moustache
11726,yes im very well aware of that oh the pulse seems to be more or less normal at a hundred and seventy yeah yes both ticking away quite nicely although the right one seems a fraction faster still thats only to be expected isnt it
11727,same time same place only a different dimension it was a parallel world liz terrible things are happening there terrible things it wasnt this earth and yet it was i didnt go backwards into the past or forwards into the future i slipped sideways
11728,brigade leader that technician the one who went berserk and started killing people have you found him yet
11729,and stahlman hows he
11730,but no worse
11731,hows the drilling
11732,sir keith
11733,so youre not dead
11734,but youre not dead
11735,thats excellent excellent
11736,so not everything runs parallel
11737,yes of course of course an infinity of universes ergo an infinite number of choices so free will is not an illusion after all the pattern can be changed
11738,now look
11739,now wait a minute im not sick im not in need of a doctor and im not a raving idiot
11740,sir keith unless we do something very very quickly indeed theres going to be a disaster
11741,because ive already seen it
11742,do you hear me close down this operation now
11743,now listen to me all of you you are not to attempt to penetrate the earths crust
11744,get out of my light now stop this drilling
11745,stop this drilling you dont understand do you
11746,youve got stop this drilling
11747,stop this drilling
11748,now liz listen to me computer theres a micro circuit missing
11749,wheres stahlman
11750,good then stop this infernal drilling well what are you waiting for
11751,stop this drilling and start filling up that shaft
11752,stahlman get back sutton the fire extinguishers
11753,petra the drill close it down
11754,hurry hurry
11755,thats the buffer controls at the drill head come on
11756,i can only try
11757,sir keith i think youd better give orders for that shaft to be filled in straight away
11758,shine on martian moons up in the sky join in liz come on
11759,oh are you leaving sir keith
11760,well im not sorry to hear that what about the nuclear reactor
11761,oh but theres time for me to use it just once more i hope
11762,thank you sir keith by the way hows sutton and miss williams
11763,nothing like a nice happy ending is there
11764,goodbye sir keith
11765,goodbye brigadier
11766,oh pity well come on liz if weve going to link up to that nuclear reactor wed better get a move on
11767,the trouble its caused you
11768,and a fat lot of notice you all took
11769,brigadier there are times when you strongly remind me of your other self i shall leave at once
11770,naturally
11771,with the work that we did today the tardis console is now fully operational
11772,goodbye liz i shall miss you my dear but ive had about all i can stand of this pompous selfopinionated idiot here
11773,a few seconds forward in time and a few hundred yards due east in space
11774,the rubbish tip
11775,er brigadier my dear fellow i wonder whether i could borrow a couple of your stalwart chaps to give me a hand in bringing the tardis back its landed in rather an inaccessible position
11776,yes well we dont want to bear a grudge for a few hasty words do we no not after all the years that weve worked together now come long my dear fellow put on a smile just remember all    ltback to the episode listing
11777,not today thank you
11778,i said not today thank you
11779,dealt with it© youve ruined it
11780,three months delicate work and now look at it you hamfisted bungler
11781,my dear young lady steady state microwelding always creates more smoke than fire
11782,then what the blazes are you doing in here
11783,dont you know this area is strictly out of bounds to everybody except the tea lady and the brigadiers personal staff
11784,oh no
11785,how do you do miss grant© i really dont think youre suitable
11786,fire fighting© yes well im sorry my dear but what i need is a scientist
11787,yes im sure you did but even so
11788,thats all right
11789,mmm
11790,oh what was
11791,well thats the nestenes energy unit it should never have left this building
11792,the brigadiers an idiot i knew i should have destroyed that thing but somehow it would have felt like murder
11793,theres precious little to joke about miss grant that thing is appallingly dangerous
11794,liz was a highly qualified scientist i want someone with the same qualifications
11795,well whats the girl doing here anyway© units no place for trainees
11796,so you tried to palm her off onto me well it wont work brigadier ill have a properly qualified assistant or none at all
11797,good
11798,well now wait a minute
11799,miss grant i er i er well i dont this is er a bit difficult for me to say but er thank you jo i can see youre going to be of great help to me
11800,let me see that  wed better get down there right away
11801,is that where the sabotage took place
11802,well thats where youll find me then no miss grant you stay here with the brigadier
11803,sarcasm always was a weak point with you wasnt it may i say that i think you look quite ridiculous in those clothes
11804,oh© why
11805,look if youve come down merely to be rude
11806,oh© one of our people
11807,that jackanapes all he ever does is cause trouble
11808,how very kind of them
11809,i refuse to be worried by a renegade like the master hes a hes an unimaginative plodder
11810,yes well er yes well i i was a late developer
11811,a volatiser if that thing should fall
11812,well youd better think of a witty way of dealing with it
11813,wheres lethbridge stewart
11814,huh a fat lot of use thatll do
11815,yes yes he must
11816,ask captain yates he had the job of clearing up the mess last time
11817,a nestene is a ruthlessly aggressive intelligent alien life form
11818,they manifest themselves as a disembodied mutually telepathic intelligence
11819,too late captain theyre here already
11820,brigadier look that unit must be discovered within the next hour
11821,well try the plastics factories man
11822,too late brigadier ive boiled out the contents the weapons that you have on earth are quite nasty enough as it is
11823,stop her thats a bomb
11824,my dear sergeant if that box hadnt been tied you wouldnt be here to receive any complaints
11825,you thought that under hypnosis it was impossible for a subject to be persuaded to do anything that was against his nature
11826,well its a fallacy captain the master can completely control the human mind
11827,jo wake up wake up jo this is the doctor youre amongst friends
11828,please be quiet
11829,all right all right
11830,calm down jo calm down were quite safe

11833,mmm hmm
11834,yes what sort of a room
11835,yes
11836,an office© was it a factory office
11837,yes well where was that factory© do you know the name of the factory
11838,well try and remember
11839,hello jo are you feeling better
11840,thats good
11841,what on earth for
11842,oh that was nothing to do with you my dear that was the master
11843,yes well dont itll only make things worse leave your mind alone something may pop up of its own accord
11844,you know brigadier your methods have all the refined subtlety of a bull in a china shop
11845,oh© wheres the circus now
11846,i havent been to a circus for years i think ill go myself
11847,no thank you brigadier no ill go on my own if you dont mind dont want a lot of soldiers crashing about do we
11848,ill need some photographs of that man philips
11849,philips professor philips
11850,this is outrageous let me go at once
11851,doctor actually
11852,a strange name how longs the horse box been here
11853,all right my dear chap theres no need to do that im perfectly prepared to answer all your questions and er what was the question
11854,im sure of it where is he
11855,how much are they paying you
11856,nonsense gentlemen never talk about anything else now listen to me if youre prepared to forget that youve ever seen me and let me go i will reward you very handsomely
11857,i can get money quite easily
11858,do you recognise that man
11859,that is a photo of a missing government scientist if youve had anything to do with concealing him you are in very serious trouble
11860,maybe youre not asking the right questions
11861,youve got a very distorted sense of humour havent you
11862,the strong silent man eh
11863,what the blazes are you doing here© i told you to stay at headquarters
11864,oh where
11865,it isnt exactly a horsebox it just happens to look like one
11866,no more than theres a policeman inside my police box
11867,wait philips wait dont move jo
11868,wait you just listen the master is controlling your mind you must resist him you can resist him you are professor george philips of the radio telescope research centre you must resist him
11869,well that didnt take long did it
11870,now wait a minute listen to me now listen to me all of you
11871,thank heavens nothing damaged
11872,its a good thing you chaps turned up when you did otherwise we might have been lynched lethbridge stewart must have sent them yes its nice to know he can use his head once in a while
11873,it isnt tarminster
11874,excuse me officer could i see your warrant card©           brigadier
11875,theyre autons bullets cant stop them
11876,the enemy intention is to occupy your planet i should have thought that was quite obvious
11877,naturally oh you have finished with me now i hope
11878,oh
11879,oh well having reached that brilliant conclusion how about getting on with it© captain yates is my car back yet
11880,oh good thats something anyway
11881,do you know jo i sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms
11882,bye bye jo
11883,whats wrong with being childish© i like being childish
11884,from field section one continuous watch maintained nothing to report business appears to be proceeding normally no unusual activity everything checked and found in order report completely negative nothing to report so far will continue to search its worthless absolutely worthless
11885,days of exhaustive investigation by the brigadiers band of bloodhounds and what have they discovered© nothing absolutely nothing the incompetent imbeciles
11886,no news from any of those plastic factories
11887,my dear girl the master is scarcely likely to advertise what hes doing
11888,i will not give up hes lying low somewhere and weve got to find him
11889,the master© never hes too conceited
11890,yes well im not in the mood for stories
11891,i think youll find sir that im qualified to deal with practically everything if i choose
11892,now just a moment my good man we at unit are very busy with a number of extremely urgent matters
11893,the brigadier has a great deal on his plate you cannot expect his exclusive attention for your petty concerns
11894,whos in charge of you pen pushers these days© old tubby rowlands isnt it
11895,i was saying to him in the club only the other day wrong sort of chap is creeping into your lot tubby i said
11896,no no of course not say no more about it right now brigadier whats your problem
11897,cause
11898,any connection between the victims
11899,what about the first two
11900,mrs farrel i do realise how distressing this must be for you
11901,yes i know believe me it is terribly important you know you could help us save hundreds of lives
11902,what sort of developments
11903,what was his name
11904,i knew it
11905,is there anything else you can tell us about this colonel masters
11906,yes of course but can you remember anything that your husband said about him© anything at all
11907,what sort of dolls
11908,could we see it mrs farrel
11909,thank you
11910,what is©  mrs
11911,yes
11912,right now lets take a look at this thing
11913,forceps
11914,jo get in touch with scientific supplies will you© tell them i need these things straight away
11915,yes asphyxiation cause unknown
11916,the nestenes change the molecular structure of plastic captain yates they energise it in some way and turn it into quasiorganic matter almost like flesh and blood well its inert at the moment something must have activated it
11917,good how long will it be
11918,what© do you mean that they havent got a scanning molecular structure analyser in stock© oh really brigadier you should keep this place better supplied you know i cannot work without proper equipment
11919,yes well just as well itll give me more time to look at mister farrels plastic factory
11920,lethbridge stewart i can assure you
11921,its open
11922,its plastic brigadier and any plastic artefact anything at all can in the nestene sense of the word be alive first a doll then a flower
11923,oh have a look at that desk old chap will you
11924,you never know there might be something there to give us a lead
11925,mmm
11926,well maybe hes going on a works outing
11927,look out auton
11928,i usually am
11929,jo where were you when this thing started moving
11930,and what about you captain yates
11931,yes well something must have fetch a tin of what
11932,are you trying to tell me that you were going to make cocoa in my lab
11933,yes well sergeant  now wait a minute you didnt by any chance use my bunsen burner did you
11934,well thats it then heat this thing was lying alongside my bunsen it must be triggered off by a predetermined temperature
11935,hello yes© what is it
11936,oh very amusing
11937,what is it this time
11938,what about them
11939,who are
11940,did they say how many theyd given out
11941,that captain yates is what im trying to find out
11942,no
11943,my word you look very fierce
11944,good
11945,well thats curious was the master with them
11946,afterwards
11947,the military mind at its most scintillating faced with a problem they blast it off the face of the earth
11948,captain yates
11949,an hour and a half
11950,yes yes a nose and a mouth
11951,jo look
11952,short wave radio you must have triggered it off with that walkietalkie of course they must be planning to set them all off at once with a gigantic radio signal if i could only find out the direction of the signal
11953,jo be careful jo
11954,get in touch with that idiot brownrose see if plastic daffodils were found at the scenes of any of those deaths oh and ask him if anybody was using short wave radios will you
11955,you all right
11956,now why wasnt this stuff found on the bodies
11957,no no indeed not youve come here to kill me of course
11958,how very comforting
11959,how did you get in here
11960,vicious complicated and inefficient typical of your way of thinking
11961,tell me how do you intend to activate these flowers
11962,and in the confusion the nestenes will land their invasion force
11963,wait dont shoot
11964,dont worry hes not going to kill me
11965,if you fire that thing you will never be able to leave this planet
11966,im not bluffing and my hand as you can see is not empty if you kill me you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your own tardis you recognise it i feel sure
11967,touch�
11968,jo
11969,jo you know where we are dont you
11970,no i only hope the brigadiers keeping his eyes open got it
11971,jo its a pity escapology wasnt part of your curriculum
11972,well done
11973,thats it im free
11974,brigadier those daffodils
11975,the radio telescope we must stop him reaching the control hell open the channel for the nestenes
11976,if only we could shut off the power
11977,if were finished then youre finished too
11978,do you really think that that thing will distinguish between you and us
11979,not unless we change the polarity
11980,get on to the transfer bank ill switch the power through are you ready
11981,right now
11982,yes but only just another minute and wed have been too late
11983,after him quick
11984,dont be too sure
11985,i told you not to be too sure
11986,oh no
11987,belonged to my tardis yes yes ive been trying to repair it for months
11988,yes im afraid so
11989,im not as a matter of fact jo im rather looking forward to it  ltback to the episode listing
11990,well youre right about the castle bit it used to be a fortress in the middle ages
11991,thanks jo
11992,youre on camera
11993,abandon hope all ye who enter here
11994,morbid lot of sensation seekers
11995,scientific curiosity my dear
11996,somethings been worrying me about this keller process ever since i first heard of it ah the curtain is about to go up
11997,good morning
11998,it all depends what you mean by progress doesnt it
11999,people who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground i think
12000,it doesnt
12001,oh yes yes please do
12002,where do they go after that
12003,which is now full of these negative or evil impulses
12004,i knew there was something evil about that machine
12005,satisfactorily be blowed
12006,i admire your confidence sir
12007,then would you kindly explain sir that unfortunate mans reaction
12008,in other words you dont know
12009,unit sir was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to mankind and in my view this machine of yours is just that jo
12010,is he dead
12011,perhaps but i doubt it might i suggest an immediate investigation into his past medical history and a post mortem
12012,bites and scratches yes i know
12013,yes i agree jo but not just yet now let me get that post mortem first itll give me more to go on
12014,hmm
12015,all about what
12016,and you are still convinced this keller process is working normally
12017,yes yes ive seen him
12018,yes i know but i still dont like it
12019,interfering with the mind governor its a dangerous business
12020,professor kettering it is everyones concern  summers
12021,yes yes yes but what did he die of
12022,anything in his medical history
12023,oh which ones
12024,rats
12025,tell me these marks on his face on his face and neck these bites and scratches could they have been caused by rats
12026,but linwood is dead
12027,no professor kettering because of this machine
12028,if i were a scientist let me tell you sir that i am a scientist and i have been for several thousand jo
12029,oh come on man come on
12030,well
12031,like the rats
12032,yes a good idea how long would you say hed been dead
12033,yes exactly
12034,this machine has the power to affect mens minds governor and its growing stronger
12035,yes maybe but nevertheless its dangerous and it should be destroyed now
12036,i wonder how many deaths itll take to convince them
12037,yes yes all right well id better make this machine safe
12038,on my own
12039,perhaps not
12040,but i prefer to work that way tell me how long has this machine been installed
12041,i see did he have an assistant
12042,jo jo what are you doing here
12043,look i told you to take that directly to the governors office
12044,so are my instructions jo so are my instructions you might have been killed
12045,well it was there jo at least it was until you distracted it your coming in broke its grip on my mind let me see that report
12046,so he drowned in a perfectly dry room
12047,fire
12048,well some time ago jo i witnessed a terrible catastrophe a whole world just just disappeared in flames well this machine picked that memory out of my mind and used it to attack me
12049,neither was the water nor the rats yet linwood is dead and so is professor kettering we believe what our minds tell us to jo
12050,because those idiots in authority wont let me thats why im trying to find a way of controlling it so if youve quite finished asking questions
12051,nonsense i cant possibly leave stangmoor
12052,im telling you im not leaving
12053,venusian karate i think youll find that a lot harder than you imagine young man
12054,murdered yes all right captain yates ill come with you
12055,look jo for once in your young life do you think you could do exactly as i ask
12056,now go and see the governor tell him to lock and bar that door no one is to enter this room no one do you understand
12057,yes yes im rather afraid ill have to try and keep out of trouble will you
12058,come along captain yates what are you waiting for
12059,i see youre in your usual sweet affable mood brigadier
12060,right now brigadier would you kindly tell me what all this fuss is about
12061,and youll back up my report to the home office calling for a complete ban on the keller process
12062,and youll get in touch with the home secretary and make sure that he takes some action
12063,my dear lethbridge stewart your word is my command you know that you only have to ask
12064,well where on earth do you think youre going

12075,another mysterious death with unexplained marks on the face and body theres got to be
12076,off for another little trip captain yates
12077,the what
12078,i thought theyd outlawed those things
12079,with the peace conference going on its not the most tactful time to be trundling rockets about is it
12080,chinese girl what chinese girl
12081,brigadier what chinese girl
12082,thats it then thats the link
12083,when emil keller installed his machine at stangmoor prison he had a chinese girl with him as an assistant
12084,coincidence my foot youd better put out a general alert for that chinese girl brigadier shes got to be found and quick
12085,look operator ive been waiting some considerable time now for my call to stangmoor prison
12086,yes all right yes ill hang on theres some trouble there with the lines
12087,chin lee where
12088,no brigadier
12089,a collective hallucination gentlemen nothing more whos that
12090,no but hes suffering from acute shock
12091,yes
12092,well its a telepathic amplifier
12093,no not caused them no it merely picks up the impulses and projects them through chin lees mind
12094,well unless im very much mistaken from the keller machine at stangmoor prison
12095,wa ai pengsan wa ai chin lee was being used by someone who was trying to drive this world into war
12096,yes i will if i can
12097,hang ahn pengsan
12098,may god go with you also
12099,yes i know but it was in your mind it was only in your mind now i want to ask you some questions
12100,yes about emil keller and your visit to stangmoor prison
12101,rise and shine brigadier ive brought captain chin lee here to see you
12102,right now brigadier i think youll find that captain chin lee can cast considerable light on whats been happening
12103,yes well tell him to be careful with his er cargo
12104,posthypnotic block his usual technique
12105,well think man who else would make a deliberate attempt to plunge this world into war using equipment and techniques not even developed on earth like this
12106,otherwise known as emil keller
12107,well let her go of course well shes not a criminal anyway she cant do any more harm now that ive got this
12108,is jo all right
12109,well
12110,yes
12111,passes television
12112,dont point that thing at me man it might go off im here on official business i understand theres been some trouble here
12113,i was going there anyway
12114,hardly hows the riot going
12115,do you and er where is miss grant to be found
12116,is she indeed well let me tell you this that if you harm so much as one hair of her head ill
12117,why the delay i take it that im to be killed eventually
12118,you want me to help you with that machine of yours professor keller you want to be careful of that thing you know one day its going to end up killing you
12119,huh
12120,oh what other business
12121,well its a lunatic scheme still thats only to be expected
12122,i see
12123,jo jo where are you     doctor
12124,may i ask the purpose of this charade
12125,you know this is all very tiresome
12126,then why dont you
12127,you wanted you wanted to know how long i could hold out against that machine well the answer is i cant nobody can
12128,no no
12129,be that as it may i know the secret of that machine inside is a creature that feeds on the evil of the mind and very soon itll feed on yours
12130,thats wrong wrong metabolism itd probably kill me jo im all right im all right jo just just let me rest let me rest
12131,well done my dear now perhaps we can do something about getting out of here
12132,i do have remarkable powers of recovery dont i come on
12133,theyll be expecting us to try and make a break for it
12134,no not while theyre all chasing around let them cool off for a bit well try again later
12135,there is but its locked
12136,that my dear jo is the thunderbolt captain yates is escorting it i hope
12137,everything hes hoping to steal it
12138,why not its the safest place at the moment theyll never think of looking for us here besides i need more time to think ive got to find out a way of dealing with that alien creature out there
12139,the one inside the keller machine
12140,i do
12141,its a sort of mind parasite that feeds on evil the deadliest threat to mankind since the beginning of time
12142,mmm
12143,right nows our chance
12144,i didnt mean our chance to escape jo i meant our chance to get into that process chamber and deal with that machine once and for all
12145,perhaps the creatures learned to move come on
12146,yes well before you pull that trigger
12147,look look behind you
12148,look behind you
12149,well we couldnt have tempted its appetite
12150,well i imagine it detected a higher concentration of evil in mailer theres something to be said for a pure mind after all eh jo
12151,yes all right jo jo wait a minute wait
12152,look weve got to stop the master from launching that missile now come on barnham you come with us
12153,well there doesnt seem to be anybody about lets take a look outside  you wait here for a minute
12154,let him go let him go
12155,look mailer what
12156,mailer why are you helping the master
12157,the ma er er keller or whatever he calls himself
12158,oh whats he promised you
12159,do you really think hes going to keep those promises
12160,let us go and ill do the best i can for you
12161,shush shush shush shush
12162,yes well the trouble with this game is that its too simple in any case im more used to playing three dimensional chess
12163,i suppose youre going to ask me to control that machine of yours again
12164,yes well i cant ive told you before nobody can
12165,well even if i could why should i help you
12166,yeah most of them hard cases that were helping you
12167,my own
12168,well its only a theory but i think there may be one way to inhibit that machines power of movement
12169,well wheres the thing now still wandering about
12170,well i shall need a lot of equipment you know
12171,all right ill give it a try
12172,im well aware of the urgency of the situation thank you right excuse me will you
12173,would you mind bringing that plug with you please
12174,and the coil
12175,thank you
12176,im going to try throwing this coil over that machine in there if i can get close enough to it without being killed that is
12177,well i want you to operate these controls here and switch on to full power when i call out
12178,if all goes well it should set up an electric current in the coil alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the human brain
12179,i dont know but i think itll confuse the creature enough to take away its power of movement anyway
12180,so do i
12181,thank you right you know what to do
12182,now
12183,now
12184,it wont hold it for long you know that things intelligent soon itll work out what happened and find a way to deal with it
12185,yes thank you jo im fine im fine
12186,yes temporarily
12187,i am physically and mentally
12188,i doubt it not after what happened last time
12189,well we shouldnt have thrown our breakfast at them should we
12190,oh no thanks jo you have it ill do without food for a while
12191,oh all right cheers
12192,huh did i ever tell you about the time i was in the tower of london
12193,no
12194,well i shared a cell with a very strange chap called raleigh
12195,yeah sir walter raleigh
12196,he got into some trouble with queen elizabeth elizabeth the first that is he kept going on about this new vegetable of his hed discovered you see called the potato one day he sat down pointed a finger at me
12197,yes i only hope they can gain complete control before mailer starts killing the hostages
12198,hmm oh yes
12199,ah come to give yourself up
12200,well
12201,thank you brigadier but do you think that for once in your life you could manage to arrive before the nick of time
12202,i see youve changed your job
12203,what about the missile
12204,no
12205,yes well apart from losing the master and the missile youre doing very well brigadier
12206,well it comes to the same thing surely
12207,his name is barnham hes the last man to undergo the keller process and you can see what its done to him hes got the mind of a child dont worry about him you leave him to jo he trusts her right lets take a look of this map of yours  yates
12208,mmm
12209,does it
12210,you may not find the master all that easy to mop up brigadier
12211,well dont forget hes got that rocket full of nerve gas he can point it at any city in europe
12212,no not for the moment ive got to work out a way of destroying that machine of his if i can step up the voltage in that coil
12213,yes yes all right
12214,right thats it that should just about do it i think
12215,well it must stored up its energy and blown all the circuits lets have a look
12216,well its stronger than ever now how on earth am i going to stop it
12217,no thatd never work twice the things too intelligent in any case i doubt whether id get near enough to it without being killed
12218,barnham get out of here get back
12219,barnham come back come back come back
12220,over here
12221,dont be frightened by it dont be frightened thats it thats it as long as youre here it wont hurt us right stay there stay there sit yourself down thats it
12222,the mind of evil jo i should have realised that creature feeds on the evil impulses of the brain
12223,no the machine extracted them all something in his mind acts as a screen and neutralises it so long as hes here were perfectly safe
12224,no no these creatures are incredibly resilient jo itd take an atomic explosion or an enormous charge of electricity to destroy that
12225,well im going to see im going to see sergeant benton will you wait here will you be all right until i get back
12226,yes i know ill be as quick as i possibly can all right now jo will look after you
12227,yes please do its all extremely urgent
12228,yes im quite sure it is but neverthe
12229,hello yes
12230,you have gathered correctly
12231,in spite of what ive said do you still intend to fire that rocket on london     doctor
12232,the dematerialisation circuit from your own tardis
12233,i am hand me back that rocket and ill return your circuit  master
12234,sergeant can you contact the brigadier for me
12235,get onto him at once tell him hes got to cancel that attack
12236,but understand that you mustnt go anywhere near him if he catches sight of a uniform hell fire that rocket
12237,what do you mean just in case its our only chance  brigadier
12238,i sincerely hope so im going back to miss grant
12239,you just dont understand do you jo once he gets that circuit back hes free to roam through time and space wed never catch him
12240,jo will you stop stating the obvious what did you say
12241,well thats it thats the answer weve got the machine and weve got our friend barnham
12242,with a little help from you old chap we can destroy this machine and the master at the same time
12243,come on old chap come on
12244,thats it all right now dont forget whatever you do dont drop it now hang on to it tight pick it up
12245,now mind his feet
12246,what did you expect the master may be a scoundrel but he is a scientist hell have disconnected the abort mechanism
12247,oh has it arrived
12248,yes thats it
12249,its where hell escape to that worries me what right have we got to let his loose on some other planet
12250,my dear brigadier of course i have a better plan
12251,no of course not no its just that bessie had broken down
12252,you know bessie
12253,thats very clever
12254,oh yes here
12255,how do i know that you wont take the circuit and fire the missile anyway
12256,no i dont think so
12257,hai
12258,come on
12259,yes i know jo i know
12260,well how do you think i feel
12261,yes here have some coffee
12262,yes weve probably killed off that machine all right but im not so sure about the master
12263,yes thats true
12264,yes but what if it wasnt supposing the master found it
12265,the master yes
12266,im extremely sorry to hear that
12267,so we wont be seeing you for quite some time  master
12268,his usual threats
12269,have i jo hes got his tardis back hes free to come and go where he pleases while im stuck here on earth  with you brigadier  ltback to the episode listing
12270,my dear mister chinn if i could leave i would if only to get away from people like you
12271,and your petty obsessions england for the english good heavens man
12272,not to the world
12273,theres no point in discussing the master i keep telling you hes left earth by now
12274,yes well er
12275,variable mass thats interesting  radar 2
12276,yes somewhere on the south east coast i should imagine
12277,all set to destroy it brigadier© whatever it is
12278,i see shoot first and think afterwards is that it©  radio
12279,hardly seems sporting does it©  radar 2
12280,dont you think youd better abort© what goes up must come down again the warheads abort man abort
12281,gone© it hasnt gone anywhere brigadier its just arriving
12282,artillery© well your missiles couldnt find their target what chance bazookas
12283,as far as i can gather with these primitive instruments here the device has buried itself deep underground so theres not much that anybody can do about it even if it is a bomb
12284,you know i would have said that that was a heartbeat     axos
12285,more of a cry for help than a threat wouldnt you say
12286,before you start annihilating the thing why dont we just take a look at it
12287,jo im sorry not this time
12288,right gentlemen shall we go in
12289,brigadier brigadier brigadier
12290,even radiation© why then were you crippled by solar flare
12291,and yet you still ran out of fuel
12292,and unlimited power
12293,jo are you all right© whats happened
12294,its all right my dear dont be frightened
12295,yes tremendous material advantages but i doubt if even axonite could increase the growth of human common sense but since you seem hell bent on getting hold of it i suggest the best thing to do is to restrict its use to your laboratories until weve made a full analysis of all its properties
12296,hmm quite a quandary
12297,perhaps he got here ahead of us
12298,i only hope youre right jo
12299,and this brings in the whole output of reactor one
12300,with the ultimate aim of making travel in time possible
12301,yes as a matter of fact thats the trouble i cant
12302,most inconvenient actually you know i was thinking if youd really like to take a look at my tardis maybe i can arrange to have it brought down
12303,but dont you see© its the simplest way to break it down
12304,look all we have to do is take the axonite put it in the light accelerator and crack it down into particles
12305,if it is a thinking molecule it should analyse itself all we have to do is switch on and read the printout
12306,its been programmed not to dont you see its deliberately resisting analysis well isnt it
12307,say what
12308,i told you so particle acceleration its the only answer if youre not prepared to risk your own equipment why dont we try mine
12309,a certain malfunction of the drive system yes but the other components are all right we could put them through the main reactor
12310,its the only thing left to do isnt it© if you could persuade the powers that be
12311,right
12312,filer so you got away©  filer 2
12313,doc
12314,are you quite sure it isnt
12315,good come along
12316,i tell you brigadier they replicated bill here
12317,yes thank you jo
12318,bill was the master in axos or not
12319,which was why they sent filer the fake filer after me
12320,the whole things just a pack of lies brigadier
12321,yes quite look weve got to stop chinn getting hold of that stuff
12322,and what is your decision
12323,which are
12324,my dear winser i hope youll forgive this unauthorised use of your precious equipment but in case there is an accident im making this recording of what not to do i am about to place the axonite in the light accelerator
12325,dont touch that
12326,jo lie still theres nothing we can do
12327,oh© how©  axon man
12328,well obviously your plan entails some sort of time limit  axon man
12329,look for the thousandth time i tell you i am not a time lord  axon man
12330,jo
12331,very well    axos
12332,theyre not getting the power through  axos
12333,lets get out of here while that creatures disorientated come on thats it come on
12334,jo stop it be quiet stop it
12335,jo try and stop it
12336,try and stop it dont let it get a grip on your brain dont let it get to your brain listen to me answer me what are three sevens
12337,twenty one keep answering three sevens times four
12338,minus thirty five© think jo think jo
12339,twice that© twice
12340,plus ten
12341,divide by nine
12342,divide by four
12343,three sevens
12344,yes quick
12345,going somewhere
12346,i dont think you can stop it
12347,good thank you
12348,brigadier can you set up a constant watch on that spacedome
12349,look bill i think i can defeat axos but i must have the masters help
12350,oh dont worry jo ill keep him in good order all right with this
12351,actually there isnt one
12352,exactly we either escape together or we die together
12353,yes well we havent got much time whats your decision
12354,good well youre the mechanic whats the answer
12355,the trigger mechanism from the light accelerator
12356,yes of course
12357,well itd better not take too much time right you get on with the repairs ill go and work out some course coordinates
12358,just in case you were thinking of leaving without me     axos
12359,good yes as a matter of fact we are
12360,drop that filer
12361,sorry jo ah brigadier just in time to say goodbye
12362,im sorry jo we must
12363,if were going lets go
12364,this is as far as were going for the moment
12365,thats right yes  axos
12366,come on come on you must take the load you must    axos
12367,well its perfectly simple brigadier a time loop is er well its a time loop one passes continually through the same points in time passes through the same yes well the axons said they wanted time travel and now theyve got it
12368,you know i cant give up jo its far too important
12369,now dont you start
12370,well i didnt expect there would be no his tardis is working again now he could be anywhere in space and time
12371,youre wasting your time brigadier
12372,your agents are always picking up traces of the master
12373,well look what happened last time the man they arrested turned out to be the spanish ambassador well there you are thats done it
12374,ive made myself a completely new dematerialization circuit one thatll bypass the time lords homing control i hope
12375,oh no no ive been doing all this work for fun
12376,a game
12377,why not step inside and see for yourself
12378,yes thats because the tardis is dimensionally transcendental
12379,it means that its bigger inside than out now then
12380,what
12381,well i cant jo i think were taking off
12382,im trying to somethings operating it by remote control
12383,i cant jo weve taken off
12384,at the moment were nowhere
12385,were outside the space time continuum
12386,look
12387,ive no idea well just have to wait until we emerge
12388,i dont know jo i just dont know
12389,that is where we are
12390,because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous thats why ill just check
12391,is it what
12392,no no its quite healthy similar to earth before the invention of the motor car
12393,i can but try
12394,thats an alien world out there jo think of it
12395,look do you realize how long ive been confined to one planet
12396,well of course it was true before i was stranded on earth i spent all my time exploring new worlds and seeking the wonders of the universe
12397,then lets find out dont you want to set foot in another world
12398,theyre tracks made by some sort of machine this planet must be inhabited after all i think well get a better view from up there come on what are you waiting for
12399,come on jo nothing to worry about
12400,they look like some sort of prefabricated dwellings oh look theres another one a small one up there lets go and take a look at them
12401,yes all right but er do you mind if i take a look at that rock first its rather unusual
12402,how do you do well i must say this is all most impressive
12403,we come from earth
12404,look we are not mineralogists and even if we were why all the hostility its a respectable profession
12405,look weve as much right to be here as anybody else
12406,havent you got laws to deal with this kind of thing
12407,i see yes well i can sympathize with you gentlemen but i can assure you that im not working for anybody
12408,pure chance my spaceship developed a fault i had to land somewhere
12409,papers no theyre back in my spaceship if youd like to come back there with me
12410,yes go with them its all right jo ill join you in a moment
12411,these are your crop records i take it
12412,its a very poor showing isnt it are you operating above subsistence level
12413,unless im very much mistaken youve got far more to worry about than mineralogists
12414,unless things improve radically youre in grave danger of starving to death
12415,lets see if ive got this right you brought your colonists to this planet just over a year ago
12416,you set up your main dome here with all your subsidiary domes around it
12417,and you were convinced that this planet was suitable for habitation despite the exhaustion of the soil
12418,exactly should have
12419,well in theory you should have a bumper crop by now
12420,no no of course not well in practical terms what you must do is this
12421,didnt you say youd sent some men down there
12422,ill come with you if i may
12423,scientific curiosity my dear chap i find your planet most intriguing
12424,jo dont worry about me ill be careful now go and get some sleep
12425,and what happened
12426,i doubt it come and take a look at these claw marks gentlemen
12427,are you trying to tell me these were made by a giant lizard winton
12428,twenty foot high
12429,then will you kindly tell me how a creature twenty feet high came through that door
12430,ashe is perfectly right there is no reason why this planet should not support a thriving colony
12431,yes yes as a matter of fact i am
12432,because they are being inhibited by some unnatural force we must track it down and overcome it
12433,whatever it was you saw can be destroyed
12434,its all right old chap youre amongst friends now
12435,lizards
12436,i only hope youre right
12437,do they have a language of their own
12438,extraordinary must be some rudimentary telepathic ability are they friendly
12439,ive no idea possibly some evidence to convince your colonists to stay
12440,just play for time
12441,yes oh yes of course
12442,thank you very much you know you really ought to keep this thing of yours under better control
12443,well i only wish i knew something attacked this place late last night
12444,no no it belonged to two colonists
12445,it appears they were wrong doesnt it may i ask what youre doing here
12446,how long have you been here
12447,why presumably youll be moving to another planet
12448,im just making a few tests
12449,im every kind of scientist now if youll excuse me
12450,well id like to but i havent really got the time in any case i ought to get back and tell the colonists that youve arrived
12451,yes well i suppose i could spare you a few moments
12452,what gave you that impression
12453,no i didnt say anything of the sort the two colonists that were living here have been killed
12454,thats right
12455,what are you doing
12456,how far is your ship
12457,the tardis its gone
12458,thank you
12459,yes of course
12460,right
12461,not mister doctor how do you do
12462,im glad you admit it i take it youre preparing to leave at once
12463,oh why
12464,the hostile animals if they exist can be found and destroyed sir
12465,im not a colonist im a visitor
12466,im very much concerned
12467,earth or your corporations profits
12468,what those people need my dear sir are new worlds to live in like this one worlds where they can live like human beings not battery hens
12469,even if it means turning this planet into a slagheap
12470,perhaps your health sir now if youll excuse me ive lost some very valuable equipment perhaps one of your colleagues told you about it a tall blue box
12471,who the blazes are you
12472,well why was this door locked
12473,well where is the man who brought me here and what happened to captain dent
12474,oh i see well i take it that your captain is coming to see ashe
12475,the leader of the colonists
12476,how very formal well shall we go
12477,why
12478,yes thats a point
12479,no
12480,well here are are though i must say i still dont quite understand why you wanted to come here
12481,well youll find some claw marks over there and some more over there
12482,thats right oh yes it was all very efficiently done
12483,well i think the whole thing has been faked by somebody who wanted to frighten the colonists away
12484,yes they could have been faked by some sort of mechanical device
12485,yes yes exactly like this
12486,if you fire that thing youll spoil your whole story monsters dont carry guns you know
12487,yes im fine jo fine sorry if that spoils your plans captain dent
12488,i was to have been another victim of their imaginary monsters theyre trying to frighten you off this planet
12489,yes and one that i shall have great pleasure in bringing before the proper authorities you say theres some sort of procedure
12490,good im sure hell be very interested in hearing what i have to say
12491,oh yes yes the imc people are using a robot to fake these monsters
12492,optical trickery so that you think you can see monsters and a robot with claws so that you can see their effects the immobilized robot is at leesons dome or it was theyve probably removed it by now
12493,yes well dont worry old chap when the adjudicator hears of imcs methods hes bound to decide in your favour
12494,why shouldnt we still be here
12495,well id be only too pleased but at the moment im looking for some lost property its a box a tall blue box like
12496,well no i havent exactly lost it lets say its temporarily mislaid
12497,yes all right come on show me whats wrong
12498,later jo later
12499,eh oh as long as you want it to of course you say that somebody else has been trying to repair this relay circuit
12500,he didnt make a very good job in fact one might almost think that hes been trying to make things worse
12501,what
12502,what about
12503,all right captain dent wheres jo grant
12504,youve got no right to hold her without
12505,i see all right what do you want
12506,thats quite out of the question and i repeat where is jo grant
12507,what
12508,what good will that do dentll deny everything and youll be putting jos life at risk
12509,dents spaceship is only a few hundred yards from this dome hell be monitoring us on his scanners
12510,use your head man if he sees the slightest sign of a search hell detonate that charge
12511,winton wheres jo
12512,what you left her
12513,well how did you get away
12514,youve got to stop him dentll shoot them down and be glad of the excuse
12515,did you say one of them helped you
12516,well where was he
12517,can you direct me there
12518,ive got to talk to him the only way we can save jo now is with help from the inside
12519,i want your help
12520,did you know that captain dent had given orders to have me killed
12521,or that theyve taken jo grant prisoner and may kill her
12522,tomorrow morning the colonists are going to attack your spaceship
12523,i know thats why im here theres something that you can do to help me
12524,release jo grant before the attack starts
12525,you make a frontal attack like that and dentll blast you down without a seconds thought
12526,what difference does that make that ship is like a fortress and the men are trained by the time the adjudicator arrives well he will have killed them all and claimed it was selfdefence
12527,i see well you leave me no alternative if i cant stop you i must help you
12528,by giving you a piece of good advice unless you want imc warned id keep a very close watch of our friend norton
12529,by helping you devise a less idiot plan of attack
12530,excuse me
12531,all right dent wheres jo grant
12532,is this true
12533,ill leave them to you
12534,all i can do is go down to those primitive ruins and start searching from there
12535,good well winton seems to have seized control i only hope he can keep it
12536,weve got to find out whats happening in those primitive ruins and where theyve taken jo
12537,yes and morgan tried to kill another where would the primitives have taken jo to their city
12538,afraid
12539,well did they find them
12540,my dear ashe if the primitives have taken jo to their city i must go after her
12541,what else can i do
12542,what
12543,well i cant just sit here and wait in any case i havent got any food to offer them
12544,but youre running short
12545,thank you
12546,ive come to bring back the girl well ashe will come and give you food if you come and return her look i know you can understand me you can read my mind ive come to buy back the girl
12547,its all right jo its all right im here now
12548,what other one
12549,is it humanoid
12550,thats interesting there must be two races on this planet
12551,dont you worry about that my dear im going to buy you back
12552,thats right just a simple business transaction you know judging by the room and this machinery it could have been a highly advanced civilisation
12553,it went into a decline these primitives could be descendants of a tremendously advanced race
12554,thats extraordinary a sort of chronicle history buildings cities machines they even invented flight
12555,hmm oh buildings in ruins people lying dead some great catastrophe i should think after that everything changes yes look at this jo a completely different style and design much cruder more primitive
12556,it looks like some sort of sacrifice jo there would you say that was some sort of time mechanism
12557,ive no idea but if want to get out of here wed better distract him somehow
12558,jo i dont think he can see us come on
12559,lets not wait to find out
12560,checkmate im afraid miss grant
12561,its like a reactor
12562,i came to take her back
12563,we have no wish to offend your laws the race that built this city were intelligent civilised they wouldnt condemn the innocent
12564,surely the basis of all true law is justice look were both strangers to your planet the girl was brought here by your warriors as a captive all we ask is to be allowed to leave in peace
12565,thank you sir and may i say that im overjoyed to find that justice prevails in your city
12566,yes youre quite right lets get back to the space dome
12567,and why are you impersonating the adjudicator
12568,rubbish
12569,nobody sends me anywhere im a free agent
12570,well my immediate plans are to expose you as an imposter
12571,forged of course
12572,dont be absurd
12573,bureaucratic mumbojumbo
12574,oh is that what you plan to do
12575,winton again
12576,i cant jo he wouldnt understand
12577,yes well the master came to this planet for a purpose jo id like to hear what he has to say when ashe goes to see him
12578,now you stay here ive got to try and stop this senseless killing
12579,and whats that supposed to mean
12580,i agree dont you agree adjudicator
12581,you seem to have achieved a temporary victory young man what do you think is going to happen next
12582,i urge you not to trust this man hes an imposter
12583,i tell you that hes not the adjudicator if he wants to go to the primitive city its for some purpose of his own
12584,why dont you check his credentials with earth
12585,dont be absurd
12586,i repeat do not trust that man
12587,the master has them eating out of his hand
12588,i tried to
12589,no why should they ive got to get some real evidence
12590,in his tardis perhaps
12591,my dear jo a tardis can change its shape you know he changed his to look like the adjudicators spaceship
12592,with this  dont you remember when the master first came to earth i got a hold of the key to his tardis i always thought it might come in useful
12593,yes a slightly more advanced model actually
12594,quite flat wriggle away thats it wriggle away
12595,ah
12596,its a mineralogical survey report about this planet
12597,duralinium theres a lot of other survey reports here too hes visited a lot of planets recently he must be looking for something
12598,ah ha now thats more like it well done jo ill look after these if you dont mind
12599,yes of course i am but id like to find out why the master came to this planet
12600,im coming jo im coming jo youre standing in the alarm beam
12601,gas
12602,what have you done what have you done to her this time
12603,what stopped you
12604,what do you want there
12605,i take it that miss grant is to be held here as a hostage you know you really are most unimaginative
12606,you realise of course it can be extremely dangerous taking you to the primitive city
12607,yeah well you stay there ill go and shift that irrigation pipe
12608,ill remember look out
12609,this is just the beginning
12610,what with this somewhat clapped out and broken isnt it
12611,why not
12612,this is it this is the entrance
12613,i havent the remotest idea
12614,no you cant
12615,no             caldwell
12616,they dont speak theyre telepathic
12617,well it looks like some sort of lumber room take a look at this frieze here i think it might interest you
12618,its a sort of chronicle of their history showing that their science has deteriorated into a somewhat primitive religion
12619,is it well perhaps youd be kind enough to explain it to me
12620,yes i had rather gathered that
12621,you deduced all that from these pictures
12622,oh so thats more like it you mean that you stole the information
12623,tell me why are you so interested in the history of this planet
12624,why not superweapons usually are eventually
12625,i see and so the super race became priests of a lunatic religion worshipping machines instead of gods
12626,well may i remind you that their religion embraces sacrifice and that we are the destined victims
12627,i think youve left it a trifle late
12628,what about me
12629,is it well where is this super weapon of yours
12630,i do know a little basic astronomy
12631,in about ten thousand million years time yes
12632,thats unbelievable
12633,the cloud of cosmic matter that was once a sun of course
12634,so you intend to hold the universe to ransom
12635,no absolute power is evil
12636,no i will not join you in your absurd dreams of a galactic conquest
12637,what for what is the point
12638,youll never understand will you i want to see the universe not rule it
12639,wait and see
12640,the ultimate development of life on this planet
12641,dont listen to him sir
12642,on the contrary hell bring only death and destruction
12643,tell me sir has this weapon of yours ever brought good to your planet
12644,exactly the weapon has only brought death and yet he wants to spread that death throughout the galaxy unless you destroy this weapon sir he will use it for evil
12645,not only does justice prevail on your planet sir but also infinite compassion
12646,thank you sir
12647,jo what are you doing here
12648,weve got to get out of here at once the whole place is going up you have a map give it to me
12649,yes i think this is it come on
12650,look
12651,ashe
12652,and ashe insisted on staying on board yes yes he would of course  colonist
12653,well i cannot tell you how grateful i am
12654,what is it well er its er its a sort of antique really but it does have great sentimental value will you excuse us
12655,as far as hes concerned we havent the tardis returned to earth just a few seconds after it left
12656,dont try and explain jo hed never understand  ltback to the episode listing
12657,so
12658,you know really jo im obviously wasting my time trying to turn you into a scientist
12659,how well i just know thats all everything that happens in life must have a scientific explanation if you know where to look for it that is excuse me
12660,you know jo for a reasonably intelligent young lady you do have the most absurd ideas
12661,bessie how dare you go gallivanting around like that
12662,would you believe magic
12663,hmm
12664,well jo would
12665,well you explain it then
12666,naturally or should i say scientifically solenoids and a solar mechanism in bessie and
12667,would you like me to show you some more then
12668,coming where
12669,oh not you too captain yates
12670,captain yates you astound me
12671,what did you say
12672,devils end devils end
12673,yes yes im fine
12674,lets see what he has to say  fergus
12675,beltane of course  horner
12676,i dont know aquarius the devils hump beltane  hawthorne
12677,devils end of course that woman is perfectly right weve got to stop that lunatic before its too late    fergus
12678,its no good were hopelessly lost
12679,well if we had we would have been there by now you must have missed one
12680,if you look at the map the right way up we might eventually get there now which way is it
12681,thank you very much
12682,thats quite all right we dont want a drink just the directions to the devils hump
12683,yes yes i know but would you please tell us the way this is very urgent
12684,i can assure you sir it will be no such thing
12685,i am no sort of chap sir
12686,wig
12687,look there is no time for all these unnecessary questions
12688,i want to go up to the devils hump because i want to stop that lunatic professor of your from bringing devastation upon you all
12689,is nobody here capable of answering a perfectly simple enquiry whats the matter with you all
12690,fuss ive never heard such balderdash in all
12691,excellent thank you very much
12692,its no good were just wasting time come on if we run well just make it
12693,stop stop that dig stop it
12694,eureka     outside the village a delivery van swerves off the road by the turning to devils end the driver runs covering his ears at the unearthly noise then his van bursts into flames
12695,jo jo please stop fussing
12696,look i tell you i am perfectly all right it was a bit parky up there for a while ill admit but it soon warmed up
12697,yes the final confirmation of my theory
12698,yes i think so
12699,no not just yet i want to wait until im absolutely sure right im going back up to the dig
12700,fortunately no captain yates youd better wait here all right
12701,get him over to that bench quickly
12702,yes its all right i am a doctor
12703,thank you very much and thank you too miss hawthorne
12704,yes of course its a great pity they didnt listen to you in the first place
12705,elementals
12706,you saw the devil
12707,and what did he look like
12708,look miss hawthorne i agreed with you from the first about the danger but now i think youre utterly mistaken whatever else you saw it certainly was not the devil
12709,nonsense jo miss hawthorne who is the leader of this cult
12710,magister yes of course i should have known
12711,jo did you fail latin as well as science magister is the latin word for master
12712,right get the saw will you
12713,poor fellow
12714,well it certainly wasnt the devil at least not exactly
12715,look im going in would you prefer to wait outside
12716,no of course not id be glad of the company come on
12717,if my theorys right were all in mortal danger
12718,everyone in the whole world ah
12719,metal
12720,thats right except that it isnt a model
12721,jo look at the shape of this tomb
12722,a different size thats all now you try picking it up
12723,the reason why you cant pick it up is that is weighs about seven hundred and fifty tons at a rough guess
12724,be serious all right about a hundred thousand years ago
12725,phew
12726,iron its an old magical defence
12727,i dont but he did luckily
12728,no its the first line of an old venusian lullaby as a matter of fact roughly translated it goes close your eyes my darling well three of them at least
12729,i must admit that thing took me completely by surprise
12730,it looked like a gargoyle made of stone
12731,in a sense yes
12732,no the creature she saw must have been a hundred times more hideous
12733,no not your mythical devil jo no but something far more real and far more dangerous
12734,oh thank you miss hawthorne let me help you
12735,youve all been asking me for explanations perhaps these will help me to provide them
12736,nonsense
12737,theres nothing more real than a forcefield sergeant even a psionic one
12738,science
12739,science miss hawthorne
12740,well done jo youre being logical at last ill turn you into a scientist yet right if there are no more interruptions ill tell you what it is
12741,give me that hello lethbridge stewart the doctor here what about going over the top of it
12742,or were locked in all right brigadier well keep in touch
12743,right thats it now as you can see were smack in the middle of a sort of lethal mushroom about ten miles across and a mile high
12744,yes all right jo captain yates would you mind drawing the curtains
12745,top of the class jo top of the class thats right thats the egyptian god khnum with horns theres another one a hindu demon
12746,oh thank you very much and our old friend the horned beast
12747,probably because i havent finished captain yates
12748,ever since man began exactly but why all right captain yates the curtains now creatures like those have been seen over and over again throughout the history of man and man has turned them into myths gods or devils but theyre neither they are in fact creatures from another world
12749,precisely only far far older and immeasurably more dangerous
12750,thats right theyre daemons from the planet daemos which is
12751,and they first came to earth nearly one hundred thousand years ago
12752,thats right mind you when it landed it was two hundred feet long and thirty feet across but they diminished it just as they diminished themselves which accounts for the heat wave and the freezeup
12753,oh come on jo emc squared
12754,look when you lose mass the energy has to go somewhere
12755,exactly
12756,to help homo sapiens kick out neanderthal man theyve been coming and going ever since the greek civilisation the renaissance the industrial revolution they were all inspired by the daemons
12757,look dont you see all the magical traditions are just remnants of their advanced science and that is what the master is using
12758,amoral perhaps they help earth but on their own terms its a scientific experiment to them just another laboratory rat
12759,hes established a link with the daemon what worries me is the choice domination by the master or total annihilation
12760,what does any scientist do with an experiment that fails he chucks it in the rubbish bin
12761,now the daemon will appear three times and the third time hell probably tell us what our fate is to be now hell be in the cavern somewhere awaiting the masters second call
12762,youd be wasting your time sergeant at the moment hes so small hes practically invisible
12763,jo would you get me a piece of paper and a pencil please
12764,what give me that youll do no such thing lethbridge stewart of all the idiotic suggestions in the first place the energy released would only strengthen the barrier in the second place it would provoke the most appalling reprisals and in the third place ive got a better idea over
12765,with the new mark 4a condenser unit
12766,right well tell him to build an ehf wide band width variable phase oscillator with a negative feedback circuit tunable to the frequency of an air molecule at er what is the temperature up at the barrier brigadier
12767,well its a simple enough question over
12768,all right ill come out and explain it to you myself yates and benton can stay here and keep an eye open only dont touch anything until i get there understood    brigadier
12769,jo the brigadier is doing his best to cope with an almost impossible situation and since he is your superior officer you might at least show him a little respect coming
12770,whos flying that thing thats not benton
12771,hang on jo were in for a bumpy ride
12772,like a man possessed you mean look out hes coming back
12773,no you keep away its me hes after not you
12774,hes trying to drive us into the heat barrier
12775,hang tight jo hang on tight now
12776,shes had a nasty knock on the head shell be all right youd better load her into bessie and take her down to the pub shell be needing rest and quiet for a bit
12777,well id better go and have a word with the brigadier hes probably bursting a blood vessel by now
12778,youve got the mind of an accountant lethbridge stewart so this is your heat barrier is it
12779,yes
12780,a hasty and inaccurate assessment brigadier tell me have you got enough cable to reach those high tension pylons over there
12781,well need at least ten thousand volts to get through this lot
12782,good only please hurry we may have very little time left
12783,negative diathermy sergeant buffer the molecular movement of the air with the reverse phase short waves its quite simple
12784,yes well according to classical aerodynamics its impossible for a bumblebee to fly
12785,now get a move on with the heat exchanger weve got to get it charged and through this barrier and down to the village before its too late
12786,no man no youre trying to channel the entire output of the national power complex through one transistor reverse it
12787,reverse the polarity
12788,yes i couldnt agree with you more sergeant now lets concentrate shall we
12789,about next christmas i shouldnt wonder at a rough estimate of course
12790,my dear chap i cant wait to find out
12791,its going i must get back the next time could be the finish sergeant osgood can you operate that machine now
12792,yes well youll have to we may have very little time left
12793,well of course they wont thats the whole point
12794,oh dear oh dear oh dear all right ill explain once again only this time please listen
12795,and it comes out here right
12796,good grief man its as simple as einsteins special theory of relativity
12797,good and when you get that thing finished bring it through the barrier and down to the village at once all right
12798,yes yes most amusing
12799,the masters planning to make slaves of you all im the only one who has a chance of stopping him
12800,thats nonsense all the master will bring upon you is disaster
12801,are you out of your mind
12802,you choose to mock the great qui quae quod well i will not
12803,what had you mind
12804,shatter it yes lamp i order you to shatter
12805,there thatll teach you daughter of light would you kindly untie my bonds
12806,ill give you one more chance look behind you
12807,very well let my familiar spirit bring that car to me
12808,im sorry to disappoint you madame but i were id hardly need your assistance in extricating me from this this sacrificial gift wrapping
12809,elemental my dear benton
12810,where else
12811,wait all of you
12812,well of course im frightened so should you be and your friend mister magister
12813,now were facing the greatest danger the world has ever known now look ive got to tell you the truth
12814,ive got to risk it
12815,im not a magician or a wizard or anything of the sort
12816,but neither is the master ive tricked you yes but only to save you from him
12817,yes of course that too
12818,science not sorcery miss hawthorne look
12819,and your mister magister uses no more magic than that
12820,all his feats are based on science either ours or the secret science of the daemons
12821,well he uses violent emotions fear hatred greed
12822,well the emotions of a group of ordinary human beings generate a tremendous charge of psychokinetic energy this the master channels for his own purpose
12823,no miss hawthorne im afraid not
12824,no no no of course not no they are essential to generate and control the psionic forces and to control the daemon himself
12825,how
12826,yes
12827,exactly all we can do is wait
12828,the energy exchanger this machine that the brigadier is building for me with that i should be able to drain off our visitors energy then perhaps we can sort him out
12829,jo i thought she was still in the pub
12830,what
12831,walkie talkie hello brigadier are you there
12832,look theyve got jo that machine must come through now now do you understand
12833,good and put a watch up on that barrow will you just in case the daemons ship reactivates
12834,come on brigadier get a move on
12835,right now some of you that way but spread out the rest of you follow me
12836,no we must wait for the brigadier
12837,we wont help her by committing suicide
12838,you see whats going on brigadier
12839,what all of you  brigadier
12840,the exchanger is working its bleeding off the energy

12843,hello jo i cannot tell you how glad i am to see you

12845,i came to talk to you
12846,certainly but first let her go
12847,are you all right jo
12848,yes i want you to leave this planet while you still can
12849,why not ive got a machine outside that can annihilate you
12850,youve already felt its power
12851,one of them yes not both
12852,to try and make you listen to me
12853,if you kill me now you will wonder throughout eternity whether you should have listened to my words
12854,i seem to remember somebody else speaking like that what was the bounders name hitler yes thats right adolf hitler or was it genghis khan
12855,im very pleased to hear it
12856,by no means you see i have an alternative
12857,leave humanity alone just go youve done enough harm
12858,you certainly did thanks to you man can now blow up the world and he probably will he can poison the water and the very air he breathes hes already started he can
12859,no no i dont want it
12860,of course i do dont you understand i want you to leave i want you to go away and give man a chance to grow up
12861,run for it brigadier
12862,well by a ridiculous and foolhardy act of selfsacrifice jo here has managed to save us
12863,you did you see azal couldnt face an act as irrational and as illogical as her being prepared to give up her life for me look jo why dont you go and get out of that ridiculous garb
12864,well all his power was turned against himself you might say he blew a fuse
12865,the spaceship automatic selfdestruct i suppose  chalmers
12866,stop firing youll damage bessie
12867,dont worry bessiell bring him back
12868,simple if you know how
12869,and look after him i want to deal with him later
12870,thank you for the compliment
12871,to what
12872,yes well it makes a change from the smell of sulphur doesnt it
12873,youre right jo there is magic in the world after all  ltback to the episode listing
12874,what gave you that idea
12875,my dear jo the tardis was being operated then under remote control by the high council of the time lords
12876,i dont want it to work for them i want it to work for me no ones going to turn me into an interplanetary puppet yes of course why didnt i think of that before©    doctor 2
12877,look jo dont worry about it it was a freak affect its very unlikely to happen again hold that and give me those papers
12878,sorry brigadier im busy
12879,my dear chap im a scientist not a politician
12880,humans are always squabbling over something brigadier
12881,all right brigadier so whats his problem
12882,any idea who
12883,and youre absolutely certain that he used the word ghost
12884,did you also make those marks on the floor over there© muddy feet sir reginald someone was in here you know
12885,oh hes in a bad way poor chap youd better get him to the hospital
12886,sir reginald weve just found a very severely injured man down by the canal tunnel
12887,and carrying that gun
12888,id like to get that gun down to the laboratory and run a few tests on it
12889,well basically its a form of ultrasonic disintegrator
12890,quite an effective little weapon eh
12891,i am
12892,oh my mistake i was forgetting the unimaginative nature of the military mind but we saw a couple of amicas seperatas a few moments ago didnt we jo
12893,mind you they were manifestations of a much more benevolent kind none of your clanking chains and chilly fingers but ghosts none the less
12894,top of the class jo now then pop this in here like that
12895,all right jo all right
12896,well the things completely dead now
12897,yes it started to work oh i see yes yes the temporal feedback circuit has overloaded
12898,please
12899,well
12900,and whoever tried to harm him will probably try again jo how would you like to spend the night in a haunted house
12901,thats common sense you cant expect a ghost to walk in a house full of people can you© come on tuck in
12902,well you ought to eat something you know this is likely to be a very long night
12903,yes yes thats a most good humoured wine a touch sardonic perhaps but not cynical yes a most civilised wine one after my own heart
12904,jo
12905,oh quite right do you know i remember saying to old napoleon boney i said always remember an army marches on its stomach
12906,its just the wind
12907,wake up jo its all right its morning
12908,jo jo
12909,execution
12910,may i ask whose orders
12911,sir reginald is at this moment many thousands of miles away in peking to be precise
12912,no im not he flew there yesterday
12913,its all there in the paper in front of you why dont you take a look
12914,thats right i wanted to talk to you
12915,thats better
12916,youre prejudiced
12917,yes thats not in their favour ill admit you know we shouldnt really judge them until we find out why theyre here well come on jo what about trying out some of that escapology of yours
12918,ill tell you what have a try at untying mine
12919,got them
12920,hes obviously not only important to us hes also important to them or history their history must talk a lot about sir reginald styles i think
12921,well in that case theres only one thing left for us to do
12922,youre learning jo
12923,have you got a better theory
12924,fanatics jo not thugs changing history is a very fanatical idea you know
12925,jo every choice we make changes the history of the world
12926,ah thats the blinovitch limitation effect
12927,did they© oh yes we were probably down the cellar at the time old styles keeps a remarkably good selection of wines you know
12928,look i dont thats very wise brigadier  brigadier
12929,yes well you tell captain yates not to worry everythings fine and tell old styles too and the prime minister  brigadier
12930,well that surprises you© i should have thought with your insight into the future oh no in your case itd be the past wouldnt it
12931,jo put that thing down ive only just got it in working order
12932,jo do as she says
12933,whats happened to her
12934,and if she wasnt
12935,how do you do© hai         brigadier
12936,please wait ive got to talk to you
12937,yes yes so you did
12938,thank you but im probably more familiar with the concept of time travel than you are now wait a minute before the time transference i saw a dalek
12939,look i came here in order to find miss jo grant
12940,but as long as theres a chance
12941,wait a minute what is my best way of finding her
12942,you wouldnt believe me if i told you
12943,am i© who am i spying for
12944,that wasnt a question that was a statement
12945,poor fellows im sorry i cant oblige them at the moment im not in the mood for games
12946,ive already told you what im doing here im looking for a girl called jo grant
12947,then im glad you finally succeeded
12948,you surprise me
12949,frankly i dont know whether i can stand much more of your hospitality
12950,miss grant
12951,is she safe
12952,it was two hundred years to be precise and quite frankly i wish i was back there now
12953,oh ive known many times and some of them much more pleasant than others
12954,well i met some people today who were far from kind
12955,well better than jumping from the crack of a whip from some security guard do you run all your factories like that controller
12956,oh© then what was it
12957,including old men and women even children
12958,now thats an old fashioned point of view even from my standards
12959,then why do you need so many people to keep them under control© dont they like being happy and prosperous
12960,am i now
12961,does he© i wonder why
12962,when i meet a regime that needs to import savage alien life forms as security guards i begin to wonder who the real criminals are
12963,you mean there arent enough humans around that will follow your orders so blindly
12964,isnt it© then what youre saying is that the entire human population of this planet apart from a few remarkable exceptions like yourself are really only fit to lead the life of a dog why
12965,havent i© who really rules this planet of yours
12966,neither do you jo neither do you that man is no more than a superior slave himself humans dont rule this world any longer jo
12967,right now do you understand exactly what to do
12968,good
12969,pity that was rather a good vintage
12970,you wont succeed you know
12971,my dear man how can i tell you what i dont know myself
12972,yes for your own purposes
12973,i dont doubt it
12974,as you cooperate with them© do you really think that makes any difference
12975,reasonable© they tolerate you as long as youre useful to them
12976,you sir you sir are a traitor youre a quisling
12977,so theyve turned the earth into a giant factory with all the wealth and minerals were looted and taken to skaro
12978,a family of quislings eh
12979,wouldnt you have helped more by organising the fight against them
12980,thats not what your criminal guerillas seem to think is it
12981,for the last time i tell you i havent got any information and quite frankly even if i had i wouldnt give it to you
12982,put that gun down theres no point in murdering him
12983,nevertheless hes not your real enemy
12984,they would always have found someone now just leave him
12985,this history of yours it talks about sir reginald styles
12986,so the conference he called was just a trick
12987,so you went back into our time to kill styles before he could carry out his plan
12988,well that must have been the man that we saw down by the canal tunnel you remember jo the one who vanished from the ambulance
12989,yes well theres one thing i dont quite understand and that is why were you so keen to rescue us© well believe me were grateful but
12990,yes
12991,what do you expect me to do
12992,youre asking me to commit murder
12993,that is still murder
12994,but your history could be wrong you know© now listen why dont you send us back to our time© we know the future now maybe there are other things we can do
12995,yes i agree jo vain to the point of arrogance a trifle obstinate perhaps but basically a good man so if it happened how did it happen© any of your people still in our time zone
12996,look please believe me im completely with you about the ends i only disagree as to the means
12997,any sabotage equipment
12998,dalekanium
12999,could it destroy a house
13000,isnt that exactly what he would have done© one last suicidal attempt to carry out his orders
13001,youre trapped in a temporal paradox styles didnt cause that explosion and start the wars you did it yourselves
13002,good
13003,oh yes it can and i can do it are you going to stop me
13004,you spoke of the war of its years of suffering and starvation well i can prevent all that happening you know
13005,thank you jo come here and stand by me
13006,brigadier brigadier get everybody out of this house at once
13007,look try and use your intelligence man even if you are a politician
13008,brigadier get this man and all the delegates out of this area immediately use force if you have to jo you stay here
13009,shura listen to me styles and all the delegates are already leaving this house you detonate that bomb and youll be sacrificing yourself for nothing
13010,no shes not theyve come back to make sure that their version of history isnt changed is everybody out of the house
13011,couldnt we set a time fuse
13012,very well
13013,tell your men to fall back let the daleks into the house
13014,it may not make military sense but its the only way
13015,so do we weve seen it happen havent we jo©  ltback to the episode listing
13016,there you are jo a perfect landing
13017,now now miss grant lets not be impatient
13018,its hardly a joyride jo this is the tardis first test flight since i got it working again
13019,one minute jo routine landing procedures first eh© lets see what the scanners have to tell us
13020,must be on the blink
13021,i hope youre as in good condition when youre as old as she is
13022,right jump
13023,jo the tardis may have its faults but it is indestructible our main worry is how to get to it we certainly cant climb down there jo jo look up there
13024,well we certainly cant recover the tardis by ourselves wed better get up there and see if we can find help
13025,well you could always wait here i suppose
13026,exactly so the sooner we find out the better come on
13027,well we certainly cant stay here jo ill tell you what lets traverse along this ledge for a bit ill see if theres another way out have a look that way
13028,yes what is it© jo© jo where are you© jo where are you
13029,what is it
13030,jo come at look at this
13031,no neither have i at least not on earth come on
13032,which way indeed© eenie meenie mynie mo
13033,yes if the tunnels never used why is this torch still alight
13034,late© er yes my apologies to the committee but er our space shuttle crashlanded down the mountain i wonder if something could be done about rescuing it
13035,how do you do
13036,im afraid that will not be possible we have lost everything in the crash
13037,yes of course will you excuse me
13038,yes in a democratic sort of way
13039,no no of course not
13040,yes thank you for reminding me
13041,threatened© perhaps youd be kind enough to explain that to me from the beginning©      peladon
13042,do my ears deceive me© members of the galactic federation squabbling like a gang of small children
13043,that is a splendid idea
13044,look out
13045,im sorry to have been so abrupt about it gentlemen
13046,i think we should investigate what caused this hepesh
13047,if only as a matter of protocol
13048,it must have been a pretty substantial type of ghost to have shifted a solid granite statue
13049,well the point is what does king peladon believe
13050,your majesty is an enlightened ruler but who will your people believe© king peladon or aggedor
13051,his majesty deserves the opportunity to convince us surely
13052,you dont think that king peladon would keep you here by force do you
13053,your majesty we will adjourn now and consider our position we will let you know our decision as soon as possible
13054,do they well believe me i know the ice warriors jo theyre a savage and a warlike race no among the delegates only ssorgs strength could have shifted that statue
13055,well who else could be responsible© arcturus is only a box of tricks and i hardly think centauri would hurt a fly would you
13056,the point is what possible motive could they have
13057,well how do you like being a princess princess
13058,obviously so
13059,youll do no such thing jo its far too dangerous im going to try a little direct confrontation here
13060,jo please do as i say theres a good girl
13061,i think that should do it
13062,this is the work of a skilled technical knowledge your medieval monster hepesh would simply have tried to smash arcturus protective globe
13063,yes of course you would but nevertheless you cant deny that you do have the necessary technical knowledge
13064,how very fortunate izlyr excuse me gentlemen
13065,in here© why© is someone in trouble© well who grun© not the princess© all right all right
13066,give me a chance to explain hepesh
13067,no hepesh give me a chance
13068,i had no idea that the tunnels would lead there
13069,king peladon i swear to you that i am telling the truth i am innocent
13070,yes youre a wily old bird arent old you hepesh© but you do realise dont you that my death would cause a major interplanetary scandal© consider the consequences hepesh
13071,i see killed while trying to escape is that it
13072,im afraid i cant well not without my space shuttle
13073,yes thats it where is it now
13074,well thats splendid and what about princess josephine
13075,hepesh why do you go to so much trouble© you could simply have me killed
13076,yet you slap the federation in the face by sabotaging the commission why
13077,afraid© afraid of what© the federation is your safeguard
13078,the federations real intent is to help you
13079,the progress that they offer that we offer isnt like that
13080,free© with your people imprisoned by ritual and superstition
13081,you can hardly expect your pet ghost to take on the whole federation singlehanded can you
13082,oh© who stands with you
13083,yes i rather hoped id meet up with you old chap
13084,klokleda partha mennin kletch haroon haroon haroon klokleda sheena tirra nach haroon haroon haroon
13085,no jo keep back
13086,jo keep back
13087,jo
13088,yes yes of course you did and very brave you were too come on lets see if we can find king peladon
13089,im sorry to disappoint you hepesh
13090,your majesty i bring you a message from aggedor
13091,well we just did and i must say hes quite pleasant company for an animal he didnt even seem to mind when i scratched him behind the ears
13092,rubbish his manifestation as you call it is solid hairy fact
13093,he lives in the tunnels beneath the city sire
13094,the entrance is hidden your majesty
13095,once i have proved what aggedor really is the trial by combat sir will hardly become necessary
13096,all right live grun i would not kill the kings champion
13097,thats why he wanted to make sure that peladon did not enter the galactic federation you see hed already made a private secret alliance with hepesh
13098,ah but is it
13099,but hepesh is still very much alive
13100,exactly and then all the rest of the galactic federation would take sides and
13101,and peladon would become the first battlefield blasted and sterile
13102,its not easy to be a king peladon but unless you replace hepesh he will destroy everything that you have worked for
13103,then i think we ought to try and persuade you your majesty will you excuse us© we have the need of a private conference for the benefit of alpha centauri
13104,jo do you realise how dangerous and complex this situation has become© hepesh could still bring peladon to his way of thinking and if that happens hell have won without a fight
13105,jo you seem to be forgetting something else officially we dont even exist were just a couple of imposters
13106,yeah so thats why grun was beckoning at me like that
13107,grun grun what happened© who attacked you© who
13108,perhaps we do come on youre not frightened are you a big chap like you© well dont be you come with me come on
13109,grun youre a brave warrior what youre going to see now may amaze you but just you trust me
13110,haroon haroon haroon haroon harun haroon haroon harun haroon haroon harun haroon haroon harun haroon there you are grun yes hes quite under now not such a terrifying creature after all is he© right i think its about time that king peladon learned the truth dont you© come on aggedor come on old chap thats it come on aggedor thats it come on grun
13111,who dares challenge peladon
13112,kneel and pay homage to his sacred guardian
13113,and i speak for aggedor and i accuse you hepesh of being not only a traitor to your king but also to your sacred trust
13114,back back thats it back back
13115,tell your men to lay down their arms your leader is dead
13116,come on jo follow me ive got a nice surprise for you
13117,all right then
13118,some of peladons stout lads heaved here up the mountainside for us
13119,so do i jo so do i
13120,yes i think so
13121,no not yet but i will jo just give me time still now weve done what they wanted us to do i suppose theyll whip us straight back to earth
13122,dont worry its only aggedor
13123,the trouble is he seems to have grown rather fond of me he keeps following me about hello aggedor
13124,theres a good chap all right down aggedor down boy down i think id better go and lock him up
13125,come on come on aggedor
13126,your majesty oh excuse me sire but your court officials are in a state of considerable panic
13127,right well just see the ceremony and slip quietly away all right
13128,jo© you do want to come back
13129,pity about that i rather wanted to see that coronation
13130,queen victorias© ive already seen queen victorias
13131,all right  alpha
13132,there you are jo thats the masters permanent residence from now on
13133,okay
13134,right         trenchard
13135,well i suppose we could always come back later
13136,yes thank you
13137,what does
13138,it does indeed
13139,well look weve been through all that actually
13140,thats right yes
13141,that was the general idea
13142,if ever i get the opportunity has he given you any trouble as yet
13143,has he tried to hypnotise any of the guards by any chance
13144,my word hes putting on weight
13145,yes very impressive perhaps we could see him now yes
13146,yes well how are you
13147,thank you colonel
13148,very small colony wasnt it in fact i believe they claimed independence soon after he arrived
13149,you can consider yourself lucky quite a few people were in favour of having you executed
13150,have you now
13151,am i to take it that youre a changed man
13152,in that case perhaps youd like to tell me the whereabouts of your tardis
13153,no so that i can make absolutely certain that you cant
13154,ask a silly question come on jo i think wed better be going is there anything that i can do for you at all
13155,goodbye
13156,well he used to be a friend of mine once a very good friend in fact you might almost say we were at school together
13157,forever i should think
13158,what again
13159,no indeed but i advise you to be careful hes a very dangerous man
13160,thank you
13161,well whos trying to hush it up
13162,you seem to know a great deal about all this
13163,well wheres this boat now
13164,well wheres this naval base then
13165,right well perhaps youd like to take me there straight away
13166,yes well youre probably perfectly right look er i wonder whether youd like to go and see whats happening to my young friend she said she was going to buy some picture postcards
13167,id go myself only my bad legs playing me up a bit the crimea you know
13168,oh gallipoli el alamein does it really matter
13169,good afternoon i wonder whether i could see your commanding officer
13170,i never carry the things a lot of bureaucratic nonsense if you wish to see my pass then ask miss grant
13171,well i just dropped in purely on impulse old chap as soon as i heard about that charred lifeboat i had to see it
13172,youve inspected the boat yourself
13173,then you must have noticed the linear nature of those scorch marks excuse me my dear may i
13174,yes but it didnt catch fire if it had the smoke and flames would have been seen wouldnt they
13175,a concentrated beam of heat applied from underneath the boat whilst it was still in the water
13176,yes to make sure there were no survivors what are these markers here
13177,go my dear chap i dont want to go i want to visit this fort here
13178,nevertheless it is right in the centre of all the trouble isnt it now if some of your naval bods could get me out there captain
13179,look dont you realise how important this is
13180,if horatio nelson had been in charge of this operation i hardly think that he would have waited for official instructions
13181,history books captain hart horatio nelson was a personal friend of mine come on jo
13182,up that ladder now hold tight jo were coming alongside now
13183,we will jo we will and well take his motor bicycle back at the same time still now were here lets take a look around shall we

13193,yes
13194,now easy
13195,yeah come on dont worry get yourself down here
13196,wheres your radio the radio where is it
13197,yes they certainly did
13198,now listen to me take this swab jo swab his arm now are there are more transmitters on this fort
13199,any transistor radios that sort of thing
13200,it is possible to turn a receiver into a transmitter you know
13201,yes its simply a matter of modulating the signal you connect the output of your loudspeaker into the input of your low frequency amplifier then you connect the output of your low frequency amplifier into your oscillator you use your loudspeaker as a microphone and there you are
13202,now where exactly are these transistor radios
13203,all right thank you now dont worry this is not going to hurt you all right now youll soon be all right
13204,soon feel better look after him will you jo
13205,dont be alarmed ive no wish to harm you
13206,wire
13207,just as i thought reptiles like those creatures in the caves its completely hostile here hang on to this tight hang on
13208,those creatures can cut through anything rock metal anything
13209,come on give me a hand
13210,weve got to get after that creature now come on
13211,nearly finished just about to test it
13212,certainly i do ill prove it to you right here goes  d j
13213,i think i must have got me wires crossed somewhere
13214,thanks
13215,mmm
13216,something very similar certainly they emerged from some caves in derbyshire
13217,thats a complete misnomer the chap who discovered them must have got the period wrong no properly speaking they should have been called the eocenes
13218,thats right and if you want my opinion theres another of their colony right here beneath us
13219,probably the rebuilding of this fort
13220,well this is a different species completely adapted to life underwater
13221,very likely
13222,they still think of earth as their planet jo and they want it back as far as theyre concerned man is just an ape who got above himself right i think that should do it lets have another go hello hello mayday mayday mayday this is er this er this is what is this whats our call sign
13223,hello mayday mayday mayday this is oscar bravo tango seven four we are stranded on this fort and have a wounded man here can you send immediate assistance can you hear me can you hear me over
13224,hello oscar bravo tango speaking who are you who are you over
13225,yes well though i say so myself i think thats a remarkably efficient piece of work         trenchard
13226,even you must admit that something happened on that fort
13227,well to begin with we must make every effort to make contact with them
13228,it may still be possible to find a peaceful solution were not dealing with animals captain hart were dealing with intelligent beings
13229,colonel trenchard
13230,yes why dont you do that colonel captain hart is likely to be very busy from now on
13231,it entirely depends how long it takes me to conclude my business good day colonel
13232,where were we indeed ships must be kept away from this area
13233,youll have even bigger protests if ships go on sinking
13234,youll just have to patrol the area wont you
13235,you dont seem to realise how dangerous
13236,what
13237,jo please not now
13238,what where
13239,captain hart i suggest that you order a full security alert immediately
13240,miss grant has just seen a very dangerous criminal on your base
13241,come on
13242,what did this officer look like
13243,trenchard
13244,well dont you see he arrived just before this happened and he left a few moments ago
13245,yes i certainly am captain hart can you lend me some transport
13246,no time to explain now come on jo
13247,colonel trenchard
13248,ive reason to believe that your prisoner has escaped
13249,it is
13250,yes you do that
13251,try and get an outside line no theyre both completely dead now listen jo i want you to take the jeep go down to the naval base and call unit tell them that colonel trenchard and his entire staff are to replaced immediately
13252,no buts jo just do as i ask
13253,now dont worry about me ill stay here and keep an eye on him now you hurry
13254,fore
13255,you were saying colonel
13256,oh shes gone back to the naval base
13257,oh ive just seen him
13258,yes on there
13259,if you insist
13260,been out for a little jaunt have you
13261,why did you go to the naval stores and steal those electronic spares
13262,youve got some sort of hold over colonel trenchard whats going on
13263,good afternoon
13264,oh you think so
13265,ah but you havent seen the quality of my footwork yet
13266,only a complete fool would listen to such an accusation though i suppose in your case
13267,oh dont be absurd man
13268,if you must continue with this ridiculous charade only take care not to lose him this time wont you
13269,have you any idea why colonel trenchard is taking orders from the master look man im talking to you
13270,is that what the master told you to say
13271,ive done no such thing the master knocked that guard out himself as you very well know
13272,thats absolute rubbish anybody at unit headquarters will vouch for me if youll permit me to use the telephone
13273,colonel trenchard why are you allowing the master to use you like this
13274,look youre jeopardising your entire career
13275,didnt anybody else warn you about the master whatever hes told you its all lies
13276,you really think you can keep me here
13277,i see thank you thank you very much
13278,i hadnt really anything better to do
13279,thank you
13280,how very kind of you
13281,im very relieved to hear it
13282,your usual childish desire to gloat perhaps
13283,everything i sent them a full report as soon as miss grant spotted you at the naval base
13284,well youll find out soon enough
13285,and how would you explain that away to colonel trenchard im hardly in a position to attack you now am i
13286,whatever youre up to you still need trenchards cooperation youre still a prisoner here you know
13287,then why dont you
13288,how do you know about them
13289,more stolen information
13290,well why do you want to contact them
13291,i still dont see why you want to help them what can you possibly gain
13292,better run along old chap youre still a prisoner here you know
13293,anyone out there
13294,how much longer am i going to be kept chained up like this       doctor
13295,youll find tools over there
13296,behind the door
13297,these handcuffs theyre far too tight theyre killing me
13298,after you
13299,no no after you
13300,come on jo come on
13301,theres only one thing for it well have to go through the minefield
13302,no dont worry
13303,my sonic screwdriver it converts into rather a good mine detector
13304,relax jo relax
13305,hold still hold still
13306,well i can assure you we didnt walk ten miles across open countryside just to tell you fairy stories
13307,i doubt it the masters got some sort of hold over him
13308,all right jo all right all right let me deal with the explanations look its like this
13309,for heavens sakes jo what do you think this is a picnic
13310,all right what about the theft of your electronic spares surely youll agree that happened
13311,well hes developed some way of communicating with them probably a ultrahigh frequency sonic beam these are rather good want one
13312,sandwich
13313,oh im so sorry
13314,how overdue is the submarine
13315,it should never have been sent you know they were bound to presume it was hostile
13316,captain hart you are dealing with a situation completely outside of your own experience and if you wont let me help you
13317,well the key to this whole situation is at the castle
13318,you see where the things heading that beach by castle perhaps youll believe me now
13319,perhaps they cant
13320,captain hart weve got to find out whats happening at that castle
13321,the master had no further use for him thats why
13322,what would you say was trenchards strongest characteristic
13323,exactly and the master used that patriotism as a weapon
13324,the submarine
13325,the fort look captain hart can you lay on a diving vessel
13326,i want to inspect the sea bed at the base of that fort
13327,yes positive
13328,if you dont mind id rather go down on my own
13329,naturally whats more i know these creatures ive encountered them before so i know what im looking for
13330,what is it jo
13331,how else am i going to make contact
13332,thank you captain hart     cp
13333,yes thank you chief  cp
13334,hang on a minute
13335,your people went into hibernation and abandoned earth to its fate
13336,yes but the catastrophe that you predicted never happened and the apes that you left behind on the surface to die became man
13337,yes yes ive encountered your people before that is why i want to prevent a conflict that can only end in your destruction
13338,yes and already more ships are being sent to hunt you down
13339,you may win a few victories to begin with but eventually youre bound to lose
13340,but theres no need for a war why cant you share the planet
13341,the depths of the sea and those areas on earth where man cannot live can be yours
13342,theres a chance wouldnt it be better to try for a peace than to launch yourself into a war that you cannot possibly win
13343,let me return to the humans and i will endeavour to make a peace for you
13344,i beg you not to listen to this man hes the personification of evil
13345,he wants only to provoke a war
13346,why should you need his help
13347,but why revive your people only to have them killed let me try and negotiate that peace for you
13348,yes i tried to make peace but i failed
13349,believe me man is not weak hes only too proficient at devising weapons of annihilation and using them
13350,if youll release the submarine and its crew yes as a gesture of good faith
13351,good afternoon gentlemen er look would you mind keeping back for a moment that is if you want to get out thank you
13352,look ive no time to explain now where are the rest of your men
13353,is the submarine still operational
13354,wheres the sub now
13355,can you find the way
13356,right youd better lead on here take this its a gun now come on lets hurry
13357,no no dont kill him
13358,theyre holding us back with some kind of force field
13359,well you could try firing your torpedoes at the cave wall and blasting yourselves free
13360,thats a risk youll have to take
13361,well hurry up and fire those torpedoes or well be drawn back into the cave  rating
13362,dead no i dont think so
13363,captain hart what idiot ordered an all out attack just as i was on the verge of finding a peaceful solution
13364,you ordered the attack
13365,did you give any thought at all sir as to what you were doing
13366,that sir is an extremely insular point of view at the precise moment of the attack i was negotiating a peace
13367,but the point mister parliamentary private secretary is that you have not destroyed you have just made them angry very very angry
13368,but that sir would be tantamount to murder
13369,you can share it with them surely
13370,look let me make one final attempt to negotiate
13371,just you think of it sir think of it wouldnt you like to be the man behind a peaceful settlement walker the peacemaker theyd call you or would you prefer to be known as the man responsible for launching a full scale war
13372,yes
13373,just leave it to me
13374,jo its the only way
13375,dont you understand jo ive got to go down there of my own free will as a gesture of good faith captain hart is that diving vessel still alongside
13376,then with your permission mister walker  my cape
13377,im doing the only thing possible captain hart if were to avoid a major conflict
13378,all right captain hart get these two out of here
13379,you havent reactivated them yet have you
13380,i wondered why i was still alive
13381,and how do you hope to do that
13382,and youve convinced your reptilian friends that this will work
13383,hmm yes i suppose its possible
13384,good grief what on earth do you think youre doing
13385,well this circuit here its completely misplaced and also youll need far more power through to your main dipode give me a pencil will you
13386,thank you
13387,yes i think so given time now then lets see
13388,oh i need a polarising condenser
13389,oh thank you
13390,now jo listen to me in a few minutes time im going to create a diversion now as soon as it starts you try and get hart and the others out
13391,dont worry about the guards you leave them to me now you hurry back there and wait for the off
13392,all right
13393,how about a little test right here goes  the doctor switches it on and the reptile clutches its head in agony
13394,i must have had the frequency too high im sorry about that oh no i see what it is i had the output jack in the input socket there yeah there that should work all right now
13395,we
13396,oh i see
13397,if you insist
13398,well it seems as if things arent quite going according to plan
13399,look out behind you
13400,yes i am this man is an extremely dangerous criminal so guard him well now have you seen captain hart and miss grant
13401,right id better go and find them
13402,yeah do that and watch him
13403,have you seen jo grant anywhere
13404,dont listen to him why begin a long and bloody war where thousands will be killed on both sides
13405,is there nothing i can say to make you reconsider
13406,im sorry
13407,the power may take some time to build up you know
13408,you seem to be losing your touch
13409,i very much doubt it you see before you reactivated it i reversed the polarity of the neutron flow
13410,oh yes do you
13411,exactly in about ten minutes from now the whole place should go up enjoy your revenge
13412,youre wasting your time you know even if they heard you they couldnt do anything about it
13413,well i built a selfdestruct mechanism into the main control switch you cant turn it off
13414,thats right unless we can both escape
13415,you see come on
13416,yes there must be one around here somewhere otherwise how else did we get down in those capsules here you are put this on
13417,its the master he collapsed soon after they picked us up
13418,i managed to destroy their base for you
13419,well i did what i had to to prevent a war
13420,doctor what doctor
13421,mmm
13422,no nearly finished jo
13423,im making a minimum inertia superdrive for bessie
13424,eh
13425,no
13426,no nothing so exciting
13427,its an assignment
13428,no its a container of some kind jo from them
13429,thats right
13430,im not allowed to open it
13431,i couldnt even if i wanted to no im not meant to i couldnt open it even if i wanted to no its only meant for one person and or creature it will only open for one person
13432,yeah thats right yes im just the messenger boy
13433,they only send these things in a real emergency jo its top priority a three line whip no ive got to go
13434,i think that has already been decided
13435,thats out of the question its bound to be dangerous probably difficult
13436,sorry jo a lot of rubbish not this time au revoir
13437,it looks like the tradesmans entrance doesnt it
13438,i dont see any red carpet do you
13439,were not exactly flying jo were in planetary orbit we must be on a    man
13440,we are expected then  man
13441,well put less delicately jo delousing
13442,taking their time arent they jo jo jo where oh they you are
13443,mmm
13444,dont use expressions like that jo please
13445,according to the tardiss instrument readings we are now in the thirtieth century empire
13446,your empire earths empire yes great colonists earthmen you know jo once theyd sacked the solar system they moved onto pastures new solos is one of them one of the last did you ever read gibbons decline and fall
13447,jo this is like that you see
13448,oh well empires rise and empires fall and if this is their idea of a reception this one has obviously crumbled
13449,what
13450,oh yes of course
13451,its all right theres nobody about come on    man
13452,yes i know im not sure i like being described as a malfunction
13453,well we cant wander around here all night with nobody noticing now can we
13454,i cant hold it much longer
13455,ive no idea but whatever it is it isnt friendly
13456,look you fool
13457,look at his hand
13458,i assume i have no choice
13459,mutant native you said
13460,what
13461,oh yes so you can
13462,well the earth these people know now jo in the thirtieth century empire is even more grey and misty
13463,land and sea alike all grey grey cities linked by grey highways across grey deserts
13464,oh yeah slag ash clinker the fruits of technology jo
13465,good morning
13466,we come from earth
13467,overlord centre
13468,yes
13469,well they certainly had when we left
13470,sometime ago now
13471,look this was an emergency
13472,for goodness sake does it matter how we got here
13473,this is why jo
13474,well its a container of some kind but i must have confess that
13475,i cant
13476,youre wasting your time marshal this box will only open for the person to whom it was sent
13477,you see
13478,oh dont be a fool if we were saboteurs thatd be a bomb and thanks to you wed all be blown to smithereens by now
13479,if you really want to find out whats in this box
13480,may i suggest that you take it to the conference it could well be for someone there
13481,bombastic signature tune isnt it
13482,does it really  man
13483,yes quite so
13484,sorry about that stubbs well done jo you did that beautifully
13485,do you think so
13486,come on lets get to that conference
13487,well to the conference of course
13488,pass what pass
13489,look all this has been arranged by the administrator
13490,look this thing contains important documents details of the whole independence agreement ready for signing
13491,what
13492,the box its opening wait this is for you
13493,wait
13494,no you cant
13495,ah
13496,would you kindly explain that remark sir
13497,how poisonous
13498,may i suggest that you do so immediately
13499,and let her die you cant do that
13500,how very convenient for you now look are you going to search for miss grant or not
13501,does it
13502,apparently
13503,no im sorry that would be completely unethical
13504,all right ill try and open the box for you but i shall need your most advanced laboratory facilities
13505,marshal
13506,thats better
13507,adequate not quite what i hoped for but adequate
13508,well i was rather hoping for a particle reversal setup you know something that would turn the box inside out but all this stuff it seems for geared for atmosphere modulation
13509,yes im terribly sorry im afraid that was me id no idea that the thing was operational one of your circuits was about to overload
13510,you know i cant think why you people ever came here
13511,are the deposits now exhausted
13512,so now you plan to colonise the planet in earnest if you can change the atmosphere
13513,well there are other people concerned you know
13514,well the solonians for example after all it is their planet
13515,i think youll find that
13516,on the contrary my dear chap i find it a very useful research technique
13517,i expect the particles to reverse and for the box to turn itself inside out whats on the outside will be on the inside and whats on the inside will be on the outside where we can see it
13518,you think so come over here and see for yourself
13519,there are bound to be one or two snags to begin with
13520,well of course it worked
13521,i dont suppose you saw what it was did you inside i mean
13522,was all over in a flash yes i know
13523,who
13524,another mutant
13525,and now you say hes mutating  guard
13526,marshal
13527,i wonder could i perhaps go on this mutt hunt with you
13528,get it over with you dont intend shooting him in cold blood do you
13529,how do you know
13530,varan no varan varan wait
13531,i think youd better tell us what you know quickly were your only chance
13532,thats right you heard varans story
13533,yes exactly but now the planets under marshal law his nibs as you call him means to keep it that way
13534,keep varan in hiding tell the marshal hes been dealt with i cant move against him openly until i am sure miss grant is safe ill just have to play for time
13535,dealt with
13536,youve found her then when can i see her
13537,a day or so
13538,what about ky
13539,until you let me see miss grant you mean
13540,what youre proposing and do correct me if i am wrong is an all out rocket attack on a defenceless planet
13541,try telling the solonians that
13542,even if it means wiping out every solonian in the process
13543,genocide is a sideeffect you ought to write a paper on that professor
13544,yes perhaps
13545,particle reversal is one way not as violent as yours of course but the result will be the same
13546,well we could try an experiment couldnt we
13547,hmm
13548,oh yes
13549,when can i see her cotton
13550,what
13551,that means ive got to find both of them how am i going to do that
13552,is there any other way to the transfer station
13553,cotton is there an emergency power supply to the transfer station
13554,what would happen if i blew the main power supply to the whole of skybase
13555,yes exactly but if the emergency power supply to the transfer station were already switched over
13556,yes exactly can you get the power switched over
13557,good now ill tell you what i want you to do
13558,professor ive been thinking perhaps we could try an experiment just to prove whether im right or wrong about particle reversal
13559,but well need to link up to the main power supply
13560,oh no not a bit of it old chap that modulators utterly reliable but id be very grateful if youd keep a close eye on it would you well are you ready
13561,here goes
13562,you will take me to ky or i will leave you here for the guards to find now do you give me your word as a warrior
13563,firestorms is that all
13564,its a simple atmospheric disturbance varan and something very much to our advantage
13565,did i say i was an earthman
13566,well somebodys been here i wonder why they left
13567,perhaps but i hope the answer to their mutation is in here  come on lets find ky
13568,somethings going on in there perhaps its miss grant
13569,what is it varan the great warrior afraid of the dark
13570,im delighted to hear it come on then
13571,leave him alone go on back get back get back leave him be
13572,steady old chap he did help to save your life you know
13573,thats right now where is she
13574,good
13575,to find her
13576,perhaps these tablets are worth more to you than any weapons
13577,well read it man well what does it say read it
13578,but youve seen this kind of writing before
13579,yes but they must mean something otherwise why would i have been sent here
13580,no im sorry i cant go yet
13581,i cant go yet not without miss grant
13582,now varan wait varan wait
13583,no right ky take me to miss grant
13584,there must be somebody on solos who understands the old language
13585,and
13586,our friend the marshal again
13587,well
13588,perhaps wed better start searching hadnt we
13589,no
13590,well well just have to search them all over again wont we
13591,what you heard them
13592,yes they dont attack us in the tunnels only in here this chamber must be important to them
13593,feel what
13594,yes yes its strange lets keep searching come on
13595,all right quick back to the chamber
13596,shush wait listen
13597,yes its all right its me
13598,no ky    stubbs
13599,yes
13600,mmm hmm
13601,a mutant
13602,well and then what
13603,well whatever it was it brought you back here
13604,here just a minute i dont particularly want to find myself in the marshals hands again thank you very much
13605,attack
13606,let me see those tablets again ky the answer must be here somewhere
13607,whatever it is i think wed better follow it come on
13608,lead what does lead mean to you jo
13609,yes exactly       sondergaard
13610,this er increase in aggression that you speak of it seems to be spreading
13611,ky this is not a political meeting were all on your side you know all of us
13612,look give him a chance to explain
13613,but you have continued with your research
13614,and now
13615,professor jaegers experiments
13616,yes yes indeed but why was i sent here where do these tablets come in ky
13617,yes but what do they mean
13618,yes i can see that professor but can you read them
13619,and ended if we dont get a move on i think
13620,professor professor is there another way out
13621,no sorry stubbs no you go take miss grant with you the professor and i have got work to do
13622,jo look the key to everything lies here in this room these tablets professor sondergaards records i must find the answer
13623,we shall have time
13624,jo please please dont argue with me ill join you later
13625,yes well they arent numbers so it cant be a code lets try something else fire earth air water no all right thats no good
13626,yes but the process keeps repeating itself what process repeats itself
13627,life in some form will always go on
13628,yes
13629,it must be a code of some kind it must eureka its a calendar spring summer autumn winter
13630,well it may not tilt professor but it could move closer look these ellipses here theyre the orbits
13631,then the seasons must be five hundred years long
13632,see these signs here they only appear in the summer and these little matchstick men here only appear in the spring
13633,yes like small sun symbols well yes but thats it that thats what i said thats radiation thats thaesium radiation so thats why they sent me here professor i want you to take me to that place where you found jo grant
13634,any man perhaps
13635,right there it is how do we move it
13636,this way right
13637,your helmet professor your helmet man
13638,dont worry about me ive already prepared myself ready come on
13639,come on weve got to get to the heart of it
13640,yes of course the solonians are meant to mutate the mutation is part of it a part of an evolution theyre meant to change as their environment changes every five hundred years a life cycle unique in the history of the universe and now thanks to the marshal threatened with extinction
13641,no its a metamorphosis an adaptive change the mutants as we know them are an intermediate form
13642,exactly the radiation cave is the key to that
13643,yes it must play a vital part in the process but what
13644,thats the extraordinary thing about it it shows absolutely no radioactivity at all here try it for yourself
13645,apparently not if only we could analyse it and find out its true function
13646,skybase jaegers lab     man
13647,its rockets that fool jaegers bombarding the planet with rockets it seems to have died down for the moment lets get out of here and find miss grant and the others     man
13648,no theres no sign of them
13649,no well he said he was going to attack skybase if he ran into any of the others come on lets make for the transfer station
13650,its started already contamination from the ionisation crystals weve got to get out of here sondergaard
13651,my dear chap i wouldnt hear of it
13652,yes all right you take care all right
13653,goodbye
13654,cotton
13655,hello jo now then well soon get you out of this
13656,well what do you want
13657,and if i do
13658,and if not
13659,yes only too easily
13660,very well then
13661,superior
13662,marshal you are quite mad
13663,well i gather that youve made a complete hash of things
13664,mmm hmm
13665,well whatever we do were bound to leave a few bald patches
13666,oh no no no of course not you were simply obeying orders thats a common excuse professor right now ill need a macrovisor the strongest one youve got
13667,the one you use in the transfer system
13668,well weve got to use it well have to train it on each affected area in turn like a searchlight
13669,i am jaeger i am but we shall need the beam to transfer the effect from this laboratory to the contaminated areas
13670,well we can hardly set it up on the surface of the planet now can we youve seen to that
13671,the marshals
13672,look for heavens sake stop dillydallying and lets get on with it these unstable reactions are dangerous i shall need some equipment if we dont come up with an effective control system well particle reverse skybase and well be in a bigger mess than we were before
13673,huh oh right carry on
13674,you do realise professor that the slightest accident in this stage of the proceedings
13675,now let it build up professor more more
13676,right now here goes activation beginning
13677,the nitrogen isotope level
13678,good then thats how it stays
13679,no
13680,well marshal it seems as if your superiors have arrived what are you going to do now
13681,criminal
13682,perhaps i can explain
13683,he means they were all plague victims they use the caves as a refuge
13684,yes mutant natives sir its a local term medically speaking accelerated genetic metamorphosis
13685,i am yes
13686,practically everything
13687,yes sir yes i would
13688,investigator these are the missing witnesses jo miss grant here is my assistant kept hostage
13689,kept hostage to ensure my cooperation in this travesty of justice investigator i accuse that man and that man of the most brutal and callous series of crimes against a defenceless people its ever been my misfortune to encounter       sondergaard
13690,not died marshal changed
13691,duty your idea of duty was to keep this planet for yourself
13692,yes yes of course
13693,er no im sorry sir i forgot the tablets are in the care of professor sondergaard
13694,im not sure sir somewhere on the surface of solos i believe
13695,well i can only reassure you that
13696,as i say i can assure you sir that conclusive evidence does exist
13697,this present mutation is one of a series of adaptive changes sir solos is moving out of spring into summer and that is why the solonians are changing
13698,this sir this is professor sondergaard whos worked and lived on solos for many years he can tell you better than i what the marshal has been doing there
13699,dont worry professor were holding a much needed investigation thank heavens youve arrived just in time to tell the investigator of our discoveries
13700,yes yes of course
13701,yes well we havent got hours but we do have this it will help me to accelerate the process i think
13702,im being as quick as i can jo
13703,well what else can we do we must try it if we hope to achieve a successful mutation that is
13704,so youve managed to wriggle out of trouble have you
13705,congratulations well what do you want now
13706,its all right investigator hes quite mad
13707,almost and my companions
13708,yes
13709,you do realise marshal that youre about to destroy a life form unique in the history of the universe
13710,as you wish
13711,change of heart marshal
13712,get down
13713,professor sondergaard has agreed to stay on solos and see as many of the solonians as possible through to the stage that ky has already achieved
13714,they were premature mutations jo the cycle of changes was triggered off too soon rather like butterflies that hatch out on a cold spring day their instincts were too confused to seek out and use the crystal
13715,yes yes of course but i wonder whether youd excuse us for the moment investigator my assistant is feeling rather faint
13716,no jo no you have been rather overdoing it you know and you
13717,you dont look too well
13718,come on will you excuse us well see you all later
13719,the storage area where we left the tardis
13720,oh no theyve locked it again
13721,give me that
13722,yes well at least weve made a clean sweep of this place jo    man
13723,jo jo jo
13724,oh oh i must have been dreaming
13725,yes volcanoes and earthquakes
13726,oh no no thatll have to wait no this is far more important it might make all the difference the next time he turns up
13727,the master of course jo now listen to me i want you to find out as quickly as possible if there have been any volcanic eruptions or severe earthquakes recently it doesnt matter where anywhere in the world
13728,believe me this is no matter for jokes
13729,does it say anything about a crystal
13730,mmm
13731,it was in my dream jo there was a large crystal shaped like a trident
13732,mmm
13733,no not now jo im busy
13734,oh
13735,thera it doesnt mean a thing to me
13736,oh lets forget all about it jo shall we i just had a nightmare thats all
13737,what
13738,yes i heard what you said but you said atlantis why atlantis
13739,give me that map captain yates
13740,of course of course
13741,jo get me the brigadier will you
13742,yes now
13743,hello brigadier its the doctor here now listen to me i want you to put out a world wide warning alert all your precious unit hqs not that itll do any good
13744,priority z one hundred and forty four i suppose
13745,look i tell you brigadier there is grave danger
13746,well im not sure but in my dream i quite clearly saw
13747,no i cant go anywhere at the moment im far too busy
13748,no certainly not jo i shall need you here with me
13749,transmission of matter through interstitial time
13750,extraordinary i could have sworn id told you its a time sensor
13751,do you well whats it do then
13752,mmm hmm
13753,well done jo youre learning exactly what you need if you happen to be looking for a tardis
13754,or any other time machine for that matter so if the master turns up again
13755,as you so rightly say bingo
13756,thank you
13757,oh thats venusian feet
13758,oh yeah much larger always tripping over themselves the venusians good thats good
13759,mmm
13760,i certainly didnt why
13761,thats impossible unless
13762,another tardis
13763,now i put it somewhere in that sector there anything between fifty and a hundred miles from here
13764,no not unless he switches his tardis on again
13765,if we were a bit nearer and in bessie
13766,do stop wiffling jo theres a good girl were not out on a pleasure jaunt you know
13767,only if it is the master we cant run the risk of losing him you just keep your eye on the time sensor
13768,yeah
13769,whats the bearing
13770,well thats venusian miles in earth miles thats be about seventy two point seven nine lets take a look at the map well were about here that should put us somewhere around there a village called wootton
13771,tomtit well if the masters behind that what times the demonstration
13772,weve got to stop it hang on tight jo
13773,nonsense its perfectly safe my reactions are ten times faster than yours bessies no ordinary car remember
13774,well the brakes work by the absorption of inertia including yours
13775,right come on bessie old girl its up to you now
13776,right jo jo
13777,then reverse the polarity
13778,reverse the temporal polarity
13779,who is this
13780,twenty five this mans eighty or more
13781,on the contrary jo i think were just in time
13782,well what he needs at the moment is rest well get him to the hospital later he must have been a pretty tough youngster
13783,well lucky for him otherwise the shock of the change would have finished him off
13784,yes hell survive
13785,no it was more than that
13786,well thats more like it jo but it still isnt the answer even if the metabolic rate had increased a hundredfold
13787,well of course it is even if it wasnt the change in him would have taken seven or eight months not eight seconds
13788,and that is
13789,congratulations brigadier i think youve provided the explanation
13790,the passing of time thats the only possible answer stuarts own personal time speeded up so enormously that his whole physiological life passed by in a moment but why how did it happen
13791,thascales really the arrogance of that man is beyond belief
13792,perhaps a classical education would have helped you brigadier thascales is a greek word
13793,right jo
13794,no no let him talk who did you see stuart answer me
13795,look answer me stuart who did you see
13796,be quiet both of you now answer me who did you see answer me
13797,kronos yes of course i should have known doctor ingram i want you to come with me i want you to tell me everything that you know about that machine of yours
13798,no no you stay here with stuart phone me immediately he starts talking again
13799,brigadier dont hang about i have a job for you too you know
13800,any trouble
13801,good good
13802,because i must find out whether im right thats why now wheres the crystal
13803,the crystal of kronos so i am right
13804,well itll be difficult to accept i warn you
13805,well luckily you are already familiar with the idea of stepping outside of spacetime
13806,and ive lived with it for many long years ive been there
13807,yes i have strange place it is too a place that is no place a dangerous place where creatures love beyond your wildest imagination kronovores time eaters they swallow a life as quickly as a boa constrictor can swallow a rabbit fur and all
13808,i am the most fearsome of the lot
13809,yes exactly and whats more one of those children in the legend was poseidon the god of atlantis
13810,well yes and no extraordinary people the atlanteans you know even more extraordinary than their cousins in athens once reality became unbearable for them they would invent a legend to tame it
13811,quite so kronos a living creature was drawn at a time by the priests of atlantis using that crystal as its centre
13812,it is and your friend the professor is trying to use that crystal as it was used four thousand years ago to capture the kronavore
13813,not just danger to our world sergeant or even our galaxy but to the entire created universe
13814,there are two things i dont quite understand though one is the massive power build up that you had and the second is the strength of the signal that i received on the time sensor
13815,yes indeed it does the strength of the signal was far too strong for an apparatus as crude as this however ah
13816,yes well i thought it would be around here somewhere
13817,yes indeed it did so theres only one thing left for us to do wouldnt you agree sergeant
13818,switch on and take a look for ourselves
13819,its reading ten already
13820,sergeant now youre a strong young man go in there and pick up that crystal will you
13821,its perfectly safe at this low level believe me
13822,i do
13823,no it isnt you know you can see it isnt
13824,no no of course you cant and do you know why you cant shift it because that crystal isnt really here at all its made the jump through interstitial time it must to be linked to that other crystal all those thousands of years ago or rather it is the other crystal
13825,where do you think in atlantis of course
13826,all right tell her that im on my way youd better stay here sergeant
13827,coming ruth er doctor ingram
13828,go on old chap go on youre doing fine
13829,why did you say kronos
13830,how did you know
13831,its a race memory we all have them
13832,later jo later go on stuart what else
13833,im sorry stuart i just dont know but i promise you that well do everything we possibly can to help you
13834,rest thats all you need at the moment until your body recovers from the shock
13835,are you sure he said he was from atlantis
13836,brigadier wait
13837,a massive feedback of time jo its too late kronos is coming
13838,just as i thought theyve run right into trouble jo you stay here
13839,theres really no time to explain now benton take the chair everybody inside quick
13840,thank you
13841,nothing at all theres nothing to be done except wait
13842,speaking personally id love a cup of tea how about it stuart
13843,a great deal for instance you brigadier you were caught in a hiatus in time being without becoming an ontological absurdity
13844,well you wouldnt be aware of it of course because your time had slowed down too
13845,yes so it would seem after all it did make a crack in time didnt it
13846,yes exactly were bound to experience all kinds of freak side effects
13847,correct
13848,no thank you jo
13849,well you stand right under a fountain you dont necessarily get wet do you
13850,me collecting
13851,well he must be stopped
13852,because we cant even find out what hes up to without the tardis a bottle i need a bottle
13853,no no that wont do one with a narrow neck a wine bottle
13854,yes thatll do nicely
13855,fine and the cork
13856,well done
13857,delaying tactics brigadier a small fly in the masters metaphorical ointment
13858,do give me a fork jo will you
13859,youre a philistine brigadier its not meant to be anything it just is i hope
13860,no certainly not its a time flow analogue
13861,the relationships between the different molecular bonds and the actual shapes form a crystalline structure of ratios
13862,patience brigadier patience now then here goes
13863,well it doesnt work
13864,thank you tea yes of course tea leaves
13865,well its just like jamming a radio signal jo we used to make them at school to spoil each others time experiments
13866,ah well it was fun while it lasted       yates
13867,well dont you see roundheads horsemen in armour the masters using that crystal to bring them back in time
13868,because it would be suicide to go anywhere without the protection of the tardis
13869,wed better go and fetch it come on come on jo brigadier are you coming
13870,do buck up lethbridge stewart
13871,mmm
13872,never why
13873,oh no
13874,listen
13875,oh yes it can displaced in time but thats real enough thats a v1
13876,a v1 a doodlebug a buzzbomb the germans used them towards the end of the hitler war
13877,jo out of the car get down
13878,jo can you spare me a moment
13879,oh dont worry captain well soon have her on her feet again
13880,its very low
13881,he must be testing before take off the power drain would have been enormous brigadier
13882,the master seems to be on the move again
13883,no no theres no time for that now ill have to take the tardis off from down there ill use the time sensor as a homing device and put my tardis inside his then wherever he goes ill go with him
13884,ill make contact as soon as possible
13885,we
13886,nothing i can say to dissuade you
13887,oh
13888,oh just a spot of redecoration thats all now jo you realise that what im about to do is going to be appallingly dangerous
13889,all right but youve been warned
13890,thank you right now then come over here and look at this
13891,now the two tardiss are operating on the same frequency you see now here comes the tricky part you see this
13892,this is the time setting now its critical to a billionth part of a nanosecond do you see
13893,now hold this  if its infinitesimally low well miss it entirely and goes whistling off to heaven knows where but if its too high even by a fraction of a moment whumph time ram
13894,yes you see the atoms making up this tardis would occupy precisely the same space and time as the atoms making up the masters tardis
13895,yes well of course it is so what do you think would happen
13896,yes exactly extinction utter annihilation now do you still want to come
13897,glad to have you aboard miss grant
13898,ah ha yes yes so far so good
13899,well thats the curious thing no time at all were outside time of course it always seems to take a long time but that depends upon the mood i suppose
13900,no no no hers no the tardiss
13901,it depends what you mean by alive doesnt it you take old bessie for instance right coming in to land now jo
13902,oh dear oh dear oh dear still that was always on the cards i suppose
13903,yes quite very curious effect that i wonder how it happened jo switch on the monitor will you lets see where we are
13904,no follow me
13905,exactly theyre both inside each other yeah i should have suspected that
13906,three guesses
13907,right first time
13908,were on our way jo the masters taken off for atlantis
13909,its because the tardis is operating out of phase thats why
13910,sorry about your coccyx jo but these little things are sent to try us
13911,coccyx your tailbone  master
13912,well i thought we might have a little chat  master
13913,hes not even listening hes turned the sound off
13914,weve got to make him listen its our only chance of stopping him
13915,no not if i can help it
13916,if hes turned his sound receiver off i must make myself heard without it
13917,thraskin oh its an archaic word seldom used since the twenty fifth dynasty the modern equivalent is plinge
13918,oh for heavens sake jo ive just told you it means thraskin
13919,inyups senupwat neas nees nig datdat sig ilshnimuwat ijnilguin nyup nyp  master
13920,english
13921,yes but backwards
13922,well hes picking up my words even before ive spoken them and feeding them back to me through the tardiss telepathic circuits making them come out backwards
13923,yes of course how else do you think they communicate well that decides it ive got no option now listen to me jo when i go out there i want you to
13924,what else can i do
13925,well ive got to risk it hes got to be stopped but thats no reason to put you into any danger now once i go out of that door i want you to close it all right
13926,yes and youll be safely locked in now youre not to open that door for anybody or anything until i say so
13927,jo youll do as youre told its your job remember
13928,wont you introduce me
13929,greetings to you krasis any friend of the masters is an enemy of mine
13930,yes i most certainly have     master
13931,youre mad paranoid
13932,hello jo
13933,there we are jo on our way to atlantis
13934,no not entirely but the time sensor will lead us to where the masters tardis is
13935,no i hope not not this time but well soon find out
13936,well well well isnt it a small world
13937,yes so it would seem
13938,weve come here to warn you that
13939,good afternoon now where have i seen that face before cant think of anything to say
13940,this is jo jo grant your majesty
13941,youll be all right
13942,nevertheless he did save our lives your majesty
13943,well why didnt you destroy the crystal
13944,yes of course its just like the tardis it has its being outside time and its appearance is here
13945,well if wisdom is to seek the truth i am yes
13946,yes but who is the guardian
13947,well its a harmless enough ambition i should have thought
13948,hes the minotaur
13949,it doesnt matter please go on
13950,what
13951,sorry to hold you up like this krasis but i need that key
13952,toro
13953,look out jo
13954,well cheer up jo now that weve found the crystal the masters little game is at an end
13955,thats where youre mistaken krasis and if you value your own life you will take me to see the king now
13956,does he really
13957,what happened to king dalios
13958,then hes still alive
13959,you dont mean to say that you still intend going ahead with this
13960,i wouldnt count on that
13961,any luck
13962,well well just have to play it by ear wont we
13963,well the whole of creation is very delicately balanced in cosmic terms jo if the master opens the floodgates of kronos power all order and all structure will be swept away and nothing will be left but chaos
13964,i felt like that once when i was young it was the blackest day of my life
13965,ah well thats another story ill tell you about it one day the point is that day was not only my blackest it was also my best
13966,well when i was a little boy we used to live in a house that was perched halfway up the top of a mountain and behind our house there sat under a tree an old man a hermit a monk hed lived under this tree for half his lifetime so they said and hed learned the secret of life so when my black day came i went and asked him to help me
13967,well im coming to that jo in my own time ah ill never forget what it was like up there all bleak and cold it was a few bare rocks with some weeds sprouting from them and some pathetic little patches of sludgy snow it was just grey grey grey grey well the tree the old man sat under that was ancient and twisted and the old man himself was he was as brittle and as dry as a leaf in the autumn
13968,nothing not a word he just sat there silently expressionless and he listened whilst i poured out my troubles to him i was too unhappy even for tears i remember and when id finished he lifted a skeletal hand and he pointed do you know what he pointed at
13969,a flower one of those little weeds just like a daisy it was well i looked at it for a moment and suddenly i saw it through his eyes it was simply glowing with life like a perfectly cut jewel and the colours well the colours were deeper and richer than you could possibly imagine yes that was the daisiest daisy id ever seen
13970,yes i laughed too when i first heard it so later i got up and i ran down that mountain and i found that the rocks werent grey at all but they were red brown and purple and gold and those pathetic little patches of sludgy snow they were shining white shining white in the sunlight you still frightened jo
13971,thats good im sorry i brought you to atlantis
13972,thank you
13973,dalios dalios
13974,is the master responsible for this
13975,what is it
13976,dalios we wont fail you dalios
13977,quite above himself isnt he
13978,what happened to the rest of the council
13979,are they alive
13980,then satisfy my curiosity now are they indeed alive or are they dead like king dalios
13981,the king is dead madame
13982,and you were responsible for his death
13983,no stop him stop him
13984,hell never obey you dont you understand yet what youve done hes uncontrollable
13985,jo jo come back jo jo
13986,jo are you all right
13987,dead what are you talking about youre no more dead than i am
13988,and i suppose were all in heaven
13989,yes yes its fascinating but somehow i dont think were in heaven
13990,well thats just it i dont know myself you shouldnt have put us into time ram jo in any case i was just about to do it myself
13991,now look jo i no not really
13992,you know me
13993,well you must forgive me but i cant quite place you
13994,where exactly are we
13995,yes the time ram
13996,well what now
13997,in the tardis
13998,thank you
13999,mighty kronos may i ask one last favour of you
14000,his life his freedom
14001,yes i know but would you allow us to deal with him in our way
14002,dont thank me youre coming back to earth with us
14003,no no kronos stop him stop him kronos
14004,jo would you condemn anybody to an eternity of torment even the master
14005,no well neither would i even though he was responsible for the destruction of atlantis
14006,yes right jo were about to land back in cambridge just think it all happened three thousand five hundred years ago
14007,whats going on here
14008,it seems to be working a bit too well
14009,its done its job everythings now back to normal
14010,a very good question brigadier
14011,yes of course
14012,yes of course
14013,thank you good grief
14014,thank you well its travelling faster than light
14015,why indeed professor tyler why indeed
14016,yes pass me a silicon rod will you
14017,lightning yes i suppose it could look like lightning only it isnt no if there where such a thing i would say it was compressed light a sort of controlled superlucent emission
14018,tell me professor is this machine of yours functioning properly
14019,then i suggest that you do so immediately and let me know the result of your findings jo you and i are going to take a look at the scene of the crime
14020,i think youll find everything you need here
14021,you havent seen your husband since this morning
14022,no no its not important
14023,yes jo yes its much more important than i thought
14024,right lets see what doctor tylers found out about that plate
14025,jo back slowly away behind the car do as i say
14026,when i tell you to run you run right run
14027,i dont know
14028,right come on
14029,no you wouldnt brigadier
14030,a flash yes not an explosion it was a release of kinetic energy
14031,no i shouldnt go anywhere near it not just at the moment
14032,i suggest that you put a guard on the drains benton
14033,yes the drains
14034,all right brigadier now then whats the situation as you see it
14035,yes i was rather afraid that might happen
14036,well i shouldnt bother going on looking for him brigadier i think youll find that thats mister ollis
14037,yes thats right
14038,nothings been moved
14039,excuse me a minute will you
14040,all right brigadier go on
14041,thank you it looks as if tyler was right that light beam or whatever it is seems to have scanned the earth like a searchlight and picked on us
14042,huh oh yes well brigadier now bessie has disappeared
14043,well some kind of powerful organism thing with a very strong hunting instinct
14044,yes yes im afraid so
14045,oh i dont know well perhaps this thing was confused or its instructions werent getting through
14046,tyler yeah yes that was its second mistake here in this laboratory where i usually work and its third mistake was bessie
14047,yes
14048,yes i do i think that that beam was the method it used to get here
14049,we dont find it brigadier if we wait around here long enough itll find us
14050,obviously from the same source as that organism thing first the scout then the reinforcements
14051,not much point in my going anywhere else is there
14052,now please jo do as i ask they wont harm you you ignore them theyll ignore you im the one theyre after
14053,sergeant benton just the man i wanted to see will you please take miss grant with you even if you have to carry her
14054,your orders sergeant
14055,well sergeant arent you going to say it that its bigger on the inside than it is on the outside everybody else does
14056,oh thank you for the complement
14057,i was planning to lure that stuff away from earth jo but now as it seems to have immobilised the tardis im not going anywhere were trapped
14058,at least we can watch that thing in comfort and then we can send in a report and see what they have to say about it
14059,yes they are
14060,thats odd nobody touched anything did they
14061,but you heard it though didnt you
14062,no i dont think so hello whats this
14063,well properly speaking its a recorder  doctor 2
14064,well its a bit difficult to explain jo
14065,well not so much one of them as one of us one of me to be precise  doctor 2
14066,now please youre only confusing my assistant jo its all quite simple i am he and he is me
14067,oh please be quiet
14068,yes yes im afraid so
14069,yes thats what id like to know youve got no right to be here  doctor 2
14070,theyll be all right as long as they keep out of its way right now you can see our problem cant you  doctor 2
14071,must you  doctor 2
14072,it was perfectly all right until you touched it now if only youd leave things to me  doctor 2
14073,i set this thing up
14074,what
14075,well its not easy you know  doctor 2
14076,heads    doctor 2
14077,now
14078,jo get back        doctor 2
14079,are you all right
14080,jo
14081,this is a place its just like any other place well almost weve been brought here anyway its not much like heaven is it come on lets go and take a look around      doctor 2
14082,thats odd
14083,yes
14084,well thats the brigadiers computer
14085,look this is the lab door
14086,well it says no admittance
14087,er jo do you see what i see
14088,that clinches it we have been transported and so has all this stuff come on
14089,where to
14090,right
14091,man friday would you believe
14092,come on        doctor 2
14093,its doctor tyler doctor tyler
14094,yes were at the other end of that light streak of yours
14095,weve been transported along it
14096,yes exactly thats where we are on a stable world in a universe of antimatter an anomaly within an impossibility
14097,well here we are kidnapped and marooned but by whom
14098,well these things sound very much like the creatures that attacked us at unit hq
14099,what exactly did they look like
14100,run
14101,its the entrance to some sort of palace i should imagine
14102,ive no idea but i expect well soon find out
14103,what
14104,my dear doctor tyler i dont want to get out i want to meet our host i allowed myself to be brought here for that very purpose
14105,dont you understand you were both brought here by accident your only chance of getting back lies in my persuading whoever brought you here to send you home
14106,doctor tyler youre not going anywhere
14107,i refuse to allow you to endanger all our lives
14108,tyler tyler come back tyler
14109,yes
14110,yes thats right jo im the one theyre after im sure i can persuade our host to send you back
14111,jo were dealing here with a creature of great intelligence and superior intelligence and senseless cruelty just do not go together
14112,tyler come on get up up up are you all right
14113,thats right
14114,yes well our bodies have been converted processed in some ways so that we can exist here
14115,yes exactly
14116,but things arent always as they seem you know doctor tyler now you take this pencil for example
14117,ah but is it watch very very closely
14118,yes thats exactly what this place is a scientific conjuring trick of a very high order i think the waiting is over
14119,yes most impressive i must admit that
14120,who are you
14121,omega but thats impossible omega was destroyed
14122,where are you taking them
14123,you knew your mission was dangerous
14124,you were the solar engineer it was your duty
14125,well you succeeded and are revered for it
14126,the histories say that you were lost in the supernova
14127,no not forgotten all my life ive known of you and honoured you as our greatest hero
14128,well theoretically of course all this is quite impossible
14129,thank you tell me how did you manage to survive
14130,and this organism stuff that you sent to bring us here
14131,but how do i fit into this picture
14132,oh i see
14133,and if i give you my help do you really think you can defeat the time lords all of them
14134,and if i refuse to cooperate
14135,them
14136,oh please if youd only listen to me
14137,look if you cannot reverse the energy drain the fabric of the entire universe could be torn apart
14138,then you would be utterly alone forever
14139,omega if you would undo the harm that youve done and resume your place on the high council you could have the freedom to do anything that you wished
14140,oh just some more innocent bystanders probably scooped up by that bungling organism of yours send them back omega they can do you no harm
14141,and it has done so
14142,now omega
14143,yes im afraid so
14144,i tell you i practically had him won over then you turned up and he started treating me like an imposter  doctor 2
14145,yes well all right im sorry perhaps i did speak a trifle sharply  doctor 2
14146,oh ask jo theres a good chap you see one minute he was talking about destroying everything  doctor 2
14147,look you explain to him youre far better at it than i am  doctor 2
14148,yes well it does exist right here im afraid
14149,now that is how omega is able to create the world we are now living in by a fantastic effort of his will but unfortunately he thinks hes been wronged by the time lords
14150,yes and now hes hell bent on revenge
14151,a time lord one of the greatest of all my race  doctor 2
14152,yes thats true
14153,no thats useless in this world the only natural law here is the law of omegas will
14154,yes
14155,that might work it just might  doctor 2
14156,well done  doctor 2
14157,jo you wait there  doctor 2
14158,the bull by the horns eh  doctor 2
14159,by combining our wills against yours  doctor 2
14160,yes if i must
14161,thank you omega a most interesting demonstration
14162,all this exists because you have willed singularity to create it all for you
14163,please ignore him just ignore him hes incorrigibly frivolous  doctor 2
14164,what the hell do you think youre trying to do  doctor 2
14165,no no i was just explaining to my associate here that he should show you more respect for both our sakes  doctor 2
14166,but why
14167,so the moment you abandon control you cannot escape and you cannot escape without abandoning control
14168,we will obey you omega  doctor 2
14169,because beneath that mask there is nothing left of you the corrosion has already done its work
14170,you exist only because your will insists that you exist your will is all that is left of you
14171,come on out
14172,thats funny i could have sworn i left bessie here  doctor 2
14173,come on inside come on brigadier inside inside    doctor 2
14174,well there you are then they cant get in  doctor 2
14175,well i excuse me someones trying to get through to us  doctor 2
14176,yes what is it
14177,we think weve found a way of dealing with omega
14178,later old chap if theres still time
14179,how do we know that hell take the generator what if he should refuse  doctor 2
14180,it means brigadier that we can now strike a bargain with our friend omega
14181,this box of tricks as you call it is a kind of portable force field  doctor 2
14182,right switch on  doctor 2
14183,now jo please do as i ask do exactly as i tell you do you promise
14184,good are you ready stand by here we go
14185,we have come to set you free
14186,on one condition
14187,omega if you will send these people back to where they came from we will stay and help you
14188,we shall give you that promise omega we will not attempt to leave this world before you do
14189,brigadier i want all of you to step through that column of smoke
14190,dont be alarmed it wont harm you on the contrary it will take you back home  doctor 2
14191,yes of course im sure
14192,jo please
14193,trust me
14194,take it
14195,come on quick  the portable force field fizzles and a new star flares in the middle of the black hole
14196,i told you he had no selfcontrol didnt i
14197,oh back where he came from i imagine
14198,and when omega knocked it out of our hands and it fell out of the force field all the atoms and the antiatoms annihilated one another
14199,exactly  doctor 2
14200,yes wasnt i
14201,goodbye
14202,yes for us
14203,i didnt exactly trick him i promised him his freedom and i gave it to him the only freedom he could ever have
14204,the time lords look theyve sent me a new dematerialisation circuit and my knowledge of time travel law and all the dematerialisation codes theyve all come back theyve forgiven me theyve given me back my freedom
14205,no not straight away jo of course not ive got to build a new force field generator first
14206,look i tell you theres no need for a test jo ive been here before and the air is perfectly
14207,yeah thats odd
14208,yes yes gaseous sulphides low concentration nothing to worry about
14209,well i can assure you that the last time i was here the air was like wine
14210,where
14211,jo i dont steer the tardis i programme it and according to programme this is metebelis three the famous blue planet of the acteon group
14212,thats extraordinary we appear to be in some kind of a machine
14213,yes youre right come on
14214,well to find out where we are of course
14215,yes well we may have slightly overshot the blue planet but we must be on one of planets in the group well soon see
14216,what is it
14217,well lets take a look shall we
14218,greetings
14219,jo when youve travelled as much as i have youll learn never to judge by appearances these creatures may look like chickens but for all we know theyre the intelligent life form on this planet
14220,singapore
14221,oh jo do come on
14222,shush
14223,appearances can be very deceiving jo theres something wrong here
14224,no thats impossible
14225,no thats impossible too come on but keep low
14226,no theres only one explanation
14227,this isnt earth it just looks like it
14228,1926
14229,no
14230,come on jo
14231,back to the tardis
14232,well i dont know whats happening here but i dont like it why do you want to stay
14233,thats a plesiosaurus
14234,its incredible if this really is 1926 the plesiosaurus has been extinct for a hundred and thirty million years
14235,come on
14236,hello topping day what
14237,er yes but only temporarily
14238,on that contrary sir
14239,yes
14240,yes
14241,yes thats an excellent idea major ill have a large scotch
14242,i told you we should have left i wanted to
14243,any more of these about on the ship or is this the only one
14244,these is this the only one  it is a hexagonal steel plate about an inch high apparently riveted to the floor and easy to trip over
14245,dont underestimate us sir
14246,i didnt but i do now it makes everything much clearer thank you
14247,hmm
14248,yes relatively speaking an extinct monster that plate out there on the deck yes this is all most interesting
14249,what
14250,oh yes its been blocked from his consciousness yes if im right it would have to be its certainly no part of the fabric of this ship
14251,a great lump of what its not steel copper or iron that metal is unknown on earth jo
14252,no
14253,oh look dalys been keeping track of the date
14254,well in its time the ss bernice was as famous a sea mystery as the marie celeste
14255,nobody really knows a freak tidal wave was the popular explanation although the indian ocean was as flat as a millpond on that night
14256,no she vanished jo two days out from bombay on june the 4th 1926 the ss bernice just disappeared off the face of the earth
14257,yes intriguing isnt it
14258,mmm hmm
14259,well
14260,oh youve noticed that have you well done shall i tell you something that you may not have noticed its broad daylight outside
14261,if this really is after dinner and we are in the indian ocean it should be pitch dark
14262,no that only works on electronic locks jo we need something far more primitive
14263,oh theyd do fine if only we had any
14264,it slides open
14265,antimagnetic cohesion i should think
14266,no you wouldnt have done jo you were born about a thousand years too early for that
14267,without a magnetic core extractor no
14268,on the contrary i happen to have got one in the tardis
14269,yes i know getting to the tardis
14270,they can only lock us up again cant they
14271,come on
14272,yes i know
14273,shush     claire
14274,in a minute jo if my theorys right we should be getting confirmation any minute now
14275,about whats happening to this ship
14276,yes well naturally you see theyve all been programmed to repeat a simple behaviour pattern
14277,very probably
14278,yes exactly historically speaking this collection is a bit of a jumble i must admit
14279,jo have you ever seen any small boys collecting sea creatures and putting them into a rock pool
14280,and then after a minute all the sea creatures settle down and behave quite normally quite naturally its only the small boys looking down from above that see the change in the environment
14281,yes and they were collected by a slightly more sophisticated means than a bucket of water but everything is relative jo
14282,yes well dont worry about it right stand by for blasting
14283,shush right go and hide
14284,hang on a minute jo ill get the magnetic core extractor
14285,what is it jo
14286,up there
14287,yes the whole deckhead swings open
14288,yes and probably held in place by two tiny little wingnuts
14289,relatively speaking you saw the size of that hand
14290,thats what it looks like
14291,i told you this was no ordinary ship jo
14292,to find the tardis and that means finding a way off this ship
14293,yes very probably  andrews
14294,no not while were inside this thing weve got to get out of here come on
14295,oh hello topping day what
14296,yes ninety nine skidoo well must press on pip pip old chap
14297,youve asked us that question once before dont you remember
14298,you see jo no memory traces at all
14299,youve forgotten our names
14300,im afraid so old chap
14301,and i think i ought to warn you that i took lessons from  john l sullivan
14302,queensbury rules
14303,good afternoon
14304,whos counting
14305,hold it flat run it along the edge of the plate
14306,thats the idea
14307,no you cant
14308,and here that should do it yes
14309,good down we go
14310,what is it my dear girl this is a perfect example of an early pulse mechanism based on the principal of caesium decay oh this is absolutely vintage stuff
14311,well of course it isnt i told you were no longer in the ship
14312,ive no idea probably outside this machine entirely and just look at this jo what a magnificent auxiliary capillary pump have you ever seen anything like it
14313,we could try following this circuit itll probably run for miles though
14314,i dont know hold on jo
14315,come on keep moving
14316,come on jo get up
14317,come on get yourself up come on give us your hand come on up there here mop yourself down with this
14318,well it just a bit hot didnt it
14319,who
14320,well why should they jo weve done them no harm
14321,look one problem at a time eh our problem is to find our way out of here this looks quite promising lets try it eh
14322,right come on now come on quick as you can
14323,thats it thats it there
14324,no no no all these shafts look very much alike
14325,yes you are right we must have been this way before
14326,of course were not lost jo what makes you think that see this you know what that is thats a bearing housing for one of the ventilator shafts
14327,yeah i thought it might
14328,it means there should be an air duct around here somewhere
14329,well wheres air ducted from jo
14330,right first time
14331,yes i know the trouble is were inside the blueprint instead of looking down on it
14332,yes come on
14333,no its just the same
14334,oh some sort of marsh gas probably highly inflammable come on wed better take a look around
14335,no neither do i
14336,i dont know but it didnt sound very friendly
14337,it couldnt have seen us jo it must be hunting by scent
14338,us im afraid its following our outward trail
14339,theres more than one of those things about jo lets go
14340,come on jo
14341,but you must were nearly there
14342,run for it jo
14343,no time to talk about that now jo lets get out of here come on
14344,no i thought it was at first though
14345,yes by jingo ive got it i know what this is
14346,were in a miniscope
14347,yes you know jo its like its like one of those things those glass cases that people keep colonies of ants in
14348,thats right jo and you and i are inside its works
14349,very probably
14350,no not necessarily jo thoughtless maybe
14351,well havent you ever been to the zoo have you never kept goldfish in a bowl
14352,we are to those creatures up there jo roll up roll up roll up and see these funny little creatures in their native habitat watch them go through their funny little tricks poke them with a stick and make them jump
14353,no oh no believe me im just as angry as you are as a matter of fact i had a great deal to do with the banning of these miniscopes
14354,yes i did i managed to persuade the high council of the time lords they were an offence against the dignity of sentient lifeforms
14355,yes well they dont as a rule but frankly i made such a nuisance of myself well they banned the things
14356,i dont know officially they were all called in and destroyed
14357,it looks like it the tardis must have materialised in its compression field
14358,yeah but not for long jo well soon get out of here
14359,come on jo its time we got out of here
14360,weve one advantage over them jo were smaller than them
14361,yes if we keep to the narrow sections we can move faster
14362,come on quick down this way come on come on give me your hand come on thats it thats the idea quick as you can
14363,well logically there should be an extractor down there well if id designed it there would be one
14364,yes persistent little beggars arent they
14365,i wonder
14366,things do look a little difficult at the moment i must admit
14367,not impossible jo nothings impossible theres always an answer if you can find it
14368,well thats the trouble finding it now i think this is the time for lateral thinking
14369,well instead of approaching the problem from head on you approach it sort of sideways
14370,yes take our own particular example for a moment eh this is our problem we cant go forward because this shaft is too steep we cant go back the way we came because of our hungry little friends here
14371,well i didnt mean it quite so literally jo if we move sideways well find ourselves back on the ship
14372,i am
14373,right hang on a minute lets take a look at the plan
14374,now according to this plan there should be a way back on the ship just around the corner come on
14375,right its all clear come on
14376,about a dozen fathoms i should think
14377,ah heres some here
14378,no man dont youll blow us all to bits dont
14379,will you kindly stop referring to me as the creature sir or i may well become exceedingly hostile
14380,the tribunal is not deliberating the tribunal is arguing and quite nonsensically if i may say so
14381,will one of you kindly explain to me exactly where i am which planet i mean
14382,inter minor not metebelis three the famous blue planet of the acteon galaxy
14383,i see oh thank heavens the tardis is safe anyway
14384,yes it is indeed and oh yes just as i thought a miniscope now this is outrageous who is responsible for this device is it yours
14385,and you sir you are
14386,well im sorry to have to tell you gentlemen but you are all in very serious trouble
14387,you are i take it the representatives of authority on this planet
14388,then you have allowed the importation and the operation of a machine that is expressly forbidden by intergalactic law
14389,but for the moment the machine is here and it is in operation surely youll scarcely deny that
14390,then you are responsible are you not as a direct result of your carelessness my young companion is trapped inside this machine in a situation of extreme peril
14391,if you will allow me to rescue my young companion and give what help i can to the rest of the unfortunates trapped in here then i am prepared to overlook the entire matter
14392,if not then youll just have to take the consequences let me know when youve made up your mind
14393,thank you for your timely intervention sir
14394,just over there
14395,i beg your pardon
14396,im sorry
14397,i must apologise im afraid i do not understand your language
14398,are you a showman sir
14399,delighted miss shirna i am the doctor
14400,tell me sir are you in charge of this disgraceful device
14401,yes something is very wrong i too have an assistant you know and shes trapped inside this machine now somehow ive got to get her out
14402,drashigs
14403,what lose them that would be a tragedy
14404,livestock let me tell you sir that the people inside that ship are human beings
14405,the collection of the simplest animal lifeforms is a dubious enough pursuit in itself sir but the collection of civilised intelligent beings is a positive crime now let me warn you that i intend to put an end to this shameful business
14406,huh what does that mean
14407,how long will it last
14408,well that means that every living creature in there will die including my assistant now somehow ive got to find a way of saving them
14409,vorg
14410,listen vorg i shall need your help ive got to get back inside this machine
14411,well its the only way i can get jo out of there in time and save the rest of your livestock but i shall need you to trigger the settings for me
14412,look this is your machine isnt it
14413,then i presume you know how it works
14414,he what
14415,yes yes i have seen something similar you say you won this machine and you havent the faintest idea how it works i see well look this wallarian that you got it from did he by any chance give you a green or a blue disc a thing about this big
14416,well go and have a look will you its very important
14417,well its simple really you see the scopes er omega circuit is broken now if i can link it to the tardis and use that as the master i can reprogramme the scope
14418,well two things i hope itll enable me to get jo out of here in time and get her out of this wretched contraption and it will return all the other lifeforms to their original space time coordinates
14419,i sincerely hope so yes
14420,yes thats it thank heavens you kept it look come with me and ill tell you what i want you to do er would you mind just waiting there for a moment
14421,yes of course itll work
14422,then dont touch any bare metal right now listen to me this is the phase one switch here and this is the phase two now dont touch the phase two until the last possible moment do you understand
14423,good
14424,whats the icca
14425,prison
14426,oh yes yes very much so phase one
14427,look stop asking silly questions and come on
14428,come on jo
14429,come on
14430,come on the circuits are going
14431,come on jo come on one last effort were nearly there
14432,vorg vorg the phase two switch
14433,hello vorg well you cut that a bit fine didnt you
14434,its all right jo its all right jo weve made it
14435,others
14436,well i reversed the original settings and linked them to the tardis so they should still be on the ship
14437,yes exactly
14438,i dont think we need worry too much about our friend vorg
14439,oh come on jo be reasonable
14440,well we didnt hit it did we
14441,well by a rather brilliant last minute course correction ive managed to materialise the tardis inside the spaceship but to avoid hitting it ive had to make a random jump back into normal space
14442,well if im going to get us back to earth id better find out where we are ill just go and check the instruments
14443,and ive got a pretty good idea about when
14444,look at what
14445,well its just a space ship jo you know i reckon we must be somewhere in the twenty sixth century well interstellar travels pretty routine by now
14446,mmm
14447,well i did hear something but very faintly come on jo lets go and find the crew i want to find the exact date for my calculations
14448,what
14449,well thats interesting they must be going to do a link up
14450,well the two ships are joined together by a sort of tunnel you see with two airlocks well then they equalise the pressure allowing the crew to move from one ship to the other without using spacesuits well otherwise theyd have to get all kitted up and do a space walk
14451,look jo dont worry well be on our way soon now lets go and take look at the ships calendar
14452,i said how do you do
14453,gun i havent got a gun this is simply my hand
14454,jo whats the matter with you
14455,nonsense its simply a man with a gun now pull yourself together
14456,im not sure jo something rather intriguing  pilot
14457,oh so thats what its all about  pilot
14458,look
14459,well thats the way they see us i suppose
14460,its got to be some nonhuman life form something that theyre frightened of dragons dragons yes of course draconians
14461,well if this is the period that i think it is there are two great empires spreading their way through the galaxy of the milky way
14462,those were the declining years of earths planetary empire this is just the beginning now earth and draconia are both been expanding you see colonising one planet after another and theyre sitting on a powder keg
14463,no draconians no dragons is rather an unflattering nickname well you remember that sound you heard
14464,and the man that you saw with the gun
14465,no you didnt jo that sound made you see what you fear most
14466,well it shouldnt be too difficult ultrasonics geared to stimulate the fear centres of the brain something like that
14467,well difficult to say it seems to act like a sort of posthypnotic command itll fade eventually of course
14468,why indeed
14469,well thats one consolation isnt it
14470,im reversing the polarity of my ultrasonic screwdrivers power source thereby converting it into an extremely powerful electromagnet
14471,you wait and see jo
14472,yes i think so
14473,nearly there there you are  thats it
14474,well they havent boarded yet theyre still breaking through that door now try and be logical man
14475,back to the tardis jo back
14476,jo  jo
14477,must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun i wonder why they didnt kill me what exactly happened jo
14478,mmm
14479,oh
14480,well try and get the tardis back of course why should the ogrons attack this ship
14481,no no theres more to it than that that sound that you heard its all too sophisticated for the ogrons
14482,yeah the question is where
14483,no not necessarily no the ogrons are mercenaries other life forms use them to do their dirty work come on jo lets go and find the crew
14484,well if they hadnt wed have both been done for all the air would have escaped when the ships unlocked
14485,well maybe theyve got kind hearts theres good in everyone you know jo  gardiner
14486,hello battle cruiser battle cruiser this is the cargo ship over  gardiner
14487,dont worry old chap youll be all right now i think
14488,passengers
14489,including some rather valuable property of mine
14490,oh thank you very much
14491,well were here arent we
14492,i was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations old chap
14493,now if youll only listen to me
14494,listen the ships theyre unlocking
14495,thats what hes there for isnt it
14496,and then what
14497,jo this ships already going back to earth
14498,look jo
14499,will you stop pacing up and down like a perishing panda now come and sit down let me think will you thats better
14500,because the true facts have been erased from their minds thats why
14501,they dont know that theyre lying jo theyre desperately trying to fit us into their version of things
14502,well when we get back to earth weve got to reach someone in authority whose mind isnt already closed
14503,jo look these people believe that the draconians are attacking their spaceships right
14504,and we know that theyre wrong dont we
14505,well we also know that the ogrons couldnt possibly have created that hallucinatory device that makes the earthmen think theyre draconians
14506,right
14507,well twelve minutes to be exact jo
14508,id like to get a message through to your president
14509,yes
14510,oh you dont want to worry about those things jo as long as you tell them the truth they cant do you any harm
14511,no of course not well theyre only sort of computers with a few extra knobs on and you know how stupid computers can be dont you now come and sit down stop worrying come on sit down did i ever tell you the story about how i was once captured by the medusoids
14512,medusoids how can i describe them to you well theyre a sort of hairy jellyfish with claws teeth and a leg
14513,anyway they put me under one of these mind probes things you see and tried to get me to tell them where i was going so i said i was on my way to meet a giant rabbit a pink elephant and a purple horse with yellow spots
14514,well the poor old machine just couldnt believe it had a nervous breakdown
14515,well they put me under another one of these mind probe things and the same thing happened
14516,a purple horse with yellow spots yes i was you see they were all delegates for the third intergalactic peace conference
14517,well they had to turn me loose eventually
14518,they ran out of mind probes
14519,madam i can assure that ive never been employed by anybody least of all by the draconians
14520,if we really were working for the draconians why did they leave us in your ship
14521,allow me to congratulate you sir you have the most totally closed mind that ive ever encountered madam i beg of you to listen to me some third party is trying to provoke war between earth and draconia you are both being duped
14522,ive no idea madam but believe me that is what is happening
14523,now please listen to me if you dont youll be involved in a war that could cause the death of millions
14524,ive got to get them to listen to me for their sakes as well as ours
14525,well that was a draconian with the president you know obviously an ambassador of some kind
14526,well clearly earth and draconia are on the brink of war and they both believe its the others fault
14527,well i can but try yeah seems a fairly conventional type of electronic lock rather oldfashioned really here goes
14528,why
14529,not unless you give me some good reason
14530,are you sure its the president and not another ridiculous interrogation
14531,come on jo perhaps we can convince them after all
14532,well i must say its very nice of you gentlemen to invite me here and where is miss grant
14533,dont you realise what youve done youve now finally convinced them that were both draconian agents
14534,my dear chap ive already been through all this with the president of earth she thinks im working for you
14535,im what
14536,yes i couldnt agree with you more thats exactly what ive been trying to say to you the earth cargo ship was not attacked by draconians
14537,i can assure you that it was attacked but by ogrons
14538,yes some third partys employing them trying to make trouble between earth and draconia
14539,my dear chap nobody is more devoted to the cause of peace than i am but i cannot tell you something that i dont know
14540,dont you realise youre completely on the wrong tack there is a plot yes but the earthmen are not behind it any more than you are
14541,ive been paying a brief but unwilling visit to the draconian embassy and im afraid i had to leave in rather a hurry and found myself back here
14542,well believe it or believe it not jo they think were working for general williams and trying to provoke a war
14543,yes earth is blaming draconia and draconia is blaming earth
14544,thats about it whats the matter
14545,get down that was close         secretary
14546,you can suit yourself but i warn you youre wasting your time
14547,no
14548,i came here in my own ship the tardis
14549,yes my own spaceship
14550,i didnt in any case it wasnt the draconians it was the ogrons
14551,i wouldnt do that old man i know these machines they arent awfully reliable you know
14552,theres just no telling some people is there my dear
14553,no
14554,they dont
14555,in the tardis
14556,no one
14557,i dont know
14558,im telling you the truth
14559,mmm hmm apart from a bit of a headache i like the new outfit who are you fighting tonight what happened to you anyway
14560,yes awkward isnt it well theyve made up their minds you see theyll only believe us if we tell them what they want to hear its a pity really that the ogrons didnt succeed in kidnapping us perhaps we should have been more helpful
14561,well if they had succeeded presumably theyd have taken us to where the tardis is im sorry jo im afraid another kidnapping attempt is our only ray of hope
14562,thats about it yes
14563,see you later
14564,madam president ive been telling you the truth for some considerable time but you just wont believe me
14565,well thats very generous of you madam but youd only be buying information that doesnt exist
14566,what without a trial without even a chance to state my case so youre just tucking me quietly away are you what about my companion
14567,but you will see that she comes to no harm
14568,id like to madam i really would but theres nothing that i can say that youd believe may i say goodbye to her
14569,oh its a long story i dont think youd believe me even if i told you
14570,not particularly no
14571,have you got many political prisoners here
14572,well you might put it like that yes yes i tried to stop a war
14573,did you how long is your sentence
14574,now thats stealing you know
14575,thats what im in for
14576,good im glad to hear it
14577,i thought you said there were no common criminals here
14578,dont any of you try to escape
14579,it seems a perfectly natural question
14580,including planning to escape
14581,oh why doesnt anybody ever try
14582,no no quite so but theres got to be a first time for everything hasnt there come on professor come and tell me all you know about the layout here
14583,is this all we get
14584,mmm and absolutely nothing to make it enjoyable eh
14585,not exactly friendly are they
14586,no tell me professor when do you plan to escape
14587,but youre going to try
14588,if i were id hardly be drawing attention to myself quite so quickly now would i
14589,youve little or no alternative professor were all in this sector together whatever you do i shall know about it
14590,oh i was sent here at the express wish of a certain general williams
14591,ill tell you something there is a conspiracy to start a war between earth and draconia
14592,but theres also a third party professor who is plotting to set the two empires at each others throats
14593,well there you are there you have it thats how i came to be here
14594,good grief do you know sir youre the first person whos believed me
14595,what is it whats up
14596,come on professor come on you were giving off conspiracy in waves over there you can trust me you know
14597,who are you taking with you
14598,well thats very generous of you but
14599,well it was telling my story on earth that got me sent here in the first place
14600,thank you professor you dont know what it means to me to have found allies at last
14601,take this one
14602,tell me professor why is cross helping you
14603,thats extraordinary i would have thought he would have wanted something far more positive than promises     dale
14604,whats that i thought i heard something
14605,all right
14606,well it certainly is take a look for yourself there look at the gauge yes and so is this one theyre both empty professor
14607,theyre depressurising dont you understand man theyre pumping out the air
14608,they certainly wont if we dont try
14609,professor dont shout youll just waste oxygen
14610,you yes i might have guessed
14611,i also believe there was a conspiracy to destroy this man because hes politically dangerous to you
14612,with no oxygen in the cylinders
14613,and i take it we that also locked ourselves in the airlock from the outside and switched off the air supply
14614,and may i ask what im supposed to have done there
14615,i seem to be quite the master criminal dont i you dont mean to say that you really believe all this nonsense do you governor whatever credentials that hes shown you are forged
14616,hello jo
14617,how are you all right
14618,you know id very much like to know why
14619,no why im still alive
14620,yes well whatever it is youre up to you neednt expect any help from me
14621,stolen of course
14622,er may i ask where were going
14623,right now listen to me we havent got much time before he gets back to the flight deck now the first thing weve got to do is to escape now they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison but they didnt get a hold of this
14624,no not yet lets wait until he gets back to the flight deck then hell set the controls now this is an automatic spaceship once were underway the computers take over right
14625,now this is what were going to do
14626,i didnt steal it i just borrowed it i fully intended to return it i assure you anyway she wasnt exactly the latest model poor old thing
14627,ill tell you i made a complete fool of that prosecuting council though i ridiculed his every argument yes and i told him that i had the complete answer to every one his charges against me
14628,then what happened well they found me guilty changed my appearance and exiled me to earth
14629,as i soon realised the trouble with lethbridge stewart is that hes got a military mind
14630,no thats the trouble though hes hidebound you see he always does everything by the rules i keep telling him i said there are times you know when youve simply got to cut right through the red tape
14631,yes ive managed to cut right through it
14632,oh no you dont    jo
14633,hello we appear to have company
14634,well i should try and be a bit more hospitable old chap come on put that gun away theyve probably got us outnumbered
14635,now dont believe this man hes lying
14636,captain you cannot condemn us without a trial now i have vital information for your emperor at least give me the chance to speak to him
14637,well personally im quite happy to be going to draconia jo perhaps we can convince the emperor what our friend here has been trying to do
14638,well this wont be my first visit to draconia you know many years ago i spent quite some time there i was able to help them through a period of very great difficulty
14639,well its a long time ago things may have changed but i do understand the draconian mentality jo it all depends how you approach them
14640,well wake you with a cup of tea in the morning
14641,well thats it then come on weve landed
14642,hes awake already hes just trying to show us how unconcerned he is
14643,may i have permission to address the emperor
14644,my life at your command sire
14645,ah but i am a noble of draconia the honour was conferred on me by the fifteenth emperor
14646,your majesty this man that you speak of was he not known as the doctor and did he not come to this planet in a spaceship called the tardis
14647,well i am that man sire and i come from a race of people that live far longer than any earthman
14648,it is true your majesty i did come here as a prisoner but i came willingly in order to warn you that this man is plotting a war between earth and draconia
14649,ah but the master is not an earthman im sorry to have to admit it but hes a renegade of my own race and hes using creatures called ogrons to attack your spaceships and those of the earthmen
14650,im sorry but there you are in error sir your people have seen ogrons but they appear to them as earthmen because of a hypnotic device
14651,a wise decision your majesty for only by earth and draconia working together can we hope to arrive at the truth
14652,you feeling all right old chap
14653,your majesty i beg of you to be cautious something is seriously wrong here this ship that has just landed i beg you place it under guard immediately
14654,your majesty look down here and tell me what do you see
14655,jo jo can you still hear that sound
14656,your majesty i beg of you please look again
14657,why does the master want war between earth and draconia
14658,youd only be wasting your time the ogrons have got the finest defence mechanism of all stupidity they havent got a mind for you to probe
14659,and fear breeds hatred your majesty fear is the greatest enemy of them all for fear leads us to war
14660,the prince is right your majesty we must mount an expedition at once and we must take the ogron as evidence
14661,hello jo hows your ogron friend
14662,were just about to cross the frontier into earth space
14663,well this is an earth police spaceship you know sir
14664,well it looks like another spaceship it appears to be following us
14665,theyre closing in perhaps its a frontier patrol ship coming to investigate us
14666,we can try we should be within audio range hello this is earth police spaceship two three nine oh on a special mission to the president of earth do you read me do you read me over     doctor
14667,hello earth police spaceship one four two  hello weve recaptured this ship and are taking it back to earth over  master
14668,yes but they unfortunately didnt know that did they hello earth police spaceship we are reducing speed as you request over
14669,yes exactly thats why i want to get them into visual scanner range
14670,we should be able to pick them up on the visual scanner now
14671,hold tight im taking evasive action
14672,no no im afraid were outgunned this isnt a battlecruiser you know
14673,hes broken out get out jo
14674,right there you are my friend
14675,weve been boarded we need the blasters come on
14676,dont worry about him hes no use to us at the moment  jo
14677,we should be all right in a minute the shipll pump in more oxygen     earth captain
14678,then we must mount an expedition to the planet of the ogrons the proof we need is there madam
14679,my dear chap im not asking for a battlefleet all i require is one small spaceship
14680,then can i take it sir that you will now authorise the expedition
14681,your royal highness could you convince your people they were not being attacked by earthmen
14682,wed better leave at once madam president
14683,right thirtyfour seconds a course correction to galactic coordinates two three four nine six seven eight four
14684,well not completely uninhabited general williams thats where the ogrons planet is
14685,certainly from the master he fed the coordinates into his ships computer when i was his prisoner and after youd captured the ship sir i extracted the information from the ships memory banks
14686,somehow i dont think theyre in the mood for explanations at this minute can you outrun them
14687,right were out of range now
14688,well we were infringing draconian space after all your royal highness
14689,do you know exactly whats wrong
14690,right well you hold her steady ill go and effect the repairs
14691,naturally
14692,ive no idea old chap
14693,im being as quick as i can     doctor
14694,pilot can you get her into a closer orbit
14695,well well just have to risk it we cant see anything from up here
14696,can you boost it up  jo
14697,jo must have fixed up some kind of homing device
14698,doesnt it strike you as being a bit too convenient
14699,can you get her down
14700,williams look another one
14701,yes well lets hope we dont encounter one
14702,ive no idea old chap well find out when we get there come on cant be far
14703,ive no idea but whatever it is its on our side
14704,i dont know ive got a feeling some sort of premonition
14705,yes come on
14706,no hes unarmed
14707,no no dont its no good
14708,oh i suppose i should thank you for saving my life
14709,hello jo
14710,because war will mean the extermination of both empires your royal highness and the daleks will emerge as the supreme rulers now somehow weve got to get out of here and stop them
14711,well done jo
14712,there is one thing we can do though and itll need a very slight adjustment
14713,general williams if we do manage to get out of here and jo and i manage to create a diversion could you find your way back to your spaceship
14714,good right that should do it now i want you to take off immediately get the truth back to your respective governments
14715,tell them that they must mount a joint expedition and capture this base at once
14716,no well need you to convince the emperor your royal highness
14717,jo i presume that the tardis is still here
14718,well dont worry about us our spaceship is here
14719,yes well would you mind blocking your ears and covering your eyes just for a moment
14720,no but i think you will in a moment just do as i ask would you you too jo
14721,can you
14722,good er how much longer are you going to keep us locked in here
14723,well thats fascinating
14724,yes im not surprised weve seen the real thing havent we theyre probably more frightened of him than they are of the daleks
14725,general williams
14726,your royal highness
14727,you know you really are incredibly persistent arent you
14728,oh yes yes a most ingenious device i congratulate you
14729,help me up
14730,help me into the tardis jo
14731,the first thing weve got to do is get out of here
14732,telepathic circuits sending a message to the time lords  ltback to the episode listing
14733,help me up
14734,help me into the tardis jo
14735,the first thing weve got to do is get out of here
14736,telepathic circuits sending a message to the time lords i must tell them to i must
14737,help me off with this
14738,must lie down jo
14739,must rest for a while must rest i must rest jo
14740,now jo now listen to me im liable to sleep for quite some time now if anything happens anything at all record it in the log record it in the log
14741,yes
14742,in the log up there in the locker
14743,jo jo careful
14744,jo
14745,jo
14746,jo jo
14747,ill just have to use the emergency supply
14748,all the circuits are in order the door must be held from the outside i must get it open i must get that door open got to get the door got to get that door open
14749,thank you thank you very much how did you find me
14750,is she all right
14751,oh im sorry its just just that i thought i knew you
14752,where are you from
14753,skaro yes of course youre thals
14754,because ive been to skaro thats why
14755,oh many years ago during the dalek war
14756,yes
14757,well i can assure you that i was
14758,by travelling through the barriers of time if you must know i was with the thal group when they broke into the dalek city
14759,yes barbara ian and susan
14760,the doctor
14761,thats right
14762,now you listen to me young man you may have saved my life and im grateful but that does not give you the right to subject me to an inquisition
14763,what
14764,what are you doing
14765,now why what would have happened
14766,ah thats nice
14767,oh
14768,tell me whats the name of this planet
14769,is it inhabited
14770,any intelligent life form
14771,mmm id very much like to see one of them i mean id very much like to come into contact with one of them
14772,you said just now that you were on some sort of mission may one ask what it is
14773,as you wish im on something of a special mission myself
14774,well whatever it was you came here to do it must be pretty important
14775,how many are there of you
14776,oh only three left
14777,well you could make that four if youd let me help you five with jo grant
14778,you still dont trust me
14779,yes i see your point but i am on your side you know
14780,yes never felt better
14781,thats good
14782,understood
14783,spiridons
14784,whats this some kind of weapon
14785,daleks
14786,yes well ive had cause to this ones something new ive never come across daleks that have mastered invisibility before
14787,yes a terrifying advantage have you any idea how they do it
14788,i see
14789,no dont do that no most daleks have an automatic distress call even when theyre deactivated the transmitter may keep functioning
14790,taron seems very cautious
14791,oh who is miro
14792,oh im sorry and taron whos he
14793,oh do you think so i thought he seemed to be doing rather well
14794,well what do you think he should do
14795,how many daleks are there do you know
14796,tell me about these creatures that live here the spiridons are they invisible at all times
14797,are they working with the daleks
14798,mass exterminations followed by absolute suppression of the survivors i know
14799,fascinating
14800,mmm
14801,oh how
14802,vaber
14803,hang on just hang on i got it quickly your hand let go let it go let it go
14804,oh its all right nothing much just that some sort of tentacle tried to make a breakfast of our friend here
14805,my pleasure made an interesting little object lesson
14806,well just that it shows the need for continued caution i think
14807,theres a considerable difference between courage and reckless stupidity you know
14808,unless they change direction theyre bound to find us
14809,thank you
14810,but jo grants inside your ship ive got to do something
14811,no wait wait somebodys still in there
14812,no no
14813,jo
14814,codal so they captured you too did they
14815,well theyre all right as far as i know how are you
14816,thats good
14817,oh i expect theyre saving us for interrogation theyll want to know what were doing on this planet you know what you did back there leading the searchers away from us was very courageous
14818,oh i dont know i think youre doing yourself rather an injustice there if you hadnt acted the way you did wed have all been captured they give medals for that sort of bravery
14819,and do you think theyre any the less brave because of that
14820,well forgive me if im wrong but arent you a volunteer
14821,then you must have known what you were getting into
14822,ah you my friend you may be a very brilliant scientist but you have very little understanding of people particularly yourself courage isnt just a matter of not being frightened you know
14823,its being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway just as you did
14824,right well after that little tutorial on bravery lets see if we can find a way of getting out of here
14825,yes escape well lets take a look in our pockets and see if we can come up with something that might prove useful come on turn them out sonic screwdriver
14826,fancy hankie    jo
14827,yes thats right shed gone to fetch help for me the daleks
14828,no they murdered her  jo
14829,no thats hopeless if theres one thing the daleks are very good at making that is locks
14830,well well just have to start our escape when the doors already open
14831,yes exactly so were not trying to deal with a door were trying to deal with a dalek
14832,how thats a very good question how well there must something here that could prove useful
14833,come on come on weve got to think of something
14834,on the contrary my friend the daleks dont intend to let us rot down here you know
14835,a tiny motor with an electric power source thats it yes yes ill dismantle the circuitry reverse the polarity and convert to a low power receiver transmitter with a positive feedback
14836,correct and if we can jam them
14837,it should give them quite a brainstorm give me your screwdriver
14838,hmm
14839,no im afraid not codal you see the daleks armour acts as a sort of shield so weve got to get in very close in any case the effect will only be temporary
14840,well if were lucky long enough to get away that is if
14841,if it works
14842,oh well thats it thats the best that i can do theres only one thing we need now
14843,a dalek to try it out on
14844,come sit here now remember what i told you get in close so that it cant use its blaster right
14845,now
14846,hold on hold it
14847,had quite an effect
14848,back back
14849,back to the lift
14850,back to the lift
14851,that was close
14852,presumably thats their intention still we havent much alternative have we lets try another level
14853,thank you very much
14854,i know its not the moment to ask how you got in there but id be fascinated to know how
14855,push it up use your knife right now lever it down lever it down right now push thats it
14856,doors are closing
14857,you must pull
14858,out of here quick out come on get him out of here         dalek oc
14859,come on hurry up the doors going to close come on through come on marat marat come on marat
14860,come on marat
14861,marat
14862,right now cover your eyes         dalek 2
14863,never underestimate the daleks codal they wont let a little matter of a metal door delay them for long
14864,yes
14865,oh i dont know whether ive locked the daleks out or ourselves in
14866,well if it wasnt for the fact that it doesnt make sense id say it was a gigantic refrigeration unit
14867,yes
14868,whats this
14869,right thats it then
14870,youre probably right nevertheless it does lead up to the surface doesnt it
14871,well its pretty obvious theyd do something of the sort
14872,nothing when faced with the inevitable dont waste precious time by resisting it now what would you say the tensile strength of this material is
14873,huh thats precisely what we are going to do come with me taron i want to show you something
14874,yes exactly but if we can turn the refrigeration unit up to maximum the updraft will be hotter and even more powerful now look at this
14875,exactly and if we can trap enough of it we might be able to rise with it
14876,ive no idea we havent got much choice
14877,oh no
14878,give it time taron give it time
14879,its lifting its beginning to lift hang on tight hang on
14880,its hard to tell lets hope were high enough to be out of range
14881,miles i should think dont forget we started at the lowest level of the city should be a long slow haul
14882,you know after this i think i must take up hot air ballooning it really is most exhilarating
14883,ah cheer up my dear just you hang on tight were perfectly safe
14884,well its rate of ascent doesnt seem much faster than ours we should reach the surface before it can catch up with us
14885,the whole things going get on the side hang on
14886,right
14887,yes well i think we ought to postpone the celebrations until were in a slightly safer area come on
14888,jo
14889,jo you were on that thal spaceship i saw it destroyed
14890,but you were
14891,well its a long story and there were a few moments that were a trifle worrying
14892,you know codal and taron dont you
14893,i dont think youve met rebec
14894,yeah but
14895,yes i know that
14896,all right all right jo
14897,jo jo jo please look will you excuse us for a moment my friend has rather a lot to tell me about
14898,but jo why on earth didnt you stay in the tardis wed have been safe there
14899,on a planet full of daleks well surely i warned you
14900,did i
14901,oh im sorry jo im afraid i wasnt myself
14902,well i told them about the dalek spaceship leaving the ogron planet and told them to send the tardis after it
14903,theyve got an army based here jo the mightiest army of daleks theres ever been
14904,well evidently that was only part of their plan to make their conquest easier perhaps with an army this size we now know they intend to invade the galaxy anyway unless we can stop them
14905,and our thal friends oh dear perhaps a female shoulder to cry on might come in handy
14906,give it a try will you
14907,the load getting a little heavy
14908,oh why just because youve found out that youre not made of stone
14909,then they should have sent a machine shouldnt they
14910,good because the business of command is not for a machine is it the moment that we forget that were dealing with people then were no better off than the machines that we came here to destroy when we start acting and thinking like the daleks taron the battle is lost
14911,well done jo if those two are all right we at least have a chance
14912,then we must find shelter
14913,you know this planet never ceases to amaze me first we find a gigantic refrigerator and now night storage heaters it really sounds quite luxurious
14914,oh thats nice right lets get going jo where did you hide the bombs
14915,what are those animals
14916,thats good at least we can see them now did you notice anything peculiar about the daleks jo
14917,only that their movements seem to be slower
14918,yes but the reason the reason is the important thing
14919,yes yes of course
14920,come on jo come and keep me company
14921,what
14922,he doesnt stand a chance
14923,if thats what you want
14924,have you still got your guns with you
14925,thats good keep them handy will you look around you
14926,ive no idea but whatever they are theyre moving in closer
14927,yes but they dont stay scared for long do they
14928,well if they come in ones and twos we might manage to beat them off
14929,im going to try something
14930,well just have to hope that supply lasts till morning weve got to keep that fire going at all costs
14931,oh i was just thinking about vaber what on earth possessed him to go rushing off like that
14932,plan what plan
14933,what but thats the worse thing he could possibly do
14934,on the contrary youd be bringing their army to life
14935,no ageing process no degeneration an army of daleks in cold storage until theyre needed
14936,yes thats about it and the moment that temperature rises the dalek armys going to be on the move now weve got to find the others and warn them
14937,a spiridon
14938,you sure
14939,well please accept my thanks mister wester i owe you a very great deal
14940,except presumably the daleks
14941,well thank you for warning us well do all that we can to help you
14942,well well wait till its full light if theyre not back by then we move out without them
14943,well first of all weve got to stop the daleks releasing their bacteria second weve got to make sure their army stays inactive and third weve got to generally put an end to their chances of invasion of other planets
14944,i havent the faintest idea
14945,where on earth did you get those
14946,well done have you got the bombs
14947,now wait we cant go on running forever its time for a change of tactics
14948,no i agree so lets stop for a moment and use our intelligence shall we
14949,well to take any effective and permanent action weve got to get inside that city
14950,well i do have a plan but youll have to trust me
14951,well first of all weve got to make sure that a dalek patrol finds us somebody must go out show themselves and then lead them back here
14952,thank you latep now try and lead them around for a bit before you bring them back here well need a little time to get ourselves ready
14953,jo
14954,yes all right
14955,i noticed this this morning have you seen them before
14956,yes and hypercold yes its an odd phenomena the water on this planet it sustains subzero temperatures and yet remains semiliquid
14957,the daleks are vulnerable to extremely low temperatures and they hardly function at all at subzero levels
14958,yes its a good feeling isnt it when the hunted become the hunters
14959,good
14960,come on jo
14961,taron taron get ready
14962,well done well done everybody now come on taron weve got work to do
14963,keep out of their angle of fire they may still be dangerous right now lift up the top section are they dead
14964,right get that one up onto the bank
14965,latep youre sure you know the way to the ventilator shaft
14966,im sorry jo no it must be a twopronged attack to double our chances of success have you got the bomb whichever group gets there first must detonate that bomb in one of the tunnels near the cooling unit block off the daleks completely now whatever you do dont damage the refrigeration unit its absolutely vital that that continues to function
14967,more gentle persuasion
14968,right put it on
14969,and to you
14970,all right rebec
14971,okay
14972,presumably theyre preparing the bacteria
14973,thats wester
14974,if they open that hermetically sealed door even a fraction of an inch the bacteria will escape and destroy everything including themselves
14975,lets try and get to the lower levels
14976,the cloak come on over it    dalek 2
14977,come on come on theyre right behind you
14978,this way this way in you go
14979,out quick
14980,hes right you know one bomb wont destroy them all the most we can hope for is to stop that army getting into action
14981,i know we cant stop them but it might hold them up for a bit
14982,there you are rebec the greatest dalek invasion force ever assembled
14983,thats about it right lets go and help the others with the barricade     dalek 3
14984,that should hold them for a while rebec stay near at the slightest sound of the daleks breaking through give us plenty of warning come on you two
14985,blast i was hoping thered be a way of locking these controls into the on position as soon as this refrigeration unit is switched off those daleks will be on the move
14986,no then well have to use my other plan come on lets us know as soon as you see jo and latep
14987,well it should hold them for a little while yet now dont worry come on     dalek 2
14988,thank you taron come on we havent much time
14989,hello
14990,well it looks promising how deep is it
14991,well thats it then although it does need a bit of clearing
14992,yes the temperature has risen quite considerably
14993,in a minute theyll all be fully active come on here
14994,that should be wide enough
14995,thank you taron look ive got an idea that these catwalks lead to some sort of loading area on the surface check it out will you
14996,right get the bomb
14997,where is it
14998,can you fix it
14999,get on with it
15000,good good
15001,well this whole area is simply honeycombed with ice tunnels now a bomb put in the right place could so weaken those walls that the pressure of the ice would burst through the walls and flood this entire chamber
15002,thats the theory
15003,yes but it would centuries to melt them out
15004,well done jo
15005,taron you and the others get started well set the bomb
15006,set it to detonate in thirty seconds
15007,off you go
15008,yes of course
15009,as a matter of fact there is
15010,throughout history you thals have always been known as one of the most peace loving peoples in the galaxy
15011,yes well thats what i mean when you get back to skaro youll all be national heroes everybody will want to hear about your adventures
15012,so be careful how you tell that story will you dont glamorise it dont make war sound like an exciting and thrilling game
15013,tell them about the members of your mission that will not be returning like maro and vaber and marat tell them about the fear otherwise your people might relish the idea of war we dont want that
15014,thank you my dear well youd better get aboard i think
15015,im not sure about them goodbye rebec
15016,taron
15017,good luck
15018,if that what she wants no
15019,thank you latep
15020,come on run
15021,theyre coming now cover your face and hands as best you can come on
15022,jo look thats skaro
15023,any regrets
15024,but jo thats only one little world theres so many hundreds of others to see
15025,that one but jo thats earth
15026,home it is miss grant  ltback to the episode listing
15027,what
15028,oh no no more trouble there thank goodness i can now take the tardis wherever and whenever i like ive got absolute control over her
15029,yes exactly
15030,what this
15031,well this is the space time coordinate programmer the wretched things nearly worn out thats the trouble with the tardis shes getting on a bit you know jo
15032,theres precious little protein in an apple you know
15033,proteins the thing for breakfast jo
15034,yes thats where were going to next
15035,metebelis three the tardis cant miss this time ive actually wired the coordinates into the programmer
15036,i cant wait to go there you know jo
15037,it must be a fascinating place just imagine it a blue sun
15038,no not a green light its a blue light everythings blue there
15039,mmm absolutely
15040,you know i might even get a hold of one of those famous blue sapphires well there you are that should do it i think
15041,where are you off to
15042,oh good give me a couple of minutes and well be off
15043,well metebelis three of course
15044,why where are you thinking of going to
15045,oh jo
15046,lethbridge stewart im not a policeman neither are you for that matter
15047,then do your duty brigadier
15048,a very pretty mixed metaphor
15049,im going to metebelis three
15050,i wouldnt advise you to try
15051,metebelis three jo where else would you like to go you choose for yourself
15052,jo youve got all the time in the world and all the space im offering them to you
15053,i dont know whether to feel flattered or insulted its all right jo i understand
15054,jo
15055,tell the brigadier that ill follow him down
15056,later
15057,goodbye
15058,hello ill speak to anyone
15059,yes youre quite right brigadier nobody must go down that mine until ive had a chance to do just that
15060,we must stop them
15061,well stop winding
15062,stop winding i said
15063,what             doctor
15064,dont argue man do as i say brigadier help me
15065,yes
15066,how deep are they
15067,how deeps the shaft
15068,well can you rig a donkey engine and a pulley system if we can free the other cage we could use that
15069,well just have to risk that mind you itd mean cutting the cable
15070,oh where
15071,well thats where youre wrong
15072,do you recognise that
15073,yes precisely i found it on the floor it had been removed from the brake linkage this was no accident mister davies this was deliberate sabotage
15074,what about the west seam here can we reach them through there
15075,thats ridiculous
15076,is it indeed i hadnt realised ive been wanting to meet you for a long time your paper on dna synthesis was quite remarkable for your age
15077,no no no i mean for the age that you live in now you were about to make a suggestion i believe professor
15078,you know global chemicals is beginning to interest me tell me professor do you know the layout
15079,im quite spry for my age actually
15080,hai
15081,im afraid you have me under several disadvantages sir whom am i addressing
15082,yes and very efficient it is too if i may say so
15083,its really quite simple im attached to unit as a scientific advisor
15084,we urgently need cutting equipment at the mine you have refused to give it now my information is that it is stored in that shed over there
15085,hmm
15086,the breaking strength at this point should be something in the region of a hundred and twenty three point thirty six pounds
15087,well youre back quickly brigadier
15088,thank you yes
15089,indeed there isnt brigadier jo and the others need my help now so if mister davies and some of his colleagues would come with me
15090,dont touch him
15091,jo
15092,jo where are you
15093,couldnt wait any longer gone to find another way out jo the idiots why didnt they wait
15094,yes of course thats the west seam come on lets go after them
15095,jo can you hear me
15096,whats that light
15097,up ahead there
15098,the lights green
15099,come on what an extraordinary smell come on
15100,dave look at his hand
15101,wheres the girl
15102,take him up to the surface quickly as you can let the professor take a look at him
15103,im going on ahead to look for jo tell the brigadier that ill find her and bring her back but dont let anybody come down looking after us you understand
15104,its far too dangerous
15105,what is it
15106,we mustnt let them touch us must we now how do we get out of here
15107,lift it up right now push it over
15108,get a hold of this pole take it over that side
15109,make room for me
15110,off we go no not that way the rails blocked this way through the cave here
15111,well its only about a foot deep
15112,jo we havent got any alternative
15113,then close your eyes
15114,good girl thats it right now punt way
15115,well ive heard of boating lakes but this is ridiculous a bit more right thatll do right get rid of your pole
15116,we go up this crevice it was marked on the map
15117,well that stuff must have come down here from somewhere if theres a way down theres a way up i think i know where it leads to come on you go first
15118,if i remember rightly it gets easier further up
15119,what is it
15120,i think im beginning to understand now hold on a minute ive got to get a hold of one of those
15121,now dont knock the pit prop over youll have the whole thing down on us
15122,keep tight into the wall
15123,all right
15124,good go on
15125,right let me pass
15126,after you miss grant
15127,up you go
15128,oh its crude oil or rather crude oil waste you can see it on the sides of the pipe
15129,where else come on up you go
15130,yes i certainly can
15131,it means i think we ought to hurry come on
15132,well they must be in some way and that waste area down the mine seems to be their breeding ground
15133,where to tell stevens about us
15134,oh and which side are you on mister elgin
15135,good man
15136,good heavens what am i thinking of mister elgin can you get us out of here without us being seen
15137,and what about fell
15138,fell
15139,well the moral of story of course is never trust a venusian shanghorn with a perigosto stick
15140,thanks very much its really excellent this wine though i dont recognise the vintage
15141,can i have a bottle to take home
15142,brigadier do you want a little more wine
15143,excuse me will you
15144,thanks
15145,bad news the other miners dead
15146,yes im afraid so he never regained consciousness
15147,well theyve completed the post mortem on hughes
15148,every cell in his body had been attacked by some sort of virus apparently they still havent been able to isolate it though
15149,no not quite weve still got that egg remember
15150,yes isnt it well tomorrow morning professor jones and i are going to examine it properly
15151,well quite frankly brigadier i fail to see the value of a lot of idiot soldiers clumping about the place
15152,lethbridge stewart
15153,i think a good nights sleep is indicated jo
15154,yes well i shouldnt be too late if i were you goodnight
15155,by the way jo the tardis did come up trumps i got to metebelis three as you can see
15156,goodnight
15157,professor jones the very man ive had some thoughts about this socalled virus
15158,it seems me that if we were to postulate an active nucleus
15159,the egg it must have hatched out
15160,nancy now be careful find out where its gone and come back here at once
15161,well the others did
15162,yes and the brigadier
15163,yes
15164,thank you nancy it cant be helped well at least we can analyse this slime
15165,well
15166,well its quite simple jo were putting some of the green cells from the maggots trail with some human body cells
15167,oh jo really
15168,rather as a virus does
15169,correct jo correct
15170,well well just have to get a hold of one of those maggots wont we
15171,well i dont like the idea any more than you do jo but weve no alternative
15172,what
15173,wait wait brigadier give me an hour
15174,give me half an hour
15175,at least give me a chance to talk to the wretched man
15176,right
15177,mister stevens at the moment those maggots and their eggs are situated in one place where we can observe them now if you seal off that mine then we shall have no way of knowing
15178,oh then you dont intend to blow up the mine
15179,all im asking for is a little more time
15180,time to find out the truth time to find out if the waste from your product is causing these maggots to appear
15181,you have no such right
15182,how do you do
15183,if he does that it would be criminal folly
15184,orders is nobody capable of acting on their own around here
15185,you must stop him
15186,the best i think youll find mister yates that this is the worst days work the world has seen for many many years
15187,no
15188,yes
15189,well why didnt you tell me
15190,then why did you blow up the mine
15191,yes well i take your point brigadier but you know there are times when i do wish that your devotion to duty was a trifle more flexible shall we say
15192,the maggots are some sort of larvae and not the finished product trying to find their way to daylight
15193,thats a very good question jo
15194,no not a chance brigadier thick chitinous plates protecting the whole body surface its armour plated
15195,theres only one real answer a biological counterstrike
15196,professor jones is working on it but he needs more living tissue
15197,no wait i dont like it nobody should have to risk infection until we know we have a cure we want no more deaths
15198,can you get me any oil waste from global chemicals
15199,good
15200,let me talk to him
15201,captain yates the doctor here now look im going to have a stab at getting in there myself
15202,i see well er keep a look out for me anyway will you

15209,right come on
15210,all right captain yates what have you found out
15211,yes yes i know thats obvious but have you been able to get a hold of any of that waste
15212,well can you get a hold of the formula
15213,wheres it kept
15214,well done captain yates this could prove absolutely vital
15215,oh who
15216,oh  lovely
15217,who are you where are you
15218,why should i want to talk to a machine
15219,youre still a machine
15220,no
15221,then yes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts we are more than machines
15222,what are you then
15223,b o double s the boss
15224,ha
15225,youre still nothing but a gigantic adding machine like every other computer
15226,stevens
15227,yes infuriating isnt it
15228,today llanfairfach tomorrow the world eh
15229,a machine a megalomaniac machine but still a machine
15230,and that is
15231,whats that
15232,bombing what bombing
15233,the fool what did he want to bring them in for doesnt he realise that bombingll never stop those maggots
15234,well it wont work i tell you

15236,check
15237,go on
15238,check and mate youre nothing but a machine after all
15239,oh im not no im merely working out a few sums to keep myself from getting bored now lets see pi three point one four one six
15240,therapy oh what a pretty euphemism youre not trying to tell me this is all for my own good
15241,and that it hurts you more than it hurts me
15242,you didnt mean it to though did you
15243,nonsense sometimes it helps you know
15244,dont worry my dear fellow im having a whale of a time
15245,global chemicals taking all the profits
15246,such as a little touch of brainwashing
15247,freedom from freedom
15248,now wait boss boss now youre being illogical if you destroy me youll destroy your bargaining power after all id make a good hostage wouldnt i
15249,pleasure well well well perhaps i was wrong about you after all that last remark was worthy of a human being
15250,captain yates my dear fellow im terribly sorry

15265,what did he say
15266,serendipity
15267,what is it
15268,well ive given him a broad spectrum antibiotic that should slow the infection down no we must find an answer to those maggots before they pupate imagine thousands of flying insects spreading their infection throughout the world
15269,but why
15270,gently mike fight it
15271,no it is not necessary your orders are false do you understand me false
15272,keep quiet brigadier and keep still now mike listen to me it is necessary for me to show you something

15281,he means a lot to you doesnt he
15282,well then trust me jo im sure these injections are doing him some good

15285,well nancys gone to make some sandwiches i believe
15286,yes why dont you like it

15288,yes it could be you know i wish i knew what he meant by serendipity
15289,yes it means making a marvellous discovery by mistake i have an idea professor jones was on the point of a breakthrough
15290,yes yes i have but it doesnt say a thing take a look for yourself
15291,what have you got there sergeant
15292,its a chrysalis theyre beginning to change

15312,a happy accident
15313,jo thats it do you happen to remember which powder
15314,then come and show me quickly come on
15315,well i should have guessed its the same fungus that killed that maggot

15352,i rather gathered that when we arrived for a moment i thought they werent going to let you in
15353,makes what all the more puzzling come on brigadier you can tell me

15366,that oh that er that contains my equipment professor
15367,youre the virologist miss smith
15368,i read your paper on the teleological response of the virus a most impressive piece of work
15369,particularly when i realise you must have written it when you were five years old
15370,but youre going to try arent you
15371,mmm hmm
15372,why
15373,you realise this is a very dangerous place to be in
15374,i dont think
15375,well you can make yourself useful we need somebody around here to make the coffee
15376,professor
15377,make myself a cup of coffee good day to you
15378,no no im the doctor you really must keep your glasses on the end of your nose professor
15379,she isnt
15380,i dont think i quite understand what youre talking about professor
15381,yes he said that shes in america
15382,please be careful this is very delicate equipment
15383,shoot her
15384,thats my alarm clock
15385,its a rhondium sensor it detects delta particles at a preset spectrum density of fifteen ams it oscillates this little cylinder there which promotes a vacuum in there which wakes me up clear
15386,because im very fond of delta particles why do you ask so many questions
15387,if youll allow me to do so good night miss smith
15388,tell the brigadier what
15389,i think we can decide what to do about miss smith in the morning professor if were all still here
15390,rubeish
15391,youre asking questions again
15392,rubeish
15393,shadows
15394,i cant understand why the definition was so low unless hes operating with a very weak power source at maximum range yes of course  brigadier
15395,no professor rubeish is missing
15396,yes
15397,well i thought i saw a man in armour
15398,mmm hmm
15399,oh i very much doubt it sorry i cant stop brigadier
15400,well ive got to get on the trail while its still warm
15401,oh no he hasnt i just got a fix on him theres something very odd indeed going on
15402,someones operating a matter transmitter and the really odd thing is theres a time transference too its being worked from several centuries ago past and present mixed up very interesting that
15403,well i cant stay here chatting old boy got to get after rubeish
15404,well i got there didnt i
15405,brigadier a straight line may be the shortest distance between two points but it is by no means the most interesting goodbye old chap
15406,well done old girl absolutely on target for once
15407,how the blazes did she get here
15408,sarah miss smith come back
15409,professor morrison professor
15410,its me its the doctor dont you remember we were on the same landing at the research centre
15411,no hardly look professor whats wrong with all these people
15412,well you seem to be all right
15413,yes and very nearly blind
15414,obviously working some sort of ocular device professor have you any idea where you are
15415,yes well youre in a castle all right but do you know the time
15416,now professor listen to me this may come as a shock to you so steel yourself you have been brought back to the early years of the middle ages
15417,yes well tell me about it some other time will you weve got to get out of here before linx comes back
15418,look professor your life is in considerable danger i must insist that you
15419,professor dont you understand
15420,you know who i am
15421,to prevent your interference with the affairs of earth dont you realise the harm that youll cause
15422,thats a typically sontaran attitude
15423,thank you
15424,oh im just a tourist i like it here
15425,you havent seen it at its best
15426,once again a sontaran philosophy
15427,ah yes yes as i thought a sontaran warrior so the perpetual war between the sontarans and the rutans has spread to this tiny planet has it
15428,unfortunately
15429,gallifrey i am a time lord
15430,oh do you think so
15431,yes well youd be well advised never to put that appreciation to the test linx
15432,you seem to have acquired some help all ready
15433,from which you stole the equipment and the skilled help you couldnt find here
15434,commander linx if you will return these people to their own time i might possibly consider helping you
15435,youre interfering with human evolution linx dont you realise the damage that youre going to do to them
15436,human beings must be allowed to develop at their own pace at this period theyre just a few steps from barbarism
15437,you give them breechloading guns now theyll have atomic weapons by the seventeenth century theyll have the capability to destroy their own planet before theyre civilised enough to handle it
15438,a change of plan old chap look i want your help
15439,look behind me youll find a panel theres a switch on it
15440,right turn the switch
15441,no no thats the wrong no man
15442,yes so do i it was the wrong one
15443,yes that was the one thank you very much indeed professor
15444,smith yes of course look will you excuse me ive got to go and find a young girl ill see you later i hope
15445,ah good evening
15446,thank you very much miss smith a most timely rescue
15447,youve been getting around sarah are you on visiting terms with all the local nobility
15448,oh dear you know im afraid youre going to be awfully confused if you ask me to explain about the tardis
15449,yes my police box you were a stowaway i imagine
15450,my dear girl im not helping him linx is im trying to stop him
15451,yes perhaps youre lucky enough not to have met him yet nasty brutish and short just about sums him up
15452,yes well hed have looked even stranger if he hadnt been wearing space armour he comes from a planet where the surface gravity is many times than of earth
15453,mmm hmm
15454,because i never lie well hardly ever you ever heard of unit
15455,in an advisory capacity yes well they asked me to look into this question of the missing scientists for them
15456,my dear girl i dont go around kidnapping scientists no linx brought them here to staff his workshop now ive got to find a way of sending them back to there own time
15457,how do you do it is a pleasure and a privilege to be in the company of civilised people at last
15458,yes hes your enemy i assure you not me wed be well advised to join forces against him
15459,thats a generous admission especially coming from one of the fair sex
15460,you offer a somewhat restricted choice sir edward
15461,my services are at your disposal sir such as they are
15462,on the contrary sir i think we can
15463,yes sir with just a few men i think i can persuade irongron that we have a full garrison
15464,by creating an illusion anyway
15465,it will be sir
15466,thank you sarah
15467,i told you thered be plenty of work for everybody didnt i
15468,you dont think mixing this singularly noxious compound is fun do you hows the rest of it going
15469,excellent im glad i decided to let you stay
15470,you know i was never much of a hand with a paint brush myself
15471,no nor a palette knife for that matter but id like to study under one of the masters one day rembrandt preferably
15472,mmm hmm
15473,yes within reason
15474,because my dear sarah ive got a job to do one that involves the whole future of your species here hold this will you
15475,mmm hmm
15476,yes well the definition of the word humanity was always a rather a complex question wasnt it
15477,if you mean am i a native of the planet terra the answer is no im not
15478,me im a time lord
15479,yes thats right and my people are very keen to stamp out unlicensed time travel you can look upon them as galactic ticket inspectors if you like
15480,about what i do yes not necessarily the way i do it for example you know what this is
15481,this is my own special smoking mixture consisting of saltpetre sulphur and fat with a few little extras thrown in
15482,i thought linx would have to come along sontarans just cant resist getting involved in war
15483,hes just like a little boy stirring up the red ants and the black ants this is something to keep him amused to stop him from getting bored
15484,yes well i think wed better get back inside before that smoke rises its liable to hang around for quite some time
15485,gas good heavens what on earth do you take me for no it was some sort of superior stink bomb with a few bangs and flashes thrown in for good measure no its quite harmless i assure you but  phew
15486,no thank you no oh well just perhaps just a little
15487,well we all played our part sir edward
15488,not quite im afraid
15489,it wont work indefinitely i fear this time we had the element of surprise they wont be frightened off quite so easily again
15490,well theres one sure way to prevent irongron from capturing your castle
15491,you must capture his
15492,my lady are you familiar with these herbs and simples
15493,excellent i want to brew up a little draught
15494,no no not quite just something to calm him down a little
15495,we come to beg alms of the good captain irongron the fame of his charity is spread far and wide
15496,heaven will reward you my son come brother
15497,right lets take a look in linxs workshop
15498,deep hypnosis
15499,yes well im very glad we didnt in a few hours that ships going to be ready for takeoff
15500,im not surprised hes suffering from near starvation
15501,theres no time for that
15502,sarah listen to me linxs spaceship is just about ready for take off and if that happens theres going to be the most tremendous explosion everybody in this castle will die
15503,trying to break this hypnosis
15504,the brain can still receive signals professor it might work
15505,dont you want to get back to the twentieth century
15506,if i can get these people to respond i can send them back to their own time with linxs osmic projector
15507,yes its over there on the table take a look
15508,its too risky with their minds in this state the transition might damage them permanently
15509,polka time
15510,hide
15511,leave him linx
15512,well dont you want to know why i returned
15513,i came here to offer you my help
15514,because i want something from you if you will let me dehypnotise people and send them home and help me capture irongron and his men then i will assist you in the repairs to your spaceship now the weapons that youve made for irongron you can leave here in the castle and when its empty you can take off destroying castle and weapons at the same time all right commander linx what do you say
15515,i do
15516,linx cant you see that your prisoners are physically exhausted theyve had no sleep and nothing to eat for days
15517,not for much longer
15518,thats such an old tune dont you know theres no such thing as the super race
15519,every species has its own weakness linx for instance you can only be stunned by a blow on the probic vent that small hole at the back of your neck
15520,well done rubeish
15521,yes yes the blast was too brief but i wouldnt have been in a few moments thank you very much sarah
15522,yes all right but be careful
15523,right well if we can secure our friend here we can get on with the job of restoring his wretched victims
15524,rubeish youre invaluable my dear chap
15525,well that should hold him for a while even on this planet
15526,well in his own environment he weighs several tons fortunately his muscles have been designed for load bearing rather than leverage
15527,who speaks
15528,tell him im busy
15529,well i wouldnt recommend him for the royal society all right rubeish old chap now you know how to bring these people round
15530,yes quite so ill leave you to get on with it
15531,i was going to preset this osmic projector and send these people back to their own time but now i have to find a way of stalling irongron
15532,i am a gift to captain irongron from the one who made me my master commander linx
15533,my master toils in his workshop to make you more fighting robots he sent me as proof of his goodwill
15534,now i must return
15535,that is my purpose
15536,i was programmed to fight for you not against you
15537,you will damage my circuits
15538,isnt that a bit unsporting old man i mean sitting ducks and all that
15539,i cannot reveal my face irongron
15540,because if i did it might give you a seizure
15541,well i did warn you didnt i
15542,thank you sir for your charm and old world courtesy may i ask the purpose of this tomfoolery if youre going to have me shot why dont you get on with it
15543,nothing that i do will be of use to you irongron
15544,im in no great hurry i assure you
15545,well done sarah just like a daring young man on the flying trapeze come on  irongron
15546,oh wait a bit give the potion time to work and then go back
15547,sarah i must rubeish and all those scientists are there now linxs spaceship is just about ready for takeoff and when that happens therell be a tremendous explosion and all that will be left of that castle will be a pile of stones
15548,just believe me sir when linx goes it goes
15549,there are innocent people in that castle my lady and i dont like the idea of anybody going up in smoke not even irongron
15550,well thank you thank you both i can do with all the help i can get
15551,good evening
15552,good well well wait a bit to be on the safe side and then well go in
15553,yes so i see wheres linx
15554,wheres the osmic projector it was over there on the table
15555,well ill just have to take it out again wont i hal scout around the castle see if irongron and his men are sleeping if they are disarm them and come back here
15556,get the osmic projector fortunately its an independent unit
15557,well i can try
15558,then weve got between five and ten minutes to get out of here before were all blown to kingdom come
15559,no the drive system is sealed linx must have taken the activator key i managed to get a hold of this though i was lucky to get it out with the drive running i think that should do it
15560,all right rubeish come over here i may want you to take over now then all you have to do is this this and this get it
15561,right here goes
15562,thats linx send the rest of them back ill try and keep him busy
15563,somethings gone wrong he must have hit the take off button too soon come on weve got about a minute to get out of here quick run
15564,im sorry im afraid we must be off goodbye hal
15565,to tell you the truth hal im not a magician at all
15566,well i told you id get you back home safely didnt i
15567,well theres no point in going back there no i set course for unit hq
15568,the space time coordinates were a bit out thats all we cant be far away
15569,somewhere in london
15570,well when we left give or take a few weeks
15571,my dear sarah you are perfectly safe now all weve got to do now is go and find a telephone and ring the brigadier
15572,well the parks departments cutting down some trees come on
15573,thats a very unfair word you know because actually the vandals were quite decent chaps come on lets see if we can go and find a taxi
15574,yes
15575,theres no anything no nothings moving no bicycles no pedestrians no cars nothing
15576,well perhaps its sunday great britain always closes on sundays come on i think wed better walk
15577,well perhaps he doesnt like hitchhikers
15578,do as he says sarah sarah do as he says look i realise that youre very busy but would you mind telling me whats going on around here
15579,sarah no hes liable to shoot you out of pure terror
15580,listen
15581,its stopping come on
15582,not really no help me up will you
15583,get out come on in the back
15584,will you please tell me whats happening
15585,look will you please tell me whats going on here
15586,now if i can have a word with someone in authority
15587,doctor john smith no relation
15588,youd never believe me
15589,come on sarah lets go and have our photos taken shall we
15590,oh all right
15591,now what about one of both of us come and join in
15592,no wed rather stand if you dont mind
15593,oh what a good idea there we are
15594,wait for the officer to turn up maybe we can get some sense out of him
15595,ive no idea maybe this gentleman here can enlighten us
15596,yes
15597,no do you
15598,no thank you very much
15599,we do have names you know
15600,now just one moment
15601,sir i am the scientific advisor to unit and i demand to be put in immediate touch with brigadier lethbridge stewart
15602,yes as a matter of fact he is
15603,tell me my friend what was that idea that you had about escaping
15604,oh i think we can be a bit more original than that cant we
15605,we have a fight
15606,youre the nark arent ya it was you wot grassed on us
15607,yes you did come on on your feet come on up
15608,steady
15609,never mind that now come on lets get out of here
15610,oh so much for honour amongst thieves hai
15611,a piece of wire to jump the ignition ill try in the back
15612,and how was i to know it was detention centre transport
15613,a tyrannosaurus rex the largest and fiercest predator of all time
15614,yes sixty five million years ago to be precise
15615,sorry
15616,because those soldiers were talking about the central zone werent they
15617,thats a very good question sarah
15618,what producing a sweet little baby monster
15619,perhaps somebody kept it as a pet and turned it out when it got too big to feed
15620,anyway arent you forgetting that pterodactyl that attacked us in the warehouse
15621,yes as a matter of fact i think i have
15622,wizard im no wizard i assure you youve got no need to be frightened of me
15623,how did you get here
15624,yes yes of course look do you know what year it is
15625,i only wish i could
15626,im afraid i dont have that power
15627,fascinating absolutely fascinating that was a time eddy for a moment there time went backwards
15628,can you bolt that door
15629,hide
15630,how many of these things have been seen up to now
15631,well thats absolutely marvellous brigadier now whatre you doing about the real problem
15632,well having contained them what do you do then
15633,well thats pretty obvious isnt it sarah
15634,back where they came from into the past
15635,mike my dear fellow how are you good to see you again
15636,certainly
15637,you can ask but i dont guarantee that youll get a reply
15638,oh is he indeed how do you do general
15639,somebody or something is operating a temporal displacement on a very vast scale
15640,the creatures are being brought from the past into the present general staying here for a while and then returning to their own time
15641,i take it then that you have a better theory
15642,er miss smith is presently acting as my assistant general you were saying my dear
15643,youll do no such thing brigadier
15644,general we need to study this creature not shoot at it how much do you think well learn from a dead dinosaur come on brigadier i want you to take me down there right away
15645,good grief its a stegosaurus what a splendid specimen no no dont shoot i want to take a good look at it
15646,dont worry brigadier its a vegetarian
15647,right well need some rope and a strong net
15648,yes of course i want to observe it under laboratory conditions have you got any rope
15649,thats my intention yes
15650,that creature has an amiable disposition brigadier and a brain about the size of a walnut i think we should be able to deal with it dont you
15651,its all right corporal dont bother
15652,no sir
15653,yes general finch that is precisely what happened
15654,the brigadier and his men couldnt see what happened sir they were temporally affected by a time eddy
15655,whenever a creature appears or disappears the temporal displacement causes a localised distortion in time now as far as the people in the immediate vicinity were concerned time literally runs backwards so naturally theyd have no recollection of what had occurred
15656,well we must capture one of the creatures
15657,well i think a study of one of these dinosaurs general might lead me to the source
15658,then why are they contained to this one area these giant reptiles existed all over the planet mike theyd be popping up everywhere
15659,well i think he was an accident whoevers responsible for these apparitions general is operating from somewhere in this area
15660,well thats where youre wrong mike someones there and whoever it is is using vast amounts of power
15661,then someone brigadier is making their own
15662,naturally
15663,by a simple molecular reaction
15664,i doubt it the principle hasnt really been developed on earth yet
15665,well itll temporarily neutralise creatures brain cells
15666,all animals have brains of some sort mike
15667,itll faint
15668,surround it with an electrical field and wait for it to disappear
15669,well the source of the power that is moving these creatures through time
15670,mmm pretty accurate enough for the brigadier and his merry men to round up the guilty parties anyway
15671,yes that would be helpful
15672,oh no look ask captain yates theres a good girl
15673,hmm yes yes anything you like
15674,i didnt
15675,no
15676,well there is
15677,go away
15678,yeah im sure hed enjoy that
15679,oh no
15680,well im glad somebody does
15681,yes i sincerely hope so arent you the chap who started the save planet earth society
15682,you also wrote that book last chance for man didnt you
15683,oh my dear grover im delighted to meet you this planet needs people like you
15684,oh nonsense nonsense no need to rush away come over here let me explain to you what im doing now then in the first place
15685,i think it will all we need now is a dinosaur to try it out on
15686,yes i believe these dinosaurs are being used purely as a terror weapon in order to clear central london
15687,well presumably so that some vast project can be carried out something for which people will get in the way
15688,why indeed well there must be some overriding reason there must be something that they need thats only available to them here
15689,any idea what kind it is
15690,apatosaurus commonly known as the brontosaurus large placid and stupid thats exactly what we need
15691,will you excuse us minister ill let you know as soon as weve captured it come on brigadier
15692,jolly good right lets go and take a look at it
15693,the bigger the better brigadier
15694,the larger the mass the greater the temporal displacement for my instruments to measure
15695,then i shall simply turn round and come back feeling rather foolish
15696,not unless its roused captain yates mind you i wouldnt like to try it on a tyrannosaurus rex
15697,that wont be necessary
15698,yes i think so mind you that creature isnt what i wanted at all what i really wanted was a brontosaurus
15699,the difference brigadier is that the brontosaurus is a placid vegetarian whereas the tyrannosaurus is the largest and fiercest flesh eater ever known on your planet
15700,yes for a while
15701,we sit back and wait for it to dematerialise
15702,carry on sarah im all ears
15703,you should have come to me i know all about time travel
15704,oh are there any
15705,oh fascinating the trouble is the blinovitch limitation effect if they could overcome that their problems
15706,what on this planet
15707,oh yes yes of course er lets see now there was this this chinese scientist called chun sen oh hang about he hasnt been born yet has he
15708,oh why
15709,has he indeed
15710,and you think he could be behind all this
15711,you could be right sarah its worth checking up on
15712,yeah id like to see the application for that grant see the mans working papers
15713,oh brigadier have your fellows brought the tardis back to unit hq for me yet
15714,could you give me a run down there
15715,good thanks theres one or two things inside i think i might need
15716,oh hell be all right for a while youve placed guards
15717,good
15718,then my instruments will obtain the necessary readings coming
15719,have you sir
15720,so youve seen his working papers
15721,so you dont think that he could be behind whats been happening here
15722,yeah well its a possibility minister but i cant guarantee it
15723,thats a good idea
15724,what a charming fellow you know its lucky for you brigadier that somebody with some sense is in charge of this operation
15725,yes quite wheres sarah
15726,huh didnt look like the beginnings of a beautiful friendship to me oh by the way brigadier ive got to get down to the hanger could you lend me a jeep
15727,oh
15728,come on up come on come on get up thats it
15729,shes right you know brigadier that door was bolted on the outside
15730,thanks sergeant put it down there will you when the creature vanished it was still in the electrical forcefield brigadier so we should learn something
15731,and this machines been sabotaged theres not a single reading
15732,well at least weve learnt something brigadier somebody inside this organisation is working against us
15733,it was a deliberate attempt on sarahs life
15734,yes i shall build another detector
15735,no no no this time im going to try something different im going to build a portable device to detect that power source
15736,because brigadier it cannot be as accurate or as powerful as this would have been but it could give us the general direction
15737,oh something like a small nuclear generator
15738,no hes right you know sarah it is pretty unlikely isnt it look why dont you try and get some rest
15739,right ill be getting on with it
15740,sergeant sergeant benton
15741,look ill need some more electronic equipment can you organise it
15742,ah thanks very much hows miss smith
15743,er did you give her somewhere to rest
15744,oh where
15745,you know sometimes that girl baffles me
15746,nothing has been achieved general finch because of sabotage now the chains holding the tyrannosaurus were deliberately severed and somebody attempted to murder miss smith by locking her in the hanger with the creature
15747,not a bit of it brigadier this new car of mine is exactly what i need speed is of the essence you know
15748,right
15749,mind the steps brigadier right now its through here
15750,well it was there but now it seems to have gone
15751,sure of course im sure
15752,oh what about
15753,and had it
15754,youll forgive me minister if i prefer to believe the evidence of my own eyes where did miss smith go to after she visited you
15755,are you quite certain
15756,thank you sir
15757,are you quite sure of that
15758,grover was covering up because hes implicated himself
15759,the monsters are a sideissue brigadier a device to clear central london no some vast scheme is underway im sure of it and its rapidly moving towards its climax
15760,get back to that underground station with explosives
15761,then get it
15762,who is it
15763,hello     doctor
15764,whitaker the man with the time travel theories tell me are you responsible for these apparitions
15765,well look can you get down to unit headquarters its in a ma  whitaker
15766,yes all right ill be with you as soon as i can goodbye
15767,yes and no doubt hell be very pleased to hear it since he arranged the whole thing
15768,oh thats just what you want isnt it my silence
15769,yes well now that youve caught me general you can end the evacuation and return your eight million londoners cant you
15770,now listen to me mike we havent got much time i want you to raise all the men you can muster and some kind of high explosive now ive got a pretty good idea where their base is
15771,so it was you mike
15772,captain yates is the man inside whos working against us
15773,im afraid its true
15774,what indeed
15775,what
15776,thank you sergeant benton
15777,hello tango one patrol here its all right weve got him yeah were bringing him in now listen inform all the other units will you over  pilot
15778,look face up to it brigadier general finch is involved just like grover
15779,well captain yates certainly is
15780,hmm theres a note here from sarah there you are yes she says shes got positive proof of grovers involvement and the existence of the underground base here see for yourself
15781,er private when was this note left
15782,thank you
15783,theres no time for that
15784,yes attack that underground base now
15785,just what are they going to do mike
15786,roll back time i see can whitaker really do that
15787,do you realise whatll happen if they succeed
15788,there never was a golden age mike its all an illusion
15789,whitakers machine creates a protective field and anyone within that field will be unaffected anybody outside it will just cease to exist
15790,now listen to me mike
15791,yes there is take the world that youve got and try and make something of it its not too late
15792,thank you sergeant
15793,we cant wait
15794,that projects going to be activated any moment now and when that happens your reinforcements will vanish and so will you
15795,thank you
15796,hang on to your hat brigadier
15797,well dont worry brigadier im never wrong if we dont get down there there wont be a london transport to explain to
15798,good grief its a triceratops look brigadier try and keep it occupied while im finishing this off will you dont worry theyre none too bright
15799,yes yes nearly ready come on
15800,no id rather go on my own its less conspicuous you go and get those reinforcements will you
15801,on the contrary im just in time to prevent an atrocity
15802,keep back
15803,back to their golden age and i hope they like it
15804,it was for the world outside the forcefield your time was just frozen for a few seconds
15805,quite
15806,yes well of course he was mad but at least he realised the dangers this planet of yours is in brigadier the danger of it becoming one vast garbage dump inhabited only by rats
15807,its not the the oil and the filth and the poisonous chemicals that are the real cause of pollution brigadier its simply greed
15808,poor mike
15809,well there you are sarah i told you id get you home safely didnt i
15810,well its not my fault if people get up to no good while we were away
15811,oh its a pity that
15812,well er i was rather thinking of making a trip to florana
15813,florana probably one of the most beautiful planets in the universe
15814,its always carpeted with perfumed flowers
15815,and its seas are as warm milk and the sands as soft as swans down
15816,the streams flow with water that are clearer than the clearest crystal
15817,oh i do like to be beside the seaside i do like to be beside the sea
15818,well you wont need those for a start
15819,you cant sink on florana
15820,the waters effervescent the bubbles support you
15821,all right but you wait until youve seen florana i always come back from florana feeling a hundred years younger
15822,and the beauty of it all is
15823,we seem to have got a mains power
15824,im not sure ill cut in the emergency units
15825,oh there you are well one things certain weve landed
15826,sarah the scanner quickly there could be enough charge to operate it
15827,only fog fascinating isnt it
15828,well perhaps thats whats put the tardis out of action
15829,yes of course
15830,hardly listen
15831,yes exactly not a click not a tick nothing the tardis is a living thing thousands of instruments its energy sources never stop
15832,sarah theres a torch in that cabinet get it for me will you
15833,good
15834,well dont worry ive got an oil lamp in here that should be all right yes there it is
15835,on the contrary im going to light it and illumine us
15836,there we are
15837,well well have to get it adjusted thats better right now lets see where we are
15838,here hold this for a minute will you normally this door is power operated well have to work it by hand wheres that crank handle there it is
15839,now bring the light over here please
15840,good right thats enough
15841,well this is no ordinary fog
15842,it must be perfectly obvious to you sarah that weve gone ever so slightly astray so sarcasm of that
15843,ah its all right its just rock
15844,no some sort of life form that has become petrified i should think
15845,no i doubt if anything has grown here for centuries
15846,well if the rest of the planets like this then life here certainly doesnt depend on photosynthesis
15847,some power emanating from this planet has stopped the tardiss energy banks now logically that power can hardly be of geological origin
15848,yes exactly
15849,im sorry im afraid we cant fix it not unless we discover the source of the power thats blocking us
15850,ive no idea
15851,until we can discover the source of that energy loss yes
15852,well i think to begin with we must check the immediate area dont you
15853,oh for heavens sake girl go and put something warm on
15854,what happened to him
15855,in a roundabout sort of way yes
15856,well it would have saved me a few bruises if wed shaken hands the first time wed met hello how do you do
15857,lieutenant are you a military expedition
15858,master of science
15859,back to the tardis thats my spaceship i have a young companion with me sarah jane smith i only hope she had the good sense to stay inside after i was captured
15860,its not far from here
15861,yes if sarahs rather headstrong by now i expect shes out looking for me
15862,what forbidden city
15863,well what is this place where is it
15864,tell me whats the purpose of your expedition
15865,parrinium
15866,well forgive me but what do you want it for
15867,well here and there one place and another well i am a little out of touch ill admit
15868,and parrinium will halt this disease
15869,i see
15870,do you happen to know if that message was received
15871,i think we can safely assume that no help is coming so might i make a suggestion
15872,well know soon enough
15873,daleks
15874,well well well daleks without the power to kill how does it feel
15875,and if i dont what will you do your weapons are totally useless affected by the same energy blackout that has stranded us  dalek 2
15876,well they may agree with your plan captain but i advise you dont trust them
15877,theyre brilliant technicians it was their inventive genius that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe remember that
15878,well whatever theyre going to do i hope they decide quickly
15879,i think theyll go for it mind you they havent much choice but i must warn you again dont you trust them an inch
15880,yes several of the planets the daleks have colonised are suffering from the same disease theyre dying in millions now they need that chemical just as badly as you do thats why i think theyll cooperate    dalek 2
15881,well have you decided
15882,a very wise decision
15883,take cover
15884,its no good we cant help him
15885,quick come on out come on
15886,down
15887,just a suggestion thats all
15888,so it was a large group
15889,whats going on over there
15890,certainly when the only alternative to living is dying all right come on lets get it over with
15891,sarah what are you doing with her
15892,i have a feeling it might be better if you did not associate yourself too closely with us i think were the flies in a jar of very nasty ointment
15893,well im afraid that what they had planned for you has merely been postponed i think theyll be two of us in the next performance
15894,no thats pure wishful thinking jill the daleks wont give us any loyalty and i dont expect too much help from your space chums either
15895,right come on jump jump
15896,hardly theyre probably the most technically advanced and ruthless life form in the galaxy
15897,because theyre only half robot sarah inside each of those shells is a living bubbling lump of hate
15898,no they move by psychokinetic power
15899,do you
15900,well that seemed to be the general idea yes
15901,yes i knew that thought would occur to you sooner or later
15902,yes and its not one of my favourites in fact i dont care for it at all
15903,oh very well i think they expect that sacrifice to be completed by something else something that lives down this tunnel
15904,yes some sort of subterranean wind effect i should think
15905,myself chiefly
15906,i think ill make a short reconnaissance down this tunnel here alone
15907,look sarah i dont want anything creeping down behind me and blocking off my retreat now do i with you here on watch you can give me a warning
15908,youre in a perfectly safe place here youve got three different ways to run
15909,i think ill just go down it for about half a mile if it holds any promise ill be right back all right
15910,thank you
15911,oh good shot sir
15912,all right all right all right all right all right just a moment just a moment ive just had a face to face confrontation with a rather nasty root it obviously wasnt very fond of me but it positively hated the dalek
15913,yes it must have been one of those sort of underground support systems for the city i should imagine
15914,the root one
15915,dalek nil in fact this was about the only part of it that was left undamaged
15916,sarah who are your shining friends
15917,you first go on sarah
15918,i really must go on a diet one of these days give me your hand
15919,come on
15920,its all right he seems to have gone is anyone hurt
15921,we cant sit around underground forever there are things we must do
15922,well get the power back into our spaceships for one thing and for another do everything we can to help that earth mission ship
15923,you take it from me sarah the moment they cease to be of use to the daleks theyll wipe them out without a qualm
15924,what destroyed their power war
15925,i see so the city became an entity though greater and more powerful than the many small parts that had created it
15926,yet you dont fear the city bellal why
15927,yes well i think the time has come to do something about this city
15928,you say that markings like these are cut into the walls of the city
15929,no not fully but i do have a rough idea of what theyre intended to convey you see ive seen them before
15930,on the walls of a temple in peru
15931,yeah thats what they said about the peruvian temple as well yes its one of earths great mysteries that no primitive man could possibly have built such a structure well now weve solved it
15932,you say that your ancestors were travelling in space when other worlds were still primitive
15933,then they almost certainly visited earth and taught the people there how to build
15934,yes they must drain their electrical energy from the atmosphere probably via that beacon
15935,well you seem to have a crude grasp of the general idea yes
15936,another of our dalek friends has had root trouble
15937,well now that must be one of the seven hundred wonders of the universe
15938,im afraid youre not going any closer
15939,ive got something far more important for you to do
15940,sarah if that earth rocket doesnt get away from here millions of people are going to die
15941,i want you to make galloway and his friends understand theyve got to get the parrinium aboard that ship and be ready for blast off the moment the power is restored now remember the daleks will be fully powered too and theyll do everything they can to destroy the earth ship
15942,yes im certain of it i know the daleks and theyre not medical missionaries
15943,good girl youll take care of yourself wont you
15944,theres just one more thing if i dont come back
15945,you must go with them
15946,touch sensitised thats brilliant
15947,yes
15948,yes its difficult very difficult
15949,vaguely but
15950,i think i have something here these symbols dont conform
15951,where
15952,well i simply picked out the symbol that appeared to be different and traced its outline on the wall
15953,well i cant think what else
15954,i should think that is extremely unlikely he didnt get out again did he
15955,no no no that doesnt just make sense
15956,yes thats right they got this far then they couldnt pass the next intelligence test
15957,im not sure yet logically there must be one
15958,oh no no its much more than that its a maze a test of skill and logic that we have to pass before we can move deeper into the city
15959,well then we shall simply add to these decorations
15960,yes i think weve got it i think this is it bellal yes thats it
15961,stop dont move
15962,no neither do i
15963,oh yes i think so let me show you something
15964,dont be too sure
15965,yes its bloodstream rather than its stomach were being moved around like     doctor
15966,no no well have to start all over again try in that corner will you theres a good chap
15967,yes well whatever it is we seem to have qualified for the next test do you feel ready to go on
15968,yes come on old chap
15969,we must be getting very close to the centre of the city by now
15970,i shouldnt be too sure have you any idea why the city should be testing us in this way    doctor
15971,well if im right the ultimate test will be an assault on our sanity so be ready for it
15972,fight it its an illusion its an illusion you have no substance no truth you do not exist you do not exist
15973,our entrance must have created a current of air which broke the surface tension
15974,the brain and the nervous system that weve go to destroy
15975,i think i know a way
15976,what is it
15977,what is it
15978,we havent got much time
15979,the city is creating antibodies theyre trying to neutralise us now keep a very close eye on them let me know the moment theyre complete
15980,yes all right ive nearly finished
15981,psychological warfare im trying to destroy the citys brain engineer what in human terms is called a nervous breakdown
15982,the computer is a machine of logic bellal it cannot stand paradoxes    dalek 2
15983,it should be safe now come on       dalek 2
15984,the controls are beginning to break down its working come on
15985,theyre getting ready to leave
15986,yes i know the daleks and theyll cause the maximum havoc and destruction before they go
15987,its their scorched planet policy
15988,shush how did it go
15989,good
15990,well thats not going to be so easy come over here and see for yourself come on look
15991,well dont prolong the agony its obvious you mean to kill us why dont you get on with it
15992,well what had you in mind
15993,i imagine the daleks have already taken that into account peter
15994,come on get out of here quick or well be caught in the exhaust blast come on out come on quick move
15995,what do you mean
15996,well he did his duty now you must do yours get that parrinium to where its needed
15997,its rather a pity in a way now the universe is down to six hundred and ninety nine wonders  ltback to the episode listing
15998,the citadel of peladon sarah one of the most interesting and
15999,well no not exactly
16000,yes well with the scanner still on the blink there was no way i could really check
16001,come on lets go and see where we are
16002,yes yes the citadel is built on a mountain you see and the mountain is honeycombed with tunnels like this come on
16003,oh have a heart sarah ive been meaning to pay a return visit to peladon for ages
16004,come along sarah jane
16005,this way i think
16006,mislaid possibly
16007,for two good reasons one that i dont want to leave peladon without having a word with my good friend the king
16008,and second
16009,we are lost come on
16010,cheer up sarah were nearly there i recognise this tunnel
16011,thatll be the palace guard well be all right now
16012,sarah sarah
16013,oh no were not look
16014,there must have been a misunderstanding probably startled
16015,ah look at old aggedor there he is bless him
16016,ah thats just a statue you wait till youve seen the real animal
16017,yes didnt i tell you about my first visit to peladon
16018,well peladon was just on the point of entering the galactic federation you see when suddenly they started having this trouble
16019,oh well of course if you dont want to hear about it
16020,dont worry sarah as soon as king peladon turns up
16021,may i first know whom i have the honour of addressing
16022,your majesty but er where is king peladon
16023,oh i see that explains a great deal
16024,yes yes in a moment old chap your majesty
16025,you really are a suspicious fellow arent you
16026,the answer to all our troubles sarah
16027,alpha centauri
16028,alpha centauri my dear fellow what a very welltimed entrance
16029,neither have you my dear fellow a touch of grey around the tentacles perhaps but still the same old alpha
16030,sarah sarah
16031,oh i thought that would rankle a bit
16032,actually you owe alpha centauri a very great deal of gratitude without him youd have been lucky to have got out of there alive they go in for rough justice here on peladon you know chop off your head and apologise afterwards
16033,yes thats a point
16034,well it seems to me eckersley the federation has brought a lot of its troubles on itself
16035,look its fifty years now since peladon joined the galactic federation and what have the miners got to show for it harder work for the same rewards
16036,yes well thats another thing that concerns me this war i thought the federation was dedicated to peace
16037,have you tried to negotiate
16038,its possible i suppose
16039,i think youll find that they are
16040,when miners have to take up arms to protect their rights they probably have their reasons id like to know what those reasons are
16041,right then lets see what he has to say to queen thalira come on you two stay here
16042,not all of them your majesty
16043,you really are remarkably ungrateful arent you
16044,ive just saved you from a serious political mistake may i address your majesty
16045,your majesty as you know the miners are already on the point of armed rebellion how would they react if their leader was killed by the queens guards hed become a martyr a figurehead for a peoples revolution revolution and civil war your majesty unless you allow me to help you
16046,by proving my belief that the appearances of aggedor are caused by trickery
16047,thank you your majesty id like to begin by inspecting where aggedor last appeared so if someone could show me the way
16048,yes splendid well after you old chap
16049,oh so this is it is it all right lets take a look inside
16050,very high grade too and you say the light that killed vega nexos came from in here
16051,blor are you all right come on up you get thats it
16052,yes well something killed him poor chap and it would have killed me too if you hadnt come to the rescue
16053,wait i think i can help you if youll let me
16054,for the good of peladon you see i have a special interest in this planet
16055,well find out whos using aggedor to frighten your miners for one thing
16056,possibly but if you can persuade your miners to go back to work i think i can persuade the federation to improve conditions now and not wait until the war is over
16057,exactly and thats just what somebody wants now do you think its just a coincidence that aggedor appeared in that cave just as i started my investigations
16058,yes well i dont believe all that i think the aggedor that weve seen is nothing but technological trickery
16059,i dont know but im determined to find out
16060,nothing we dont want any more idiotic tricks like that attack on the armoury
16061,you didnt stand a chance those armoury doors are electronically controlled from the communications room now that sort of thing just gets people killed for nothing now please all of you just sit tight and give me a chance to work things out hmm
16062,thank you gebek
16063,splendid now id like to have a talk to queen thalira preferably without ortron breathing down the back of my neck
16064,ortron doesnt give up easily does he can we lose him
16065,come on
16066,yes dont worry about me old chap i think i know my way from now on good luck
16067,do forgive me old chap but youve got it all wrong
16068,yes well i very nearly was
16069,yes i know ive just met him in the tunnels
16070,my dear chap youre just not listening are you no ones admitting anything but if youll take my advice youll try and get on the right side of gebek without him youve got a full scale revolution on your hands
16071,look just take me to the queen theres a good chap
16072,both
16073,dont be a fool
16074,are you all right sarah
16075,no i think theres more to it than that
16076,yes i know now dont move sarah
16077,come on aggedor old chap thats no way to greet an old friend
16078,i dont believe this he and i used to be the greatest of friends aggedor aggedor yes of course
16079,a little bit of light hypnosis it brings out his sweeter nature doesnt it old chap hmm come and tickle his ears sarah
16080,well as we were shoved down here to receive the verdict of aggedor i would say that the result is very much in our favour wouldnt you come on aggedor old chap here we go
16081,well not at all your majesty in fact i was delighted to meet aggedor again
16082,thank you
16083,that the miners are on the point of armed rebellion your majesty and that gebek is your only hope hes a moderate civil wars the last thing that he wants
16084,yes thats the trouble ettis has scored a considerable success with that attack of his on the armoury now all the young hotheads are keen to follow him
16085,send for gebek at once your majesty promise him a better way of life for his miners and see that they get it that will cut the ground from under ettis feet
16086,youve got to convince your people that the federation means a better way of life for everybody not just for a few nobles at court
16087,ill do my best your majesty
16088,thank you your majesty
16089,ill just have quick word with the ambassador and then ill be off sarah why dont you er why dont you stay and have a few words with the queen i have an idea you could give her some good advice
16090,what on peladon possessed you to do a thing like that
16091,yes well eckersley should have had more sense
16092,yes in a minute sarah sending for federation troops is the one thing that is certain to make things worse well i only hope i can get things sorted out before they arrive
16093,yes
16094,yes and a very considerable power source too
16095,yes well its certainly worth investigating but first ive got to contact gebek
16096,oh come on ortron get out of my way
16097,right ill be off
16098,bye
16099,youre making a very grave mistake ortron
16100,guard guard could i have a glass of water please
16101,ah my glass of water at last eh
16102,well done get his keys
16103,give me the keys
16104,thatll have to wait for a while ortrons on the warpath
16105,id like you to take me to the federation refinery from what sarah tells me theres something singularly suspicious going on down there
16106,well i believe you gebek thats why weve got to expose this aggedor trickery before they arrive what is it
16107,yes quite so old chap but still weve got to think of first things first eh come on lets get on      voice
16108,what
16109,yes well dont worry old chap its eckersleys patent alarm system ill deal with the magic before we start
16110,yes yes stop worrying ive just got one more connection to make
16111,that should do it it should open now
16112,an excellent summing up commander azaxyr do you know youd have made a very good judge
16113,yes but its the situation on peladon that is stopping you getting the trisilicate
16114,that was different
16115,commander azaxyr supposing these terror methods of yours dont work what then
16116,do you see how they unite against you commander its no easy job holding down a hostile planet
16117,i just wanted you to see what you were up against thank you commander azaxyr
16118,dont i even get a trial
16119,then i think youd be very foolish to destroy the one person who could help you
16120,yes thats right gebek is the key and i happen to be the only man that he trusts
16121,thats the professional attitude for you sarah
16122,and leave all our friends in the lurch in any case commander azaxyr would never let us reach the tardis even if we knew where it was
16123,er sarah you remember the first time that you went down to the refinery
16124,you told me that you saw something
16125,well er go and take a close look at sskel
16126,the ice warrior
16127,no sarah is absolutely right those two were in the refinery all the time
16128,because commander azaxyr isnt acting on behalf of the federation at all hes up to something on his own
16129,yes thats right  right well i must go and contact gebek
16130,now come on sskel you heard what the commander said im to go and see gebek and get him to persuade his miners to go back to work now he cant talk to them unless i talk to him can he
16131,wait there sskel i wont be a moment
16132,your majesty now listen to me gebek we havent got much time i want your miners to cooperate by going back to work
16133,well its nice to see the peladonians all on the same side for once  i dont mean really cooperate i want the miners to pretend to cooperate to give us time to deal with the ice warriors
16134,then youll have to make them understand wont you forgive us your majesty come on we havent got much time sskel
16135,i take it my death sentence has been lifted then
16136,well thats something i suppose
16137,oh but of course ive always been very keen on survival
16138,so much for stage one now for stage two i think
16139,my dear sarah azaxyr will kill me anyway as soon as he finds im no longer useful its just a question of my getting rid of him before he gets rid of me
16140,warm things up a little one thing ice warriors cant stand is heat
16141,i think things should be heating up nicely now
16142,well if they dont get out of the mines theyll get groggier and groggier until
16143,right
16144,right its time we were going i think
16145,wont be very safe up here once commander azaxyr finds out what weve been up to
16146,well lead a party of pels back up here and recapture the citadel
16147,come on
16148,how are we faring
16149,what
16150,no no you stay here youre the only one theyll follow ill go
16151,well tell me
16152,yeah
16153,all right
16154,thank you look after sarah for me
16155,ettis come away from that thing
16156,if you use that sonic lance youll be killing your own queen and a lot of your own people now most of the ice warriors are in that mine the peladonians are fighting them ettis soldiers and miners together and theyre winning
16157,ettis
16158,come on ettis this is pointless
16159,no ettis no
16160,gebek
16161,well something did the whole gun blew up
16162,im afraid hes dead how are things going
16163,yes ive noticed well they probably switched the ventilation system off
16164,wheres the ventilation controlled from do you know
16165,well youd better take me there straight away and by the way wheres sarah well answer me man where is she
16166,what
16167,well its not your fault is it now dont worry old chap well find her
16168,im afraid that its eckersley that has been summoning up aggedor and now hes using him to attack your miners
16169,no if we show our faces in there azaxyr will wipe us out without a qualm im sorry gebek weve got to wait our chance
16170,how long will it take them to get back to the communications room
16171,thats how long weve got to get rid of our friend here fix that alarm system and get back into the refinery
16172,yes im well aware of that
16173,luckily for me that was ettis
16174,my dear sarah theres nothing i like more than a quiet life now if youll excuse me ive got something very important to do in a very short space of time look can you get him out of the light
16175,nearly finished
16176,right thats the alarm fixed now for the door
16177,right thats it in you go
16178,yes ive seen it
16179,mmm
16180,oh thats just a simple matter projector linked to a directional heat ray the projector sends an image of that and the heat ray does the damage
16181,yes thats right by eckersley or one of his ice warrior friends very clever piece of work this quite an engineer our friend eckersley
16182,right keep your fingers crossed here goes
16183,right weve got a chance to win now gebek get back to the mines and rally your men
16184,well well have to make them think differently wont we
16185,my dear chap its perfectly simple now all we have to do is to arrange a time and a place between us in advance then get all your men together
16186,well i hope gebeks timings right just about now i think
16187,oh there are preset coordinates for almost everywhere eckersleys worked it out very well  eckersley
16188,ah then you must know that im in complete control of aggedor so may i suggest that you give yourself up straight away
16189,ah hes just bluffing  eckersley
16190,sarah get out of here straight away warn gebek theyre probably waiting for him ill try and help out with aggedor
16191,oh this sort of nonsense doesnt worry me you know that
16192,sarah please go
16193,sorry old chap i cant stop and talk now im rather busy
16194,tears
16195,well even i couldnt stand the row from eckersleys patent alarm system any longer so i put myself into a complete sensory withdrawal
16196,well a sort of trance i shut myself off
16197,well dont sound so aggrieved anybody would think you prefer me dead come on lets go and find the others
16198,what
16199,how well does eckersley know these tunnels
16200,yeah well dont worry i think i know a way we can track him down
16201,dont move eckersley
16202,oh yes aggedor may be getting on a bit but he can still sniff out a trail im sorry old chap but its all over
16203,get him
16204,yes well as a matter of fact your majesty
16205,well i know just the man your majesty gebek
16206,its the man that counts your majesty you can always give him a title
16207,well i shall always be grateful for the honour your majesty but im quite certain that gebek is the right man
16208,well thats splendid news splendid
16209,yes
16210,thank you gebek thank you very much ill go and check on it straight away with your majestys permission
16211,in you get sarah i think its time i took you home

16213,well you enjoyed that
16214,theyd take some adapting  host
16215,ah professor clegg how good of you to come
16216,yes its my fault entirely i do apologise wont you sit down
16217,well you see professor im doing a little research into esp
16218,you see professor my particular field covers er psycholotry telepathy and clairvoyance as well so i thought perhaps you might be able to help me
16219,you disappoint me professor
16220,just a word code with your assistant eh
16221,oh indeed it is professor indeed it is
16222,i assure you that i shall tell nobody that you are really a very powerful clairvoyant
16223,thats your real secret isnt it
16224,you made a couple of mistakes last night professor you gave the answer before your assistant had uttered a word
16225,physical manifestations psychokinesis for example
16226,thats remarkable
16227,a very rarely developed faculty in homo sapiens professor mister clegg would you give us a demonstration
16228,please
16229,mister clegg your powers may seem to be extraordinary but i assure you that they lie dormant in everyone theyre perfectly natural
16230,but thats what my experiments are all about mister clegg
16231,possibly
16232,good
16233,you see brigadier the electrocephalograph will show us his brainwaves on here as we carry out the tests right lets try a little simple psycholotry shall we er lethbridge stewart my dear fellow would you like to give mister clegg some little article of yours
16234,right ready when you are mister clegg
16235,a little too much perhaps eh alastair
16236,indeed you are professor indeed you are
16237,what from jo
16238,well lets take a look
16239,brigadier please
16240,the crystal from metebelis three thank you mister clegg lets take a look shall we
16241,and were at our twenty eighth native village no hang about twenty ninth switch on the light for me sergeant will you
16242,we havent found our toadstool yet and were not likely to if i dont get rid of this crystal you see the indian porters say its bad magic like it goes or they go so doctor if youre away on a cheap day trip to mars perhaps you could look after it for me brigadier or if youre away in geneva how about it mike or my lovely sergeant benton
16243,and the coffees just about as filthy as unit tea if thats possible i must go now or ill miss the next cleftstick to civilisation
16244,youre too late brigadier hes dead
16245,no i dont see how it could have done
16246,wait a minute now there is a chance
16247,well professor clegg was attached to this iris machine when he died perhaps it recorded his thoughts
16248,i must look into the crystal myself
16249,ill bear it in mind brigadier
16250,hmm
16251,well im already responsible for the death of one man sergeant thanks just the same
16252,absolutely beautiful
16253,oh the smell of that coffee thank you sergeant
16254,you know ive always said that next to mrs samuel pepys you make the finest cup of coffee in the world
16255,spiders
16256,oh yes you know brigadier when i was a young man there was an old hermit who lived half way up a mountain just behind our house i spent some of the finest hours of my life with that old man
16257,and it was from him i first learnt how to look into my mind
16258,thats what im trying to tell you brigadier when i looked into that crystal all i could see was the face of my old teacher
16259,of course im listening sarah go on what happened next
16260,hmm mmm
16261,oh thats fascinating
16262,the crystal lattice is equally balanced from right to left its remarkable
16263,yes of course i am you went down into the cellar to see if tommy was still there right
16264,probably analogous to the laser well go on im listening
16265,its coherent thought
16266,a scientific pun what did you say
16267,no no no before that what did you say before that did you say spider
16268,now listen to me sarah this is very important tell me the whole story right from the beginning
16269,so you see its after seeing these spiders that he died so there must be some connection
16270,oh i brought it back some time ago from a planet called metebelis three
16271,oh you wouldnt have done its also called the blue planet because the moonlight is blue you see
16272,no i went there deliberately to fetch it it has strange properties a metebelis crystal it can affect the mind
16273,no just the opposite usually it clears the mind and amplifies its power
16274,oh yes of course if the mind operating it was motivated by evil
16275,but there arent any giant spiders on metebelis three at least there werent any when i was there
16276,wait a minute there could be a time difference
16277,or a later one
16278,no just wait a minute give me a chance to work this thing out
16279,well theyre just as real
16280,what happened sergeant somebody attack you
16281,no no brigadier youll damage my car
16282,well done sergeant take me to the airstrip well spot him from the air
16283,hello brigadier look is this thing working can you hear me over
16284,yes hes getting away from you take the next right fork try and cut him off out
16285,hes turned off to the right brigadier i say again hes turned off to the right
16286,oh no he hasnt
16287,right fasten your seatbelt
16288,stand well back brigadier
16289,yes of course were flying
16290,now keep your eyes peeled for the gyroplane
16291,right hang on
16292,nothing he cant last much longer he must be almost out of fuel     spider
16293,oh about eighty miles i should say
16294,no no of course not
16295,look venerable may we see this man lupton now im sorry to seem pushy but it is very important
16296,and itll all be the same in a hundred years yes where have i heard that before
16297,yes er venerable could we see mister lupton now please
16298,i think hes trying to tell you something important mike
16299,where is this cellar mike
16300,get out of my way
16301,well never mind i doubt if he could have told us very much anyway well theres only one thing for me to do mike ive got to get after her to metebelis three
16302,yes of course
16303,well the tardis may be a little erratic ill admit after all she is getting on a bit but metebelis three is the one planet i can be absolutely certain of reaching you see i wired the coordinates into the programmer
16304,yes well i always leave the actual landing to the tardis herself shes no fool you know
16305,yes yes i do dont i bye mike
16306,hello sarah jane
16307,dont do that
16308,the queen oh yes yes of course greetings o most noble queen may i ask what you intend to do with this young lady
16309,both miss smith and i come from earth your majesty
16310,now just a minute your majesty
16311,sarah
16312,sarah tardis in the in the tardis theres a machine in that old old leather satchel its the only thing that will save me
16313,yes
16314,sarah sarah jane
16315,give it to me
16316,wakey wakey rise and shine show a leg the weathers fine
16317,mmm this is good its very good what is it
16318,mutton you have sheep on metebelis three
16319,thank you
16320,so your ancestors were colonists
16321,over four hundred years ago you know the story very well dont you
16322,an oral tradition so detailed its fascinating
16323,oh sarahll be all right for the moment
16324,because the spidersll be watching her theyll want to know how she got here and why
16325,mmm yes i think i can but first of all i must know what were up against how did the spiders get here
16326,i see
16327,hmm go out and get me some stones will you
16328,yes pebbles you know about that big little pieces of rock as many different kinds as you can
16329,lets just saying im playing a hunch hmm
16330,why should the blue crystal be the only mineral on metebelis three with an unusual structure now im looking for a stone that will absorb the energy of the spiders attacks oh i do beg your pardon the eight legs attacks
16331,no ive got something much better than that
16332,oh very well
16333,arak tuar
16334,oh i wouldnt say that hes a highly intelligent fellow you can tell at a glance
16335,ah poor fellow i hope they wont be too hard on him he fell into bad company you know oh well i must be off
16336,oh dear this is getting monotonous
16337,well now i know what a fly feels like what an absolutely fascinating experience
16338,judging by the habits of our captors earth cousins i would say were probably in the larder
16339,i think theyll find im rather a tough old bird
16340,yes yes make a good item on the next agenda of the spider council meeting whether to stew a time lord or roast him in a slow oven
16341,yes something they can really get their teeth into what
16342,they didnt arrive until much later were in the future remember sarah
16343,now listen to me both of you listen arak is trying to get together some of the men from the other villages theyre going to try a rescue
16344,ah no no they know how to protect themselves now
16345,well you see what
16346,where are you taking her
16347,sarah try and stall them as long as you can
16348,look much as i admire your stoic acceptance of the inevitable i would appreciate it if youd shut up for a moment what im trying to do requires the utmost concentration
16349,compress the muscles its a little a little trick i learned from an old friend of mine
16350,i heard the voice of my assistant  great one
16351,sarah so youre safe then
16352,look theres no time for foolish
16353,goes the weasel
16354,how did you manage that
16355,the key ive lost the key
16356,sarah
16357,oh theyll be out for quite a time but as long as theyre unconscious theyre quite safe
16358,oh theyve been taken over
16359,yes
16360,where are you taking us
16361,yes yes sarah all in good time
16362,kanpo
16363,i apologised to the rinpoche for not bringing him a cotton scarf
16364,yes well i have a strange feeling that you already know most of it you see i found a crystal a blue crystal
16365,well perhaps stole might be a better word forgive me have we met before
16366,well it didnt occur to me that i had stolen it at the time you see       spider
16367,so you see the crystal was even more important than i thought they want it very badly
16368,no sir never once they get a hold of that crystal nothing can stop them taking over the earth
16369,or even the universe itself i wish i knew where that crystal was at this moment
16370,thank heavens its safe
16371,sarah whats the matter with you
16372,sarah whats come over you
16373,sarah what has the queen spider done to you what has she done
16374,good grief     spider
16375,sarah listen to me struggle against the spider sarah fight it  queen
16376,sarah look at the crystal look at it look deep into its blue light  queen
16377,concentrate sarah concentrate
16378,what have you got to be sorry about you did very well you should be proud of yourself
16379,do you mean me
16380,oh no sarah no no hes talking about my greed
16381,yes my greed for knowledge for information hes saying that all this is basically my fault if i hadnt taken the crystal in the first place i know who you are now
16382,its been a long long time
16383,oh yes yes he was my teacher my my guru if you like in another time another place
16384,no nor for me
16385,yes well i had to get away i hadnt your power
16386,yes yes when a time lords body wears out he regenerates becomes new
16387,me too im afraid
16388,shush
16389,no
16390,very well give me the crystal
16391,take the crystal to the great one
16392,nevertheless i have to go
16393,arak tuar your attack was a success then
16394,look i need your help i want to go into the mountain into the cave of crystal
16395,well nevertheless i have to go will you show me the way
16396,to return the crystal
16397,yes yes of course
16398,no i shall return the crystal only to the great one herself
16399,is there any among you would dare take it from me
16400,well if i had not why should i have returned  great one
16401,well why is it so important to you
16402,and then
16403,but youve built a positive feedback circuit youre trying to increase your mental powers to infinity
16404,now listen to me listen i havent got much time left what youre trying to do is impossible if you complete that circuit the energy will build up and up until it cannot be contained you will destroy yourself
16405,stop stop dont you see whats happened to you
16406,hello sarah i got lost in the time vortex the tardis brought me home
16407,i had to face my fear sarah i had to face my fear that was more important than just going on living
16408,a tear sarah jane no dont cry while theres life theres
16409,human history
16410,i tell you brigadier theres nothing to worry about the brontosaurus is large and placid
16411,and stupid if the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the square on the other two sides why is a mouse when it spins never did know the answer to that one
16412,ah
16413,am i dont you mean the infirmary
16414,not fit im the doctor
16415,you may be a doctor but im the doctor the definite article you might say
16416,not fit not fit of course im fit all systems go
16417,hearts beat
16418,both a bit fast are they
16419,oh as for the physiognomy well nothings perfect have to take the rough with the smooth mind you i think the nose is a definite improvement as for the ears well im not too sure tell me quite frankly what do you say to the ears
16420,well of course you dont why should you youre a busy man you dont want to stand here burbling about my ears neither here nor there i cant waste any more time things to do places to go im a busy man too you know thank you for a most interesting conversation must be on my way
16421,how can i prove my point
16422,mother mother i feel sick send for the doctor quick quick quick mother dear shall i die yes my darling by and by one two three four
16423,hello come to see me off have you well i hate goodbyes ill just slip away quietly
16424,cant cant theres no such word as cant
16425,what for
16426,cant i goodbye
16427,excuse me
16428,havent me met somewhere before no dont tell me alexander the great no hannibal no ah brigadier brigadier alistair gordon lethbridge stewart how are you
16429,and sarah jane well now isnt this nice what was that you said about a secret weapon          brigadier
16430,ah brigadier
16431,is something wrong
16432,oh no not again
16433,dont you like them
16434,do you think i might attract attention
16435,one moment
16436,ill try again if you like
16437,time we were off
16438,to visit the scene of the crime
16439,tell me on the way brigadier tell me on the way you must cultivate a sense of urgency
16440,oh but i am i assure you look
16441,not just squashed flattened almost pulverised
16442,exactly and according to my estimation of the resistance to pressure of vegetable fibre it was stepped on by something that weighed a quarter of a ton
16443,hmm just what youd need for the control circuitry of one powerful compact technological device a disintegrator gun for instance
16444,something that brushes chains and electric fences like cobwebs something intelligent that takes only what it needs and leaves the rest something that kills a man as casually as it crushes a dandelion
16445,i doubt it brigadier more than human perhaps
16446,by locking the next stable door in good time
16447,it whatever it may be has stolen the plans for the new disintegrator gun it has also in its possession the necessary control circuitry
16448,why else steal the plans and the circuitry now assuming im right and i invariably am what is the third vital ingredient
16449,exactly brigadier exactly
16450,never cared much for the word impregnable sounds a bit too much like unsinkable
16451,nothing as the iceberg said to the titanic
16452,glug glug glug
16453,that still leaves one direction
16454,perhaps you should employ the services of a very large cat
16455,whoever went through it didnt need to breathe
16456,why should some alien life form invade earth just to steal a new weapon if they were that advanced theyd have weapons of their own ha rather a splendid paradox eh brigadier
16457,well they might steal the plans but why steal the circuits and the generators an enemy government would have those resources itself
16458,i think your enemies are home grown brigadier people with access to technological information and a most unusual weapon a weapon that walks and thinks in a word anthropomorphic
16459,only that theyre prepared to kill to protect themselves wheres sarah
16460,oh its surely not that difficult brigadier oh thank you there cant be many groups of people with the money and resources to design and build something like
16461,yes something like that however did you guess
16462,scientific or medical
16463,id like to talk to professor kettlewell
16464,plans for a new solar battery
16465,this will never do you know
16466,if theta over x coincides with your disputed factor youre losing half your output
16467,look the errors in the third part of the calculation
16468,but youre doing vital work professor earths human race should have started tapping solar power long ago
16469,well there you are
16470,people never can see whats under their noses and above their heads
16471,and copernicus
16472,professor i think you ought to tell us about the robot
16473,but the circuitry you built could be altered or tampered with
16474,disintegrated
16475,i think the brigadier has an idea eh alastair
16476,who was this man
16477,anything interesting
16478,oh really and who might they be
16479,yes go on then
16480,lets pay a visit to think tank tomorrow brigadier we can ask them to demonstrate professor kettlewells robot good night
16481,cant thank you enough for the visit been most amusing
16482,yes it does rather but never mind youve got to start somewhere but there is one thing im looking forward to professor kettlewells robot its in here isnt it
16483,oh dear i do so hate being disappointed i was determined to see that robot
16484,what and such a harmless creature too
16485,what concern compassion and useless things like that
16486,now that is a pity you see one of our problems miss winters is oh i say you havent still got the bits have you maybe i could put it together again im really rather good at that sort of thing
16487,in that case im sure we neednt bother come along brigadier miss winters has a great deal to do
16488,please dont let us detain you
16489,you know i have a feeling we shall meet again
16490,no of course not and they know i didnt and i know that they know that i didnt and they know that i know that
16491,either its wandered off somewhere by itself or theyve hidden it
16492,i beg your pardon brigadier i was just thinking
16493,professor kettlewell professor kettlewell professor
16494,how do you do ive been so looking forward to meeting you
16495,yes yes of course
16496,how very kind of you
16497,then you mustnt harm me im a friend of humanity
16498,extraordinary extraordinary  the hat falls off and the robot hits the doctor knocking him down he tries to crawl away but the robot advances menacingly
16499,then you must act without it i know what theyre up to now worked it all out while i was having my little nap its all tied up with the information stolen from that poor fellow chambers he must have been the guardian of some kind of ultimate threat
16500,i dont know exactly what it is just the kind of thing it has to be well am i right
16501,well naturally i mean the rest were all foreigners
16502,yes and start a nuclear holocaust that would turn this little planet of yours into a radioactive cinder suspended in space
16503,im afraid so
16504,kettlewell you let sarah go off somewhere with kettlewell
16505,where is that pass
16506,good evening everyone now please stay calm everyone keep your seat now then what can i do to entertain you till my friend the brigadier arrives a little song a little dance perhaps not just a little dance anyone for cards
16507,now for my next trick i shall require the assistance of a member of the audience
16508,arent you forgetting that in science as in morality the end never justifies the means
16509,you see what i mean professor
16510,it had to be kettlewell only he could have attempted to reprogramme the robot to overcome its prime directive
16511,faked faked to gain your confidence and they still have the destructor codes and sarah and now theyll hide up somewhere and try their blackmail plan i suppose
16512,i rather imagine that has occurred to them youd better find them brigadier and soon
16513,or broken head if someone overheard him calling us
16514,so if their bluff is called theyll stay down there safe and sound and emerge to rule the survivors if any
16515,down brigadier everyone get down
16516,i dont think so brigadier automated machine gun nest i fancy activated by body heat when you get within range
16517,good man      benton
16518,just a moment brigadier
16519,oh no must you i really think weve had enough bangs and flashes for a bit dont you hold on turns into a miniature sonic lance you see
16520,cut out the lock for you it shouldnt take long  the doctor moves the sonic screwdriver around the area of the lock the metal flames and melts
16521,back everybody back
16522,i very much doubt it get your men back brigadier if you dont want them killed
16523,i very much doubt it brigadier
16524,power almost unlimited range well it could drill a hole in the surface of the moon
16525,yes well its no use staying here brigadier prepare your men for an attack try and draw the robot away from the door ill slip round behind it and finish cutting the lock
16526,i know but we have to try
16527,sarah
16528,nows our chance
16529,the trouble with computers of course is that theyre very sophisticated idiots they do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed even if you order them to kill you so if you do happen to change your mind its very difficult to stop them obeying the original order but
16530,and sarah
16531,gone home you mean not one of you connected the disappearance of sarah with the vanishing of the robot
16532,i think so dont you
16533,the robot killed kettlewell remember the man who created it it must be in a state of tremendous emotional shock what more natural than it should turn to the one person who ever showed it kindness
16534,there is just one teeny weeny little thing
16535,something else you havent thought of what are we going to do with it when we find it
16536,did he now
16537,the same way that disease attacks animal tissue
16538,yes
16539,wonderful mister benton wonderful brigadier i must get to kettlewells place at once you find the robot
16540,why didnt that silly man write up his experiments properly    brigadier
16541,tell him to stop pestering me ive found a metal virus and im trying to prepare an active solution but he must give me time
16542,what yes yes of course suppressed oedipus complex leading to excessive guilt and overcompensation  brigadier
16543,weve done it harry weve done it
16544,said alice
16545,i see our little problem seems to have grown wheres sarah
16546,really brigadier you should be more careful with your little toys youve given it just the infusion of energy it needed
16547,i hope that wont be necessary
16548,another piece of brilliance from the late professor kettlewell and one that will solve our problem i hope drive on harry
16549,wish me luck brigadier
16550,some of kettlewells metal virus in an active solution
16551,oh even faster i hope look
16552,thank you harry
16553,no no brigadier that wont be necessary look
16554,it was a wonderful creature capable of great good and great evil yes i think you could say it was human you know what you need is a change how about a little trip in a tardis im just off
16555,why not its a free cosmos
16556,the brigadier wants me to address the cabinet have lunch at downing street dinner at the palace and write seventeen reports in triplicate well i wont do it i wont i wont i wont
16557,well of course i am theres no point in being grown up if you cant be childish sometimes are you coming
16558,were just going on a little trip would you like a jelly baby
16559,yes as a matter of fact in that old police box
16560,do we
16561,is it you wouldnt like to step inside a moment just to demonstrate that it is all an illusion
16562,oh yes itll make me feel a lot better
16563,in you go
16564,youre a clumsy ham fisted idiot  harry
16565,ive no idea
16566,i didnt expect him to start messing about with the helmic regulator come away from there harry
16567,i could what
16568,not much oxygen still nothing to worry about
16569,we can survive for quite a time yet
16570,just a simply gravity reading sarah yes almost certainly were in some kind of artificial satellite now isnt that interesting
16571,i think it is
16572,all we have to do is get the power back on lets see whats over here
16573,yes thats better incredible
16574,ive never seen anything quite like it
16575,definitely build on earth but i cant quite place the period    sarah
16576,judging by the macroslave drive and that modified version of the bennett oscillator id say this was built in the early thirtieth century
16577,you dont agree
16578,late twenty ninth early thirtieth i feel sure
16579,good heavens no well beyond that
16580,well you gave that helmic regulator quite a twist im afraid
16581,its difficult to say all this stuffs obviously been here for some time several thousand years at least what was that
16582,impossible ive got the key ive told her time an again about going off by herself sarah
16583,there must be another exit then
16584,vacuumtight panel more likely they used them a lot in these early space vessels ah just as i thought
16585,there must be a remote control you havent touched anything have you harry
16586,well there are only two of us here and your name is harry
16587,which switch harry
16588,which switch
16589,try to remember harry
16590,think where you were standing
16591,sure
16592,go on press it
16593,no air in here help me to get her back
16594,there must be a reverse mechanism
16595,how is she harry
16596,must be a broken circuit
16597,nothing nothings working properly here
16598,ive found the oxygen supply
16599,no good harry
16600,why is nothing functioning here
16601,what with our bare hands
16602,i got us into this harry
16603,then lie down and conserve the oxygen while i do what i can thats odd
16604,these cables have been sheared clean through oxygen valve servomechanism yellow black green
16605,just in time are you feeling better
16606,good give me a hand to lay her on that couch its nearer the vents
16607,ill just repair some of those cables
16608,or bitten
16609,theres a mystery here harry something happened a long time ago
16610,it looks like it the interesting question is why clearly deliberate therefore done for a purpose therefore whatever it was had a reasoning intelligence
16611,splendid now lets see if that panel works
16612,good
16613,welcome back sarah jane
16614,theres some in the tardis
16615,get down harry
16616,keep your head down            doctor
16617,some sort of automatic guard i hadnt bargained on this when i repaired the circuits i wonder of course thats why they were cut in the first place
16618,tell her to stay where she is
16619,apparently its not activated by movement unless what moves is organic
16620,not down here were not harry
16621,thank you       woman
16622,to the far wall
16623,inch it round your end
16624,one slip harry and well be charcoal push on
16625,psst there it is
16626,the trouble is we cant reach it from here
16627,the autoguard cutout look up there see never mind faithful old scarf
16628,it isnt a game of cricket harry
16629,will this do
16630,afraid so
16631,theres only one thing left risky but it might work you dont want your other shoe do you
16632,slip it off right now i want you to throw it across the room when i give the word understand
16633,im going to try to distract it lets hope its not doublebarrelled ready
16634,now
16635,sarah
16636,why didnt i realise short range matter transmitter the strange thing is harry its only for internal relay
16637,never mind it just means that sarah cant be far away all weve got to do is find her come on
16638,not very likely
16639,dont be nervous harry
16640,nonsense harry
16641,a trick of the light
16642,its like the trail left by a gastropod mollusc
16643,or a snail
16644,very interesting a multinucleate organism
16645,lets find sarah first come on
16646,decontamination chamber might make you feel a bit dizzy
16647,then pull yourself together man this is fascinating this is a cryogenic repository
16648,everything well everything they considered worth preserving look at this
16649,posterity i dont know why build all this and send it into space
16650,survival
16651,youre improving harry
16652,yes your mind is beginning to work its entirely due my influence of course you mustnt take any credit now whats missing
16653,yes if we are to assume that some great cataclysm struck earth and that before the end they launched this lifeboat then the one obvious missing element is man himself whats happened to the human species harry
16654,this isnt a mortuary harry quite the reverse
16655,cryogenic chamber
16656,old principle but ive never seen it applied on this scale look at them
16657,corpse these people arent dead harry theyre asleep the entire human race awaiting the trumpet blast
16658,homo sapiens what an inventive invincible species its only a few million years since theyve crawled up out of the mud and learned to walk puny defenceless bipeds theyve survived flood famine and plague theyve survived cosmic wars and holocausts and now here they are amongst the stars waiting to begin a new life ready to outsit eternity theyre indomitable indomitable
16659,suspended animation
16660,total suspension harry
16661,fifty thousand years a hundred thousand time is immaterial its an amazing sight isnt it the entire human race in one room all colours all creeds all differences finally forgotten
16662,well its chosen descendents the operation must have been meticulously planned come on
16663,first to find sarah then were going to shut down the systems were intruders here you know
16664,not end harry just a pause
16665,yes and they saw it coming and made provision for it as best they could dont forget its something for you to be proud of
16666,yes
16667,oxygen radiant heat but this deep in space i wonder
16668,mould
16669,and that thing you saw moving in the corridor
16670,hmm very convincing all the same i think well just check a few of the beds while were here
16671,just to make sure that everythings in order
16672,what have you found
16673,no shell be like that for three thousand years at least even if we had a resuscitation unit its doubtful that we could revive her now
16674,very like an oxygen cylinder
16675,very dead almost mummified
16676,thats something we can leave till later no sign of the resuscitation tank
16677,emergency medical kit wouldnt you say
16678,there must be something there that would help sarah but what what
16679,of course they dont need a tank the resuscitation phase is programmed in
16680,no doubt about it
16681,leave her harry
16682,theres nothing you can do she knows what shes doing
16683,well there isnt very much to explain were just travellers in space like yourself
16684,my doctorate is purely honorary and harry here is only qualified to work on sailors
16685,well im delighted to hear it you see we happen to be in rather desperate need of medical help
16686,is there any way of reversing the cryogenic process
16687,the answer is yes
16688,perhaps we both are
16689,i see youve changed her body into a battlefield
16690,we do seem to have a small communications problem
16691,what happened in the last days vira
16692,im afraid youre probably wrong about that
16693,ah solar flares i see
16694,oh the absolute minimum id say but im afraid ive something of a shock for you vira
16695,youve overslept by several thousand years you see when we came here we found a massive systems failure
16696,possibly not but a long time ago when you were dormant you had a visitor come ill show it to you
16697,i dont know yet but observe the size of the brain pan it had a purpose in coming here and once inside it severed most of the satellites control systems including your alarm clock so to speak
16698,no for once in my life i feel surplus to requirements
16699,what is it
16700,i dont think the faults at this end its in the main power supply
16701,dont worry i noticed the ark has a secondary power supply harry you stay here and keep an eye on things
16702,splendid the fault seems to be in the main solar stack im just going to take a look  harry
16703,im just shutting down the power in the main stack
16704,noah
16705,my dear man if you think for one moment were laying claim to earth you couldnt be more mistaken were here to help you
16706,precisely theres something trapped in the stack noah but at the rate its absorbing energy it wont be trapped for long the stack must be shut down well if youd been down there with me noah you
16707,you wouldnt find it so amusing
16708,ah sarah youre back splendid wheres noah shot me did he cut off in mid sentence i might have been saying something important i was saying something important
16709,what blinding headache thats all i hate stun guns where is he
16710,noah of course who else
16711,what the idiot quick there might be still time
16712,never mind about me harry theres a man in danger
16713,not her function harry
16714,by the thirtieth century human society was highly compartmentalised vira is a medtech and i suspect were an executive problem
16715,unlike the thing you saw in the solar stack eh noah
16716,then its escaped were too late
16717,youre absolutely right theres no time to lose come on
16718,what was it you saw libri
16719,the process is much too slow theyre not going to make it
16720,he must be stopped
16721,get after him man
16722,dont be an imbecile tell him vira
16723,can you be sure
16724,when you first saw him you had a subconscious impression you said of something horrible that wasnt noah was it
16725,believe me he must be stopped
16726,you take some convincing that were on your side dont you now whats all this about a missing technician
16727,its not quite empty
16728,membrane
16729,part of the eggshell
16730,its almost too horrible to think about
16731,the progenitor the queen coloniser
16732,ever heard of the eumenes
16733,its a genus of wasps that paralyses caterpillars and lays its eggs in their bodies when the larvae emerge they have a ready made food supply strange how the same life patterns recur throughout the universe
16734,ciliated larvae harry dune was power systems technician i imagine
16735,it or they went straight to the solar stack
16736,has been thoroughly digested im afraid
16737,when i say im afraid sarah im not making jokes
16738,absorb we shall absorb the humans endoparasitism
16739,if the wirrn can do that weve no chance at all complete physical absorption
16740,theyll literally eat us alive vira i must talk with noah youd better come with me he trusts you
16741,no noah has passed the command to you your duties have been widened
16742,to find out exactly what it is were facing and only noah knows that
16743,harry can handle that for you cant you harry
16744,hell be all right
16745,noah tell us one thing how much time do we have
16746,before the wirrn reach their adult form
16747,lets go back
16748,but unfortunately its larvae are still very much alive
16749,how much anatomy do you remember harry
16750,we need to find its weaknesses and we need to find them quickly
16751,not at the moment thank you
16752,what was that she just said
16753,what  carry on with that thoracic incision not too deep
16754,vira the main phase must wait
16755,noah was wrong how long would it take
16756,four whole days at the rate at which the wirrn are developing theyll have pupated to imago long before then and you know what that means
16757,you cant do it vira the ark will be crawling with those creatures within hours
16758,vira if you fail your people will die in pain and fear if i fail theyll die anyway but at least only the six of us will know anything about it
16759,between the larval and imago forms there must be a pupal stage now the wirrn will be dormant and defenceless if we can find their weaknesses
16760,yes
16761,good
16762,no the larvae have taken over the infrastructure they seem to need solar radiation
16763,yes fascinating a superb adaptation
16764,obviously the creatures lungs recycle the wastes almost certainly by enzymes quite wonderful carbon dioxide back to oxygen
16765,exactly right it must live in space probably just occasionally visiting a planetary atmosphere for food and oxygen the way a whale rises from the ocean
16766,no
16767,he now has the race memory of a wirrn symbiotic atavism to be precise im going to need your help now vira
16768,hurry man fetch them
16769,a little experiment circuit display lycett
16770,right switch on the video circuit lycett itll take a little time to warm up
16771,sometimes latent neural impressions can be revived
16772,yes
16773,advanced technology gypsies used to believe that the eye retained its last image after death not so far out no its not going to work switch off lycett
16774,it should work the coil isnt giving a strong enough stimulus ill have to link in my own cerebral cortex thats the only thing
16775,i know two more leads rogin
16776,i agree an ordinary brain but mine is exceptional
16777,i think not unless of course the experiment was interrupted that could be dangerous
16778,if i can find out what it was that killed that creature we might have a chance of fighting the wirrn thats our only hope
16779,its not just our existence thats at stake sarah its the entire human race
16780,take this  dont hesitate to use it if anything goes wrong you wont have much time
16781,switch on lycett lycett
16782,look its working
16783,wirrn wirrn
16784,wirrn
16785,cant what is it time to get up
16786,is that noise in my head
16787,aim lower
16788,why why have they gone over to the attack
16789,but theyve only to wait in their adult form theyll be a thousand times deadlier fission guns will have no effect then
16790,at a hatching a hundred
16791,electricity only by electricity thats the one thing i found out
16792,yes it was the autoguard that killed the queen half a million volts
16793,amazing will power i could feel it struggling against death until its task was done yes rogin is there any way we can electrify the infrastructure
16794,control centre right lets go
16795,yes i was forgetting noahs extra mobility
16796,no the wirrn are using dunes knowledge of the ark perhaps theres something he didnt know
16797,nobody knows it all perhaps hes forgotten that these transmats are reversible
16798,isnt it and as you appreciate it rogin you can go first ill give you a hand come on
16799,you next harry
16800,that was a power drain hello control centre  rogin
16801,hmm malicious damage excluded
16802,of course in their pupal stage the wirrn dont need oxygen an easy way of killing us
16803,what were not finished yet you two stay here
16804,the infrastructure if theyve entered the pupal stage theyll be dormant  the doctor cranks the door open by hand give me a chance to get down there and switch the power back on
16805,no im not i think his jobs done now hell be metamorphosing too
16806,but the wirrn live in space you dont need the ark
16807,but you could leave the ark and go on theres plenty of room in the galaxy for us all
16808,time to leave
16809,we bumped into noah
16810,yes quite chatty this time garrulous even
16811,anyone for a jelly baby
16812,no
16813,vira has no intention of leaving here have you vira
16814,of course you cant so neither can we
16815,besides we cant let the wirrn eat through the cryogenic sleepers as though they were a lot of
16816,exactly let them be turned into a lot of surrogate humans its the most immoral suggestion ive heard for a century
16817,high voltage power if we can somehow send enough electrical power through the bulkheads of the cryogenic chamber
16818,yes the wirrn would never dare to cross it the only problem is we dont have any electrical power and they control its sources the solar stacks
16819,unless we can lure them out of the infrastructure
16820,bait human bait if one of us could distract them for a few moments i might be able to get down there and turn the power on
16821,sarah were trying to make a plan
16822,not if we electrify the switch itself
16823,well we cant do without oxygen indefinitely what was that you were trying to say sarah
16824,what about it
16825,how can we reach it
16826,arent there conduits
16827,good girl sarah come on wed better hurry the wirrn are going to start moving any moment you four go to the transport ship and ill start wiring up the cryogenic chamber
16828,come on sarah hurry  sarah
16829,oh doctor is that all you can say for yourself stupid foolish girl we should never have relied on you i knew youd let us down    doctor
16830,yes you do yes you do
16831,splendid
16832,youve done marvellously sarah im very proud of you i really am very proud of you
16833,me a brute
16834,dont be ungrateful i was only encouraging you come on
16835,are you ready man  rogin
16836,reporting to the others theyll know where we are now  vira
16837,i think weve got some more visitors dont let the power drop
16838,either discretion is the better part of valour or
16839,or theyre planning something
16840,unless they chew through the floor ive left a freerunning cable just in case the insulation should stand up to it
16841,cheer up were still on our feet
16842,no and neither shall we sarah what were protecting here is too precious
16843,well find out soon enough  wirrn
16844,listen noah now hear me youre beaten the ark is of no value to you without its humans so why dont you just leave us in peace
16845,the wirrn hate all humans once we step outside this chamber wed be attacked
16846,noah listen to me if theres any part of you thats still human if youve any memory of the man you once were leave the ark lead the swarm into space    doctor
16847,keep in touch
16848,hmm its your imagination
16849,how long will it take them to reach your control deck  vira
16850,into the ark fast as you can you too sarah harry you go with the girls
16851,just look after sarah harry
16852,theres no point in both of us being killed by the blast get into the ark man
16853,what
16854,rogins dead i woke up in a protection hatch
16855,yes were all safe now sarah thanks to rogins bravery and perhaps something else
16856,yes some vestige of human spirit was noah on our side and one step ahead of us at the end
16857,more than a vestige of human spirit it can all begin now vira mankind is safe
16858,yes
16859,yes it could if it was functioning properly the signals faulty probably the diode receptors ill just beam down and check them
16860,yes thats where the trouble is here fetch me a coat from the tardis will you you never know what the solar flares have done to the weather
16861,what probably no more than a spot of corrosion whatever it is it shouldnt take long to fix and itll give me a chance to see if the planet is fully viable again whats keeping them sarah  sarah
16862,i dont remember inviting you two
16863,i hope you dont mind being left
16864,have a jelly baby vira
16865,are you coming or going or going or coming
16866,yes well lets get on with it these must be the refractors
16867,yes
16868,sarah  sarah
16869,its not only oscillating its ellipsing as well youd better give her a hand harry
16870,hmm i see the problem focus gone a bit fuzzy
16871,ah sarah youre looking well look er its going to take some time to do the whole lot why dont you two make the most of it
16872,glorious day beautiful unspoilt countryside no ones set foot here for thousands of years
16873,id phrase it more elegantly myself of course yes
16874,enjoy yourselves trafalgar square should be that way
16875,if this is piccadilly
16876,mind the traffic
16877,harry
16878,is he a friend of yours
16879,no i            harry
16880,certainly what would you like me to talk about
16881,i didnt use one i came by transmat beam
16882,thats the truth who are you
16883,ah
16884,not creeping i was repairing the
16885,id not kill him i heard a cry and found him with his neck broken in a gully an accident i imagine
16886,thats right
16887,temporarily abandoned perhaps but not junked oh no
16888,im sorry to keep contradicting you but there is a transmat beam from space station nerva
16889,space station nerva
16890,nerva transmat beam earth its as simple as that why dont you believe me
16891,fascinating you dont believe it exists yet youve obviously heard of it
16892,lost colony ah you mean its become a legend like lost atlantis
16893,lost atlantis its a legendary city a go never mind this is extremely interesting are you going to cut me loose
16894,very colonial you are from a colony i take it
16895,of course on nerva they know that various colony ships left earth theyll be delighted to know that theyre not the sole survivors of the human race you are human
16896,oh no offence no offence do you mind if i take a close look at that    doctor
16897,ohm ten thousand years
16898,well no im a sort of travelling time expert as you can see earths been habitable for several thousand years but they didnt wake up why clock stopped overslept so here i am
16899,horologist actually and chronometrist i just love clocks atomic clocks wall quartz clocks grandfather clocks
16900,cuckoo clocks
16901,well no but then i didnt expect to meet anyone i understood earth wasnt inhabited
16902,a mayday then youre a military expedition i take it
16903,nine where are the rest
16904,oh rubbish thats just the reception point for the transmat beam
16905,that�s wild talk erak far from killing me you should treat me as an honoured guest
16906,well you dont want to be stuck here forever do you
16907,i might consider helping you
16908,simple i finish refocusing the matter beam then we all pop up to nerva you get in touch with your headquarters and they send a ship for you
16909,oh absolutely
16910,good girl sarah who�s your fast friend
16911,ive lost my sonic screwdriver i feel completely lost without it
16912,shush what would i do without you
16913,that machine you told me about could that have lifted him
16914,excuse me
16915,the machine now thats very interesting because theres no terullian to be found in this galaxy
16916,yes dont you worry about it old chap hes half demented with shock
16917,yes well i cant say i blame him for being wary of friend vural at any rate you know its absolutely typical of harry how anyone in his proper mind could fall down a whacking great subsidence like thats it
16918,subsidence a sewer or something maybe its the central line
16919,i mean here must be some way out at the bottom hang on sarah ill just go down and take a look
16920,its perfectly safe
16921,oh ow sarah sarah sarah are you there
16922,hello sarah
16923,if you insist
16924,behind you
16925,no its not the central line
16926,sarah listen to me sarah its not real do you understand nothing is happening to you its only in your mind
16927,you unspeakable abomination
16928,why did you do it to her
16929,well done harry
16930,not me piece of the synestic locking mechanism from nervas rocket popped it in my pocket
16931,foresight you never know when these bits and pieces will come in handy
16932,whats styre doing here
16933,harry sontarans never do anything without a military reason you look to sarah
16934,find out whats behind all this
16935,hello hello dont be alarmed old thing not going to hurt you everythings going to be all right    vural
16936,ah sarah feeling better no dont tell me no time weve got an invasion on our hands
16937,him and thousands exactly like him
16938,the entire galaxy suddenly acquired some strategic importance in their endless war against the rutans
16939,hes making an assessment of human physical limitations sontarans are very methodical people and that might give us a slight advantage
16940,im going to take him on in single combat
16941,sontarans never turn down the chance to kill someone
16942,i hope not im going to try and tire him out hes pretty unwieldy for all his strength and hes not used to earths gravity the thing is if i can get him exhausted hell have to go back to his ship to reenergise are you with me
16943,while i keep him busy i want you to get into his ship now once youre inside this is what i want you to do harry
16944,styre
16945,another mistake styre youve fallen right into our trap
16946,yes those people youve been so cleverly evaluating are not earth warriors theyre our slave class the lowest form of human intelligence
16947,do you think those puny creatures could conquer half a galaxy no styre i represent the true warrior class evaluate me if you dare
16948,styre its not over yet
16949,youre weakening styre youre weakening
16950,it had better be lets get out of here
16951,i know everybody out fast as you can come on
16952,ask harry he did it
16953,its a sort of terullian diode bypass transformer
16954,yes sontarans as i told you sometimes need to feed on pure energy and by removing that you altered things slightly and the energy fed on him
16955,yes well ill just attend to that    marshal
16956,what without styres report  marshal
16957,as you wish i should stand back if i were you
16958,whats going on dont you realise how dangerous it is to intercept a transmat beam
16959,look whatever ive done for you in the past ive more than made up for i will not tolerate this continual interference in my life
16960,except mine
16961,i wont do it whatever it is i refuse
16962,daleks tell me more
16963,thats possible tell on
16964,do you mean avert their creation
16965,hmm thats feasible
16966,all right just one more time
16967,yes if youll let me have the space time coordinates ill set the tardis for skaro
16968,huh
16969,what
16970,whats this
16971,whats that
16972,just a moment
16973,ah there you are sarah
16974,no theres been a slight change of plan
16975,heavy artillery
16976,its a creeping barrage get down
16977,all right
16978,thats strange theres centuries between these two weapons
16979,its like finding the remains of a stone age man with a transistor radio
16980,a thousand year war civilisation on the point of collapse
16981,nothing just theorising thats all
16982,er forward
16983,i see a land mine were in the middle of a mine field follow me and tread in my footsteps
16984,i thought i saw something move i have a feeling were being watched
16985,lets hope its imagination
16986,harry im standing on a land mine i felt it shift
16987,i wont
16988,you back up too harry no point in risking both our lives
16989,please harry dont be difficult
16990,thank you harry
16991,lets go
16992,protective dome
16993,yes
16994,even the dead have a part to play propped up to make the trenches appear fully manned
16995,yes we may have crossed the lines
16996,yes thats why i think this wars been going on for a very long time they probably started out with the most modern equipment but no longer have the resources they have to make do
16997,well it would explain the mixture of equipment
16998,lets see where the trench leads
16999,poison gas
17000,get back
17001,certainly
17002,yes ive heard that before
17003,i was just wondering how you propose to wipe the thals from the face of skaro with boy soldiers no ammunition and very young generals
17004,i do beg your pardon
17005,thats very impressive you mean youre going to sweep these wastelands absolutely
17006,yes so you said
17007,k a l e d s why thats an anagram of how interesting are you fit harry
17008,good now alexander the great youre going to lead us out of here
17009,you wont get any medals for being stupid general in fact you wont be getting any more medals for anything
17010,back to the wastelands
17011,come on
17012,yes
17013,what do you mean
17014,perhaps you should introduce us general
17015,yes but were not staying long dont let us detain you
17016,this way harry
17017,yes
17018,keep running
17019,keep running
17020,i wouldnt say that harry
17021,yes
17022,well its an etheric beam locator its also useful for detecting ion charged emissions
17023,well naturally not my friend and i are not from your planet
17024,we are not lying
17025,then he must be exceptional even i am occasionally wrong about some things who is this davros
17026,tell me what exactly are mutos
17027,in other words genetically wounded
17028,thats a very harsh policy
17029,good well now hes gone any chance of a cup of tea
17030,or coffee my friend and i have had a very trying experience havent we had a trying experience harry
17031,what no tea
17032,no tea harry
17033,you cant have that that bracelet could have no possible use as a weapon
17034,the time ring is our only hope of getting back to the tardis
17035,recovering it has got to be our number one priority do you understand harry its vital
17036,thank you youre not with the military i assume
17037,oh good good then perhaps we can talk without interruption from rifle butts
17038,oh here and there
17039,if you didnt know better
17040,it is also an established scientific fact that there are more than seven galaxies
17041,yes
17042,you were saying
17043,you cant always judge from external appearances
17044,its a long story
17045,do you have any inkling of the theory of space dimension correlated to relative time    kaled
17046,your chief scientist
17047,well i shall be delighted to meet him
17048,a dalek
17049,a dalek very primitive but undeniably a dalek
17050,if you say so
17051,thank you i am obliged to you
17052,looks like i might be
17053,they took down reams of notes every bit of scientific gobbledygook i could think of technical jargon that even i didnt understand
17054,yes and i learnt a great deal more from them than they did from me
17055,yes
17056,yes and bomb proof impregnable from attack from the outside and about three or four miles from the kaled dome
17057,years ago the kaled government decided to form an elite group the best scientific brains in every field
17058,yes but over the years the elite has become more and more powerful and now they can demand whatever they like  ronson
17059,but you did save me from becoming the very first victim of a dalek thank you
17060,well i have an advantage in terms of time you see weve come here at this time because of future concern about the development of the dalek i think youre concerned too arent you
17061,then let us help you
17062,the mutos
17063,youve got troubles
17064,go on ronson
17065,now hes trying to change that into a weapon
17066,then go to them ronson go to them
17067,then help us to escape give us the names of the men who have the power
17068,and i have an uneasy feeling youre going to tell me theyre in that cave
17069,dont worry dont worry we wont let it fall into the wrong hands
17070,heres where it comes out into the cave
17071,look
17072,easy easy
17073,one of davros experiments
17074,what
17075,never mind the latin lets have a look at your foot nothing seems to be broken its incredible you have some bruises though harry
17076,youll be all right can you stand up
17077,lets get out of here
17078,well find her weve got to contact the kaled leaders first
17079,yes of course and some of what i will tell you relates to events in the future not only on this planet but also on others whose existence you dont even know of but my knowledge is scientific fact now davros has created a machine creature a monster which will terrorise and destroy millions and millions of lives and lands throughout all eternity he has given this machine a name a dalek it is a word new to you but for a thousand generations it is a name that will bring fear and terror now undoubtedly davros has one of the finest scientific minds in existence but he has a fanatical desire to perpetuate himself in his machine he works without conscience without soul without pity and his machines are equally devoid of these qualities
17080,yes it was meant to be
17081,yes lets hope so harry sometimes words arent enough
17082,but that could take months davros already has several prototype daleks ready for action
17083,it is less than id hoped for
17084,thank you
17085,in the thal dome you say
17086,yes yes well never mind about that could you help us to find sarah
17087,oh good good
17088,thank you
17089,yes and thats when our troubles really begin
17090,shush    davros
17091,yes and we havent found sarah yet come on
17092,you all right sarah
17093,yes yes i know listen i want you and harry to go back to the kaled dome harry knows the way tell them all we know theres a chance if they launch and allout offensive i might be able to stop the rocket
17094,try to sabotage it or at least delay it off you go
17095,good luck
17096,well dont just stand there come on youre free go now while youve got the chance come on          councillor
17097,i sent harry and sarah in there
17098,yes two people very dear to me i sent them into that holocaust
17099,start again try and find a way to complete what i set out to do and stop the development of the daleks
17100,yes machine creatures that davros is developing monsters
17101,let me tell you something the kaled government was on the point of stopping davros experiments and rather than let that happen he helped you to destroy his own race
17102,yes for how long i wonder
17103,thank you
17104,keep back get out of sight
17105,out into the wastelands do you know a way
17106,perhaps they did but daleks accept no terms theyre programmed to wipe the thals from the face of this planet
17107,a few perhaps but they need to be grouped into some kind of fighting force to strike the bunker
17108,well destroy davros and you destroy the daleks
17109,its your only chance will you do it
17110,good girl im going to try and get back into the bunker now
17111,good luck      mutos pounce on the doctor one lift a large rock to hit him with when he is tackled by harry sevrin scared off the others
17112,harry
17113,sarah i can hardly believe it
17114,i thought you were in the kaled dome when it was hit
17115,you were absolutely right harry its vital we go back into the bunker
17116,the bracelet that the time lord gave me is our lifeline without it we can never escape from this planet
17117,sevrin would you do something for us something important
17118,over in the kaled trenches theres a thal a girl named bettan shes trying to form a resistance group join her with as many of your own people as you can get their idea is to knock out the bunker
17119,itll keep the elites troops occupied while i try to find a weakness of the daleks
17120,oh just one of davros experiments wed better stick close together
17121,not much further the entrance to the ventilation duct must be just through here
17122,look out harry
17123,theyre not very fast
17124,come on were there
17125,really
17126,that is nasty better not tell harry hes gone first
17127,you were right sarah about there being something nasty waiting for us
17128,i imagine it had never been programmed for such a concept
17129,to stop the development of the daleks
17130,because having lived in what you would call the future i have seen the carnage and destruction they have caused
17131,yes as weapons of hate and machines of war
17132,but theres still time to change all that why not make them a force for good throughout the universe
17133,then do it be remembered for that
17134,many times ive fought against them
17135,not always they have been defeated but never utterly defeated the dalek menace always remains
17136,misfortune lack of information sometimes overwhelming opposition
17137,no davros that is a question that the future must keep secret
17138,no
17139,no i will not
17140,and if i do lie
17141,davros if i tell you what you want to know i betray millions of people in the future i cant do that
17142,all right all right just leave them alone
17143,i have betrayed the future davros for the last time consider what youre doing stop the development of the daleks
17144,its not the machines its the minds of the creatures inside them minds that you created they are totally evil
17145,davros if you had created a virus in your laboratory something contagious and infectious that killed on contact a virus that would destroy all other forms of life would you allow its use
17146,would you do it
17147,but would you do it
17148,no davros
17149,why not
17150,order the destruction of the incubator section
17151,i mean it davros next time i press that switch it stays pressed now give the order
17152,ill take that chance now give the order
17153,tell them the order cannot be countermanded
17154,no wait wait davros knows what youre planning i heard him talking to nyder
17155,no its not that i dont know what hes got prepared for you but believe me hes ready
17156,just be careful be careful
17157,no there isnt weve got to recover that time ring
17158,its on the desk in the main laboratory and then theres that tape recording that nyder took weve got to get it back at all costs it would make the daleks invincible come on
17159,shush
17160,yes explosives and detonators it seems almost providential
17161,the time lord gave me three options theres only one still open genocide
17162,yes im going to kill everything in the incubation room im going to destroy the daleks forever
17163,the flesh and blood part of them indeed they are flesh and blood
17164,press the button
17165,theyre harmless enough i think just unpleasant
17166,theres no need harry it just remains to put the charges where theyll do the most damage it shouldnt take me more than a couple of minutes
17167,sarah
17168,just touch these two strands together and the daleks are finished have i that right
17169,well i do you see some things could be better with the daleks many future worlds will become allies just because of their fear of the daleks
17170,but the final responsibility is mine and mine alone listen if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives could you then kill that child
17171,do i have the right simply touch one wire against the other and thats it the daleks cease to exist hundreds of millions of people thousands of generations can live without fear in peace and never even know the word dalek
17172,but i kill wipe out a whole intelligent lifeform then i become like them id be no better than the daleks
17173,hes going to put a case
17174,im grateful to you gharman more grateful than i can tell you
17175,yes
17176,what
17177,weve got to find that time ring
17178,good girl sarah now all we need is the tape recording so keep an eye on nyder
17179,now i wonder where nyders going at such a crucial moment
17180,so do i lets go
17181,now where are you going in such a hurry
17182,oh somehow that just doesnt ring true
17183,now thats a good question do you have a good answer evidently not well then lets try something else that tape recording you took where is it
17184,shall we go and see
17185,now be reasonable and open it for us
17186,oh no no on the contrary now davros cant rise from his chair correct
17187,and he has the use of only one hand this hand  and davros never goes anywhere without you nyder so you must open the safe for him open it for us
17188,how very apt a dalek gun
17189,weve got the time ring weve destroyed the tape and davros power is broken
17190,oh i think we can leave gharman to destroy them
17191,yes all weve got to do is touch the time ring
17192,even the sonic screwdriver wont open this door
17193,huh
17194,who knows its out of character for davros to submit quite so easily
17195,give me a moment to find the time ring
17196,sarah take this
17197,im going back to the incubator room this time im going to blow it up
17198,no get out of here hurry now go on
17199,yes with a little help from a dalek but im afraid ive only delayed them for a short time perhaps a thousand years
17200,in the total time scale no more than that
17201,sevrin
17202,goodbye thank you
17203,of course weve made it did you think we wouldnt
17204,theres really nothing that can go wrong with a time ring except a molecular short circuit
17205,yes
17206,well it probably hasnt arrived yet were a little early
17207,no you see the tardis is drifting back through time harry we just have to wait for it to turn up
17208,what that
17209,no
17210,well you take good care of it harry
17211,how long
17212,sterile atmosphere
17213,he wouldnt have been left there for two weeks unless
17214,unless there was something seriously wrong here come on
17215,the controls locked
17216,those poor fellows couldnt they were trapped in the after end and left to die whatever did it might be on the other side of this door there might be a way of opening it
17217,well of course it doesnt this is a different point in time
17218,some of that equipment this is probably a beacon put in orbit to service and guide space freighters
17219,thousands of years before harry
17220,all you have to remember is that this is where we parted company with the tardis
17221,if theyve changed things round the tardis might materialise in the forward control rooms
17222,yes i think so if you two could put your weight on the door and stop it opening too suddenly dont want to lose my arm im rather attached to it its so handy
17223,yes
17224,thank you
17225,no this is the forward control room
17226,no but the time ring is designed with a slight safety margin we can expect it to arrive soon    harry
17227,im the doctor this is sarah jane smith harry sullivan were travellers
17228,what are you going to do
17229,the mans sick he needs treatment
17230,sorry gentlemen i cant allow it
17231,my colleague is a doctor of medicine and im a doctor of many things if we could examine
17232,whos the homicidal maniac
17233,yes were from earth we want to help you
17234,i dont believe youve got the plague here commander
17235,did they identify it
17236,well now youve got a new medical team well commander
17237,thank you
17238,whats it called
17239,voga of course has he been down there
17240,voga voga planet of gold yes its all coming back to me now
17241,cybermen thats what were up against commander cybermen
17242,they disappeared after their attack on voga at the end of the cyber war not the same thing as dying out commander theyre utterly ruthless total machine creatures
17243,yes just as i thought
17244,yes like a snake bite
17245,hes been injected with poison
17246,if only id been quicker i might have saved him
17247,the matter beam disperses human molecules that type of alien poison might be separated and rejected
17248,i smell a rat
17249,gold
17250,sarah
17251,that cybermats happened harry quick into the transmat beam quickly as you can its the only way to get the poison out of her system
17252,no sir thats your socalled plague commander
17253,not any more but there are bound to be others around
17254,ill set the beam for voga do you know how to work the reciprocator
17255,off you go no time to lose
17256,sabotage
17257,someones taken the pentalium drive
17258,who removed the tape from your radio log who used cybermats to murder your crew and whos desperate to break all communication between this beacon and voga    stevenson
17259,i know harry i know
17260,there isnt time to wire this in ill have to hold it in position ready
17261,voga otherwise known as the planet of gold is hated and feared by cybermen because gold is lethal to them
17262,its the perfect noncorrodible metal it plates their breathing apparatus and in effect suffocates them doesnt it professor now sarah and harry are down there and without that pentalium drive i cant bring them back
17263,yes keeps in touch with his masters what have you done with the pentalium drive professor
17264,i think hes lying
17265,this oh nothing why is it important
17266,yes i think our friend is lying to gain time
17267,but time for what i wonder
17268,leave it dont shoot commander
17269,after youve been bitten kellman youll have just ten seconds to remember where that pentalium drive is if you want to live
17270,splendid
17271,strange
17272,yes full power they must have left the receptor circle  lester
17273,weve got to stop them getting in
17274,no good
17275,whats your cut kellman vogas gold
17276,oh really
17277,isnt it wonderful to feel needed commander
17278,what great rewards have you promised kellman
17279,everythings of interest to me and cybermen possess nothing that a human might want
17280,then what is it youve no home planet no influence nothing youre just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers skulking about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship
17281,no i dont think so somehow you tried that once and you were nearly wiped out
17282,it was a glorious triumph for human ingenuity they discovered your weakness and invented the glitter gun and that was the end of cybermen except as goldplated souvenirs that people use as hat stands
17283,oh theres to be a second campaign is there
17284,loose thinking the trouble with cybermen is theyve got hydraulic muscles and of course hydraulic brains to go with them
17285,thank you now if im correct about what this contains and should accidentally drop it
17286,your puppet dictator
17287,yes and their use was banned by the armageddon convention
17288,fragmatise oh well i suppose we cant expect decent english from a machine
17289,and when we reach the centre of voga well be fragmatised as you put it
17290,anything else before we go
17291,thank you
17292,careful careful i might explode
17293,yes its the only thing thats effective against cybermen
17294,not a word of it once weve reached the explosive zone well have outlived our usefulness
17295,keep moving give their radar scope something to follow
17296,i think my ideas better
17297,i dont know yet thats the trouble with ideas they only come a bit at a time
17298,steady
17299,well rest for a moment
17300,the deeper we go the heavier the concentration of gold before long it must start affecting their radar picture
17301,well its an outside chance but if we can get back without being detected and take the cybermen from behind all right now commander
17302,lets go
17303,sit down a moment actually i think were very near the centre now this is pretty well solid gold
17304,look out get back
17305,harry were you trying to undo this
17306,did you make the rocks fall harry
17307,harry sullivan is an imbecile
17308,what
17309,harry im not with you
17310,yes
17311,listen listen listen commander if you were to keep on going towards the centre you could draw the radar track away from the rest of us
17312,meantime lester and i could take the cross shaft and attack the cybermen from the rear
17313,gold plain oldfashioned gold
17314,good luck commander
17315,come on
17316,how much have we got
17317,i know weve got five minutes i mean how much gold dust have we got
17318,youve got it harry come on
17319,there they are wait till i give the signal
17320,well im impressed
17321,oh please dont call me human just doctor will do very nicely thank you is that your rocket
17322,er before you do anything rash like pressing another button may i make an alternative suggestion
17323,let me take the transmat back to the beacon and deal with the cybermen myself
17324,give me just fifteen minutes if at the end of that time i havent come through on the radio well then you can fire off your rocket
17325,ive a young friend on the beacon sarah jane the girl who was here she risked her life to save mine the least i can do is accept the same risk for her
17326,just fifteen minutes is that so intolerable
17327,thank you tyram theres just one other thing i need
17328,a bag of gold dust
17329,thank you harry
17330,while im gone youd better find the commander
17331,shush
17332,you havent seen anything of the tardis have you
17333,are they and weve got about nine minutes before the vogans aim their rocket at us get the control box well see what we can do
17334,yes
17335,is it
17336,oh right come on quickly then
17337,just you wait and see
17338,theyve started the engines
17339,come on lets hide
17340,looks like it
17341,dusty death out out with
17342,what
17343,all right all right all right youve made your point we surrender we surrender
17344,bye bye
17345,nice sense of irony i thought for a moment he was going to smile
17346,judging by the speed at which the rocket is approaching two or three minutes
17347,yes thats right
17348,hmm i used to untangle turks head eyesplice with the grommets i picked up from houdini it should work
17349,good girl that rockets getting too close for comfort
17350,commander  stevenson
17351,i think therefore it missed
17352,oh yes oh no theyve locked the gyro controls the flight trimmers are jammed
17353,it means were heading for the biggest bang in history
17354,hang on if i pull her back at this speed shell break in half
17355,i think ill just set the drift compensators we dont want it slipping through our fingers
17356,dont just stand there come on
17357,im needed back on earth
17358,i left the brigadier a spacetime telegraph system and told him not to use it unless he had a real emergency on his hands
17359,he has come on you two
17360,halt
17361,good morning
17362,i want to know one thing brigadier whats that
17363,suits you very well
17364,yes
17365,a man of convictions
17366,brigadier why have you called me back i hope youve got a very good reason
17367,brigadier brigadier have you brought me two hundred and seventy million miles just to sort out a little trouble at sea
17368,when i left the psionic beam with you brigadier i said it was only to be used in an emergency
17369,oil an emergency huh its about time the people who run this planet of yours realised that to be dependent upon a mineral slime just doesnt make sense now the energising of hydrogen
17370,no very well when do we start
17371,yes so was the bismarck and we all know that story
17372,you say these radio blackouts have happened before
17373,and no strange craft in the area nothing suspicious
17374,it may be calm but its never empty     mc
17375,hmm
17376,you know what he was playing flowers of the forest a lament for the dead
17377,its part of the radio probe system used for checking localised jamming
17378,has he said anything
17379,what nothing at all
17380,harry harry can you hear me harry its the doctor can you hear me
17381,no hes not hes got a scalp wound he should be all right but he needs time
17382,what
17383,same pattern
17384,ill come back with you
17385,good girl
17386,whats that
17387,mister benton nip into the sickbay will you and fetch some plaster of paris
17388,paris theyll have some to spare
17389,how very curious
17390,a little experiment in orthodontology mister huckle
17391,teeth teeth the scientific study of teeth
17392,teeth are very serious things mister huckle
17393,yes a set of giant molars that can chew through solid steel as easily as paper
17394,she says hes recovering good good has he said anything
17395,no no ill be right over and sarah     doctor
17396,sarah
17397,and no miss smith
17398,mister benton
17399,get some men over here and search the area
17400,he might be wandering on the moors wheres the telephone
17401,no one else on duty
17402,where does this lead
17403,ah
17404,shush its only me its only me
17405,i dont know but thats not the air conditioning
17406,shut up and save your breath
17407,keep looking into my eyes keep looking into my eyes you dont need to breathe do not breathe do not breathe you feel no pain no pain you feel nothing you understand nothing you feel nothing
17408,it worked mister benton
17409,why are you whispering
17410,oh just a trick i picked up from a tibetan monk dont touch her it could be fatal to break the spell incorrectly
17411,gassed
17412,yes some kind of nerve gas affects the higher consciousness
17413,oh yes
17414,yes it does someone or something wanted to pass this way unseen you still on duty mister benton
17415,then get outside and scout around
17416,if one of these was clamped to each of the rigs about to be attacked ah perhaps it emits some kind of primeval mating call
17417,if my theory is correct were going to have to handle this very very carefully
17418,no thank you mister huckle this could be very valuable youve done enough thank you
17419,youve been asleep brigadier
17420,something very big and very heavy
17421,yes but how does it work if we knew that at least wed be able to destroy it still thanks to you weve still got it
17422,meaning
17423,yes you know brigadier it does seem as if they know our moves in advance
17424,why not its possible we now know they have the power to turn themselves into facsimile human beings
17425,yes  i think its more likely theyve got some form of electronic surveillance
17426,shush a bug    benton
17427,of course part artefact part organic shes right brigadier
17428,yes
17429,yes
17430,machine guns may not be enough brigadier
17431,theres only one course still open to us ill try and draw it off while you get a fix on its activating signal we must find its base brigadier
17432,it doesnt know how fast i can move          corporal
17433,yes the cyborg overstepped its mark luckily for me
17434,cyborg is a hybrid creature brigadier half animal half machine must be very interesting
17435,no whoevers controlling them did you locate their base
17436,yes it is possible ready brigadier
17437,to visit the duke were going to forgill castle
17438,well theres nobody to announce us is there
17439,my family has served this country for seven centuries but that seems not to count these days ah there you are
17440,nobody opened the front door
17441,yes
17442,brigadier
17443,well tell him
17444,we are very
17445,im not a party to any kind of nonsense your grace
17446,an underground river
17447,i know your grace i know but theres a subterranean channel leading from loch ness to the devils punchbowl a small loch near the village its near the sea and would make a useful back door for the monster wouldnt you say
17448,whenever its ordered to we know its controlled by a signal system
17449,aliens
17450,well it takes all sorts to make a galaxy your grace      mc
17451,yes im saying exactly that
17452,not perhaps yes for hundreds of years the monsters been able to cross tullock moor unseen then the oil company built a base right in its path
17453,causing it to make a detour round the village which is why its masters released nerve gas and why you went to sleep brigadier
17454,well perhaps not in itself maybe but their plans may have changed recently who knows
17455,good task for you sarah
17456,do you mind if my assistant looks through your library
17457,not so sarah you might find a valuable lead i want you to check any reference to mcranald bay and devils punchbowl
17458,obviously he was bug hunting
17459,havent you noticed this is where it was hidden do you see
17460,why not we know that these creatures can change he may not be the real duke
17461,somethings happened
17462,is he
17463,what about you two
17464,its nice to see you does this lead to the spaceship
17465,sounds like the brigadier
17466,going somewhere are we            benton
17467,youve been hiding too long broton its become a habit
17468,i thought the plan was to conquer the world
17469,but you cant rule a world in hiding youve got to come out onto the balcony sometimes and wave a tentacle if youll pardon the expression
17470,half wit
17471,social call
17472,well im not human and ive seen better
17473,very good very good almost impressive but why bother
17474,ah so you still have a use for the real duke
17475,formal occasion
17476,i gather weve landed where are we
17477,well its the only way to learn when does this great operation begin this conquest of the world
17478,and what are you going to do with it when youve got it isnt it a bit large for just about six of you
17479,hmm and theyre coming here at your invitation
17480,ill say one thing for you broton you think big
17481,using forced labour
17482,youre underestimating human beings broton
17483,right now for the big question is half power lethal
17484,im alive
17485,his grace the duke of forgill i presume
17486,on a spaceship
17487,weve got to lure the zygons out of the control room somehow this is also a fire sensor if i can heat it sufficiently
17488,yes that one man get on with it
17489,its more than enough
17490,i will its a selfdestructor and it works like this
17491,everyone get down
17492,was that bang big enough for you brigadier
17493,not entirely broton escaped and he still has control of the monster he plans to attack some target in london
17494,exactly and this time itll be something really spectacular
17495,whats happening there
17496,ah that could be it brigadier
17497,well come on lets get to london
17498,well he was checked into the building whats behind the conference hall
17499,you search there sarah and i will take the cellar
17500,stay there    broton
17501,the signal device quickly brotons hidden it in this room somewhere brigadier evacuate the building the monster will tear the place down to get the device
17502,quiet both of you listen i can almost feel it
17503,here boy fetch it fetch it
17504,hes chewing it
17505,hell go home now hes eaten the device
17506,loch ness harry the only home he knows
17507,my contraption your grace is this way i think follow me come on
17508,yes thats the tardis and im going to pilot it all the way to london i can be there five minutes ago
17509,of course i can coming
17510,sarah
17511,no
17512,oh yes we will i promise
17513,hmm what did you say
17514,did i
17515,wriggle out of what
17516,listen were on the edge of a timespace vortex and youre talking in minutes
17517,nothing nothing at all what makes you think somethings gone wrong
17518,nothing of consequence slight overshoot easily rectified
17519,weve come out of the time vortex at the wrong point thats all a few years too late
17520,thirty thousand
17521,someones in trouble
17522,who knows stand by for emergency materialisation
17523,this way
17524,oh with any luck were near enough to reach wherever it is
17525,before whatever it was that made them transmit the call overwhelms them that is if were not too late already
17526,oh its a weak signal allowing for the fact of interference from the time warp could you move any faster
17527,sarah you all right whats the matter
17528,are you all right now
17529,you look all right
17530,hand tool of some kind
17531,several months too late by the look of him
17532,probably the powers run down
17533,yes ah
17534,automatic distress button it all adds up may have been running for months high capacity power cell dependant for sunlight on charging
17535,were still in a solar system but what particular star provides the light and energy wherever we are were a long way out
17536,hmm well this is clearly the base for some kind of scientific expedition possibly geological something went wrong and they sent out a distress signal
17537,yes something like that a lost expedition
17538,so lets go back to the tardis and fetch my spectromixer and ill fix our position by that star then ill repair this power cell and try and make contact
17539,good idea would you do that
17540,good thinking what are you waiting for
17541,oh
17542,sarah
17543,hes dead
17544,perhaps my receivers are better than yours
17545,my manners certainly are    vishinsky
17546,discomfort you mean youre going to torture me
17547,how
17548,theyre magnetically locked
17549,all right sarah i think its gone are you all right whats the matter
17550,youve had a very narrow escape
17551,im not sure yet but ive got a very unpleasant theory
17552,just hang on
17553,nothing
17554,shush listen its coming this way
17555,fortunately time is on our side
17556,yes nights candles are burned out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain top or something like that   targetblankromeo  juliet act 3 scene
17557,thats what shakespeare meant
17558,that is the question
17559,some sort of surveillance device
17560,no i met him once you know
17561,shakespeare charming fellow dreadful actor
17562,perhaps it was
17563,yes this is it
17564,no it doesnt live anywhere it just is
17565,never mind about that look down there what do you see
17566,look into it wouldnt you expect to see a reflection
17567,i can empty my own pockets thank you
17568,ive nothing up my sleeve if thats what you mean
17569,get back didnt you learn anything youre tampering with the balance of nature on this planet in ways you dont understand it may already be too late
17570,prisoners were here to help were not prisoners
17571,not guilty
17572,do you have any idea of what youre up against on this planet
17573,if you wont allow us
17574,thank you
17575,we had nothing to do with those deaths they were brought about by your intrusion listen now listen to me please here on zeta minor is the boundary between existence as you know it and the other universe which you just dont understand
17576,yes from the beginning of time it has existed side by side with the known universe each is the antithesis of the other you call it nothing a word to cover ignorance then centuries ago scientists invented another word for it antimatter they called it
17577,and you by coming here have crossed the boundary into that other universe to plunder it dangerous
17578,mineral samples sorenson you cant take any part of this planet with you
17579,but you cant
17580,sorenson if you dont listen to me youll never leave this planet
17581,frequently
17582,no no its tempting to let them go ahead and destroy themselves the trouble is they wouldnt be the only ones
17583,cataclysm
17584,yes the end of the universe
17585,do you remember the rocks around the pool
17586,this is a concentrated form
17587,its just an idea
17588,fools do they really think theyll be allowed to leave with this on board
17589,youve sent those men to their deaths use the forcefield barrier
17590,then link it to the atomic accelerator
17591,link the forcefield to the atomic accelerator
17592,sorenson youre a scientist surely you appreciate the dangers of moving material from one dimension to another
17593,youre tampering with hideously dangerous forces
17594,yes for the moment but while those mineral samples remain on board itll always come back
17595,unless you abandon those canisters yes
17596,why
17597,im afraid that isnt the solution you must find an alternative energy source
17598,as long as your intention to leave as you came emptyhanded is made clear
17599,through me im not entirely without influence but it will take time
17600,alone i must go alone
17601,yes i know ill take care
17602,no
17603,sarah vandervelts equation of knowledge quite wrong
17604,whats the noise
17605,what but the canisters i promised
17606,its difficult to explain
17607,i communicated
17608,except for this
17609,antimatter how else do you think i survived that pool
17610,yes
17611,then i suggest you search the ship
17612,because there must still be antimatter aboard its the only explanation
17613,if were not vapourised first
17614,antimatter in collision with matter causes radiation annihilation a release of energy more powerful than nuclear fission
17615,and i tell you there is
17616,well
17617,i wonder
17618,can i see the printout
17619,vishinsky id like a medical check on everybody aboard the ship
17620,because someone is contaminated
17621,why
17622,what is all this
17623,why for what reason
17624,professor sorenson has it ever occurred to you that you might be mistaken that there is no practical method of exploiting antiquark energy
17625,the answers really very simple youve come to the end of your piece of elastic
17626,it wont stretch any further in fact very soon it will start to pull you back
17627,antimatter can theres still some aboard and this proves it
17628,yes faster and faster until of course we reach the surface then well stop with a bang the only way to prevent it is to find the antimatter
17629,salamar youre wrong again
17630,usually i only entertain friends in the tardis
17631,externally as you can see it resembles a london police box
17632,sarah what happened
17633,antiman
17634,a hybrid creature running amok
17635,oh now listen sa
17636,whereve they gone
17637,what
17638,you what
17639,who was with you
17640,sorenson of course the sole survivor of the expedition
17641,yes hes been infected with antimatter his brain cells are being destroyed hell descend to the level of a brute sarah
17642,get to command deck tell them to shut down all the hatches our only chance is to keep it isolated
17643,do as i say
17644,keep away
17645,keep away
17646,professor sorenson youre ill
17647,you think youve discovered an oral vaccine to protect you against antiquark penetration but youre wrong
17648,for a time but it set up a cycle of chemical change theres no way back sorenson youve reached the point where your tissues are so monstrously hybridised that the next metabolic change could be the final one
17649,there isnt much time
17650,you and i are scientists professor we buy our privilege to experiment at the cost of total responsibility
17651,listen vishinsky listen there are now two forces of antimatter aboard ive got one and the other one is sorenson himself
17652,hes got to be stopped how long to impact  vishinsky
17653,where are you salamar dont use the accelerator salamar    doctor
17654,shut down all the hatchways it may hold them
17655,yes them theyve multiplied
17656,duplicates of sorenson pure antimatter the neutron accelerator boosted its power and the creatures split off and multiplied
17657,stay here with vishinsky sarah im going out now and i may be some time
17658,sorenson sorenson
17659,sorenson professor sorenson
17660,yes because i kept my promise and returned the antimatter
17661,dont you worry professor just rest a while everythings going to be all right
17662,no no no professor i think youd abandoned that line youd decided to concentrate on deriving energy from the kinetic force of planetary movement
17663,yes large source of untapped energy there
17664,goodbye vishinsky come on sarah weve an appointment in london and were already thirty thousand years late  ltback to the episode listing
17665,hello vicky
17666,hmm where did you get that dress
17667,yes yes i always did victoria wore it she travelled with me for a time
17668,the earth isnt my home sarah im a time lord
17669,you dont understand the implications im not a human being i walk in eternity
17670,it means ive lived for something like seven hundred and fifty years
17671,yes about time i found something better to do than run around after the brigadier
17672,the relative continuum stabiliser failed
17673,what thing
17674,nothing can enter the tardis unless
17675,mental projection of that force is beyond imagination yet it might explain the stabiliser failure lets see was it at this end of the spectrum
17676,weve landed
17677,weve materialised at the correct point in space but obviously not in time a temporal reverse some vast impulse of energy has drawn the tardis off course
17678,yes
17679,it must be the old priory the unit house was built on the site
17680,somethings very wrong
17681,somethings going on contrary to the laws of the universe i must find out what
17682,that isnt all must sarah some of its mummy french picklock never fails belonged to marie antoinette charming lady lost her head poor thing
17683,through the window i understood the property was for sale no
17684,did we
17685,egyptian eh is this where he keeps his relatives
17686,what are you afraid of
17687,i see in that case wed better leave
17688,as you wish
17689,dont worry ill remember      warlock
17690,you must were sitting ducks if we stay here
17691,laurence
17692,he needs help sarah you go on ahead find the lodge
17693,ill be all right
17694,hell be all right if we can staunch the bleeding
17695,mummies are embalmed eviscerated corpses they dont walk
17696,never mind about that now
17697,no this is much too grave a matter for the police mister scarman
17698,yes theyd only hamper my investigation
17699,yes why do you think im here somethings interfering with time mister scarman and time is my business
17700,interesting contraption
17701,yes so i see what year is this
17702,its a simple enough question surely
17703,if i knew i wouldnt ask dont be obtuse man
17704,ah splendid an excellent year one of my favourites yes i really must congratulate you mister scarman
17705,inventing the radio telescope forty years early
17706,is to receive radio emissions from the stars
17707,well you see mister scarman i have the advantage of being slightly ahead of you sometimes behind you but normally ahead of you
17708,im sure you dont but its very nice of you to try now why dont you show me how this gadget works
17709,please just a little demonstration
17710,fascinating a regular pattern repeated over and over again
17711,i wonder where was your aerial tuned
17712,i just thought id verify the signal
17713,well in principle its exactly the same as the gadget youve invented only less cumbersome yes it is the same signal obviously automatic well if its a message it shouldnt be difficult to decipher theyd want to make it easy
17714,now lets see this pattern recurs three times in one line lets call that e the commonest letter in the language
17715,better known to you as set
17716,if im right the world is facing the greatest peril in its history
17717,no the forces that are being summoned into corporeal existence in that house are more powerful and more dangerous than anything even i have ever encountered stay here
17718,i never carry firearms
17719,shush
17720,to set up a deflection field around the house hes obviously planned every step
17721,no sutekh
17722,he destroyed his own planet phaester osiris and left a trail of havoc across half the galaxy horus and the rest of the osirans must have finally cornered him on earth
17723,the wars of the gods entered into mythology the whole of egyptian culture is founded upon the osiran pattern
17724,ah found it
17725,the lodestone that drew the tardis off course
17726,no it isnt its the entrance to a timespace tunnel
17727,to sutekh          laurence
17728,a parallax coil
17729,i never expected that a simple trap blew up in my face clever
17730,never underestimate sutekh thinks of everything
17731,where
17732,in a victorian gothic folly nonsense
17733,if only i knew the exact physical location of sutekh where was your brothers expedition bound
17734,saqqara too vague yet it might be our only chance
17735,sutekh is controlling operations here by mental force with the equipment at the lodge i could transmit a jamming signal
17736,with an etheric impulse projected along precisely the right axis yes otherwise
17737,the egyptians ring
17738,its a slave relay calculating the reverse polarisation should be childs play why didnt i think of it
17739,all right all clear
17740,shush to find that egyptian
17741,im not sure yet
17742,youre right yes thats resonating tuner part of an antigravity drive oh they must be building a rocket
17743,theyre not mummies theyre service robots
17744,machines
17745,so that sutekh can escape from the power of horus
17746,exactly where horus left him seven thousand years ago trapped beneath a pyramid and powerless to move
17747,youre going to say it transcends all the normal laws of physics
17748,isnt it i often think dimensional transcendentalism is preposterous but it works would you like to look around
17749,please
17750,i cant
17751,because if sutekh isnt stopped hell destroy the world
17752,do we
17753,all right if we leave now lets see what the world will look like in 1980
17754,1980 sarah if you want to get off
17755,no thats the world as sutekh would leave it a desolate planet circling a dead sun
17756,every point in time has its alternative sarah youve looked into alternative time
17757,not chosen shaped the actions of the present fashion the future
17758,to a small extent it takes a being of sutekhs almost limitless power to destroy the future well
17759,yes
17760,well if you can stop thinking of him as your brother itll make it a great deal easier for you
17761,from the moment he entered sutekhs tomb he became subject to sutekhs will
17762,as a human being marcus scarman no longer exists he is simply the embodiment of sutekhs power hes given the paralysed sutekh arms and legs a means to escape
17763,its against their code to have killed him would have meant that they were no better than he so they simply imprisoned him
17764,a forcefield controlled from a power source on mars
17765,yes thats where the signal was beamed from remember
17766,when your brother stumbled into sutekhs tomb the monitoring system on mars detected the fact and triggered off an alarm signal
17767,yes will be aimed at the power source on mars if those warheads reach their target sutekh will have released himself
17768,not only this world anywhere that life is found right all i need now is a magneto
17769,if i can block the mental beam scarman will collapse
17770,well hes not alive now in any real sense only sutekh animates him deprived of his outside contact sutekhll be as powerless as the day horus left him
17771,splendid
17772,quick sarah switch on the power
17773,switch on
17774,the ring sarah use the ring
17775,return to control
17776,are you all right
17777,you dont deserve to be you nearly got us all killed
17778,whats worse youve probably wrecked what was my only chance of stopping sutekh
17779,listen whats walking about out there is no longer your brother it is simply an animated human cadaver animated by sutekh do you understand  and if sutekh succeeds in freeing himself the consequences will be incalculable stay here
17780,its an osiran war missile and almost complete by the look of it
17781,it transposes with its projection pyramid power
17782,cytronic induction
17783,the robots are drawing their energy from a cytronic particle accelerator which must be in sutekhs tomb
17784,so put that out of action and hed have no workforce
17785,scarman came here through the timespace tunnel its a twoway mechanism
17786,no it wouldnt if i go after sutekh sutekh will kill me the missiles are aimed wouldnt what be better
17787,with what
17788,do you have some
17789,clements
17790,where did he keep it
17791,lets go sarah
17792,no well find it
17793,mister scarman if you want to help start getting the bindings off that robot
17794,ah there we are now all weve got to do is find the door
17795,no not really
17796,no obvious booby traps are you going to help or are you just going to stand there and admire the scenery
17797,just hold the base i dont want it to fall
17798,very dangerous
17799,yes just let me know if it starts to get warm
17800,just to make sure come on
17801,hes allpowerful if he ever gets free there isnt a lifeform in the galaxy that could stand against him
17802,not even our lot
17803,could be
17804,ah
17805,sweaty gelignite is highly unstable one good sneeze could set it off
17806,no sign of any detonators or fuses
17807,it should be safe there for the moment  sarah
17808,strangled
17809,not this time there are marks his late brother must have called
17810,i told him not to be i told him it was too late
17811,human typical osiran simplicity
17812,four men sarah five if you include professor scarman himself and theyre merely the first of millions unless sutekh is stopped know thine enemy admirable advice
17813,if were going to do anything about that missile were going to have to move quickly ill need your help
17814,these bindings are chemically impregnated to protect the robots against damage and corrosion an impenetrable disguise wouldnt you say
17815,hurry up
17816,it doesnt have to be perfect i shall mingle with the mummies but i shant linger
17817,how do i look
17818,dont provoke me come on and dont forget the rifle
17819,you know what to do
17820,make sure you shoot straight you wont get a second shot
17821,you did sutekh is containing the explosion
17822,mental power theres only one hope left ive got to get to him break his concentration      sutekh
17823,sutekh last of the osirans
17824,just destroy me sutekh nothing else now is left within your power
17825,im a traveller
17826,gallifrey in the constellation of kasterborus
17827,ten zero eleven zero zero by zero two
17828,i renounced the society of the time lords now im simply a traveller
17829,yes yes
17830,doctor
17831,serve you sutekh your name is abominated in every civilised world whether that name be set satan sodos
17832,never argh
17833,no
17834,sarah
17835,all sapient lifeforms are our kith sutekh
17836,because you fear that other intelligent lifeforms may grow to rival you in power so you kill all life wherever you find it
17837,if you can do that by mental force sutekh then nothing can be beyond you
17838,you use your powers for evil
17839,then i curse you sutekh in the name of all nature you are a twisted abhorrence argh
17840,the controls of the tardis are isomorphic
17841,yes
17842,master
17843,sutekh
17844,sutekh
17845,sutekh
17846,sutekh is supreme
17847,youre soaking my shirt
17848,respiratory bypass system useful in a tight squeeze where are we
17849,of course sutekh sent scarman here to deactivate the pyramid where is he
17850,sutekh didnt need me any more so he relaxed his grip now did you see where scarman went
17851,it cant have vanished its just not visible
17852,scarman must be stopped somehow he must be stopped
17853,yes
17854,thats too obvious
17855,that is
17856,not in a jail horus would have laid traps for the unwary
17857,he was an osiran with all their guile and ingenuity ah
17858,yes and theres a key
17859,yes obviously the length of the lines provide a scale of measurement
17860,dont touch anything
17861,well dont one false move and we could be blown to perdition feet and inches one side metres and centimetres the other lets see
17862,hundred and sixty two point four thats about seven stitches
17863,i cant do it i cant do it  horus
17864,no the time factor
17865,come on run
17866,weve got about twenty seconds here he comes
17867,youre caught in a temporal trap sutekh
17868,how long do osirans live sutekh
17869,never youre caught in the corridor of eternity
17870,youre a thousand years beyond the twentieth century now sutekh go on for another ten thousand
17871,no sutekh the time of the osirans is long past
17872,go he lived about seven thousand years
17873,at last
17874,i moved the threshold of the time space tunnel into the far future he could never have reached the end after the eye was broken i realised that we had little more than two minutes to get back here
17875,the time radio waves take to pass from mars to earth
17876,yes you know the egyptians called him the typhonian beast
17877,that was careless of me i forgot the thermal balance would equalise
17878,yes perhaps it is time we were leaving we dont want to be blamed for starting a fire do we
17879,i had enough of that in 1666
17880,come on come on    ltback to the episode listing
17881,well the coordinates were set for your time but the linear calculator well ginger pop
17882,i really must get the tardis seen to shes way overdue her five hundred year service
17883,yes it does have that peculiar earthy smell which is odd when you look at the ground
17884,its bone dry cant have been any rain here for more than a week
17885,some enormous release of energy
17886,well unless someones started exporting acorns oak trees dont grow anywhere else in the galaxy
17887,eenie meenie minie mo
17888,i told you to watch the bramble
17889,nothing it could just as easily have be fum fo fee fi
17890,lets hope theyre not strangers here themselves hello there
17891,what please excuse me could you be very kind and tell me where we are
17892,sarah dont look down
17893,my pleasure couldnt leave you hanging around in a place like this
17894,look at these
17895,freshly minted no scratches tarnish
17896,what are the odds against finding a pocket full of coins all dated the same
17897,no nor do i yet
17898,no no shush wait wait ive seen something like this before my memorys getting terrible you know three hundred years ago id have recognised this like a shot
17899,keep down
17900,hmm
17901,do you know it
17902,its a bit quiet

17907,here it is again
17908,freshly minted money all the same year sarah
17909,what was that story you came here on
17910,is it if weve landed in a prohibited area then those people who shot at us were possibly guards
17911,protective clothing some kind of radioactivity remember i detected an energy source the soldier who went over the cliff was possibly affected by it
17912,something like that
17913,evacuated
17914,if some dangerous substance leaked it would be an emergency
17915,its only a speculation
17916,contamination precaution money changes hands in a place like this it might be necessary to bring in clean currency every few months
17917,huh
17918,thats impossible
17919,wait
17920,come on
17921,i havent the faintest idea but i intend to find out
17922,space defence station i could contact unit from there you stay here and keep an eye on things
17923,youll be all right
17924,can you find your way back to the tardis
17925,right if anything goes wrong meet me there

17928,oh i dropped in you know i do from time to time
17929,youre getting it
17930,i just wondered youre in someone elses office it says brigadier lethbridge stewart on the door
17931,mmm im his unpaid scientific advisor
17932,yes
17933,good who are you
17934,well how do you do
17935,look ive got a suggestion my arms are beginning to ache why not call lethbridge stewart and get him to identify me

17938,is that finger loaded
17939,ask me later come on

17942,how
17943,well well well its a small world
17944,benton
17945,come on
17946,the further they spread out the better our chance of escape  crayford
17947,that improves our chances
17948,lead by a dead man fascinating
17949,how do you know crayfords dead
17950,i dont think crayford died in space when he finally got back here something returned with him
17951,something thats controlling every human being for miles around
17952,yes come on
17953,back to the village weve got to warn london
17954,tracker dogs

17965,ginger beer
17966,well yes and no or no and yes so to speak as it were do you get much custom from there

17980,what do you mean not the real harry
17981,who are
17982,shush
17983,how did you get away
17984,and you were lucky enough to find this place and the only telephone in the place that worked
17985,i think they let you make that telephone call
17986,i mean were being tested they want to find out how smart we are
17987,of course its that what i dont understand is if theyre so advanced in technology theyve made facsimile human beings good enough to stand face to face examination and sent them through a space time warp to earth what can they be afraid of they must possess the weaponry to take the earth by force theyve created a bridgehead by stealth using androids fake humans come on
17988,well theres a radio in the tardis are you coming
17989,lets go
17990,yes well this is the oak tree this is where we landed
17991,its not programmed to autooperate theres a fail safe unless
17992,of course i know youve still got a tardis key havent you
17993,you havent lost it you never had it sarah came here turned the key in the lock and cancelled the pause control the tardis continued on its set coordinates back to earth
17994,yes you do this isnt earth this isnt real wood its some kind of artificial material like plastic these are not real trees and youre not the real sarah
17995,i knew at once you see the real sarah wasnt wearing her scarf
17996,oh hello
17997,look here we havent been introduced have we
17998,well well well an md bomb
17999,youre really enjoying this arent you
18000,im not just sitting here im tied up
18001,knife in my right hand pocket
18002,of course its their artificial ivy try the sonic screwdriver set it to theta omega
18003,a bit close
18004,styggron whos styggron
18005,i prefer our harry     kraal
18006,harry and benton and the rest are not the real thing
18007,fakes copies electronic androids with well programmed computers instead of brains
18008,if id had my wits around me id have known it from the start remember that high level of radiation id noticed when we left the tardis
18009,that was natural radiation the kraal planet oseidon is the only planet in the galaxy with a level that high
18010,well its not that bad yet
18011,quite right any level of radiation is too high and its getting worse all the time wont be long before the place becomes uninhabitable thats why the kraals are planning to leave and take over earth
18012,yes
18013,yes and the woods and the defence station every last detail copied down including the inhabitants
18014,well nobodys perfect
18015,well it is impressive but doomed to fail in the end
18016,a normal reentry crayford youve been gone two years assumed dead
18017,a gigantic hoax
18018,but helped by you he couldnt have done it without your knowledge and memory
18019,youve been brainwashed crayford
18020,i see i see tell me if your kraal friends are so unviolent why did styggron try to vaporise me
18021,oh
18022,we have to warn earth
18023,yes i think this has possibilities
18024,well if we can somehow lure that guard in give him a good stiff jolt
18025,well randomise him to be accurate remember hes only a machine
18026,how thoughtful bread and water
18027,careful you androids dont know your own strength
18028,dont worry sarah and dont waste the water remember its an excellent conductor
18029,going somewhere are you
18030,yes well
18031,thats stealing
18032,so you do intend genocide
18033,how do you intend to destroy the humans styggron if you use nuclear weapons youll raise earths radiation level beyond your own point of tolerance
18034,where will you be all this time
18035,the best laid schemes of mice and kraals gang aft agley
18036,something will go wrong styggron
18037,we shall see
18038,i am awake i think
18039,shush shush shush once upon a time there were three sisters and they lived at the bottom of a treacle well their names were olga masha and elena are you listening tilly
18040,what
18041,i feel disorientated
18042,that makes sense
18043,hurry
18044,crayfords ship itll be leaving in a moment right right
18045,were going into that rocket sarah
18046,i said you and i are going into that rocket  chedaki
18047,were on the way
18048,yes you did the gforce cut the blood supply to what you humans laughingly call your higher centres
18049,it was a gentle massage compared to whats ahead
18050,yes you do just before crayford puts the ship into reentry orbit these containers will be shot out like pips from a lemon
18051,through the cargo shuttle ejectors and well be in them
18052,ask me why
18053,because theyll reach earth before the ship theres no other way we can warn the defence station
18054,oh therell be enough to last the few minutes in space im more concerned about the efficiency of these retro tubes
18055,oh i imagine theyll work well enough for the androids to survive impact but we could be in for a nasty jolt
18056,exactly sarah youve put your finger on the one tiny flaw in our plan
18057,well im open to suggestions if youve got a better idea
18058,quite soon theyre beaming us through the space time warp now
18059,sarah sarah no sarah no sarah no sarah        crayford
18060,im sorry i had to be sure you see theres a replica of you around somewhere
18061,the rocket is coming in to land
18062,it would suit our purposes better if no one was warned
18063,can you tell me where i could find the commanding officer
18064,thank you
18065,yes there we are
18066,thank you is this the first time youve seen me today
18067,good now if you do see me again today i want you to report it to me immediately ill be with the co in the scanner room
18068,wheres harry
18069,call him down
18070,call him down
18071,give it to me harry harry can you hear me  harry
18072,good
18073,what controls the angle of your radar dish
18074,give me a pen      benton 2
18075,all right well you get about it
18076,tell no one what youre doing
18077,nothing like the chaos therell be if you dont do it grierson
18078,an invasion of earth is going on colonel
18079,lets go to your office youve got some important phone calls to make crayfords sold you out to the kraals
18080,indeed i have
18081,theyve made replicas of you and harry colonel
18082,yes
18083,yes but it would take too long we can use this
18084,its a robot detector it lights up in the presence of androids
18085,i dont think so i see i was just too late  doctor 2
18086,looks like
18087,they must be up there in the rocket with styggron
18088,our only chance is to stop the androids before they take over the complex
18089,to the scanner room you stay here sarah
18090,come on we havent got a second to lose man     doctor 2
18091,good    doctor 2
18092,he did nothing for you crayford absolutely nothing at all except brainwash you
18093,you were hijacked by the kraals crayford nothing went wrong with your rocket crayford you werent even injured take off the eye patch and look for yourself       harry 2
18094,good
18095,did he
18096,excuse me
18097,dont waste any tears on him sarah hes only an android

18099,come on
18100,are you sure
18101,oh ill make you an offer ill take you home
18102,come out meddlesome interfering idiots i know youre up there so come on out and show yourselves
18103,the time lords who else now you see you see they havent even got the common decency to come out and show their ears
18104,its intolerable i wont stand for any more of it
18105,what
18106,what do you think i dont know the difference between an internal fault and an external influence oh no no no theres something going on here some dirty work they wont touch with their lily white hands well i wont do it do you hear
18107,i dont know and i dont really care
18108,im just going to sit here and do nothing
18109,yes
18110,yes ejection bubble
18111,a space parachute
18112,fancy
18113,ive no idea
18114,no thanks im just going to sit here and practise my double loops
18115,yes
18116,not the crash afterwards
18117,looks as if he escaped in the ejection bubble and while he was wandering around dazed someone or something attacked him poor mutt
18118,yes a mutant insect species widely established in the nebula of cyclops i thought i recognised the stars
18119,i was born in these parts
18120,well within a couple of billion miles yes
18121,can you spare a glass of water
18122,well im glad you like it i have had several i used to have an old grey model before this some people liked it
18123,i said some people liked it but i prefer this model
18124,interesting
18125,karn is it i should have known
18126,oh please please
18127,what made you settle on karn
18128,microsurgical techniques into tissue transplant it was the title of the book you published
18129,one of the foremost neurosurgeons of your time considerably after your time sarah yes your disappearance caused quite a stir it was said by some youd joined the followers of the cult of morbius
18130,or a telekinetic visit
18131,from the sisterhood of karn
18132,i know who that reminds me of now one of the time lords morbius
18133,one of the most despicable criminally minded wretches that ever lived
18134,have i been ill long nurse
18135,hmm sorry matron
18136,no thank you i had a little drink about an hour ago events have moved along while i was asleep
18137,please just call me doctor i hate all this bowing and scraping
18138,confess to what
18139,well i have to confess
18140,that i dont really know the calibrators have been on the blink recently
18141,really what you mean you still practise teleportation how quaint now if you got yourself a decent forklift truck
18142,what do you mean i have but a little time left
18143,but im only seven hundred and forty nine life doesnt begin until seven hundred and
18144,not by me it isnt i havent even been consulted
18145,i havent the vaguest notion of what youre talking about the last thing i remember i was taking a glass of wine with solon and morbius
18146,thats right morbius is dead
18147,solon had a clay model of his head but it was more than that a living mental contact i felt the mind of morbius
18148,i know that but i tell you maren just for a second before i passed out his mind touched mine i felt his burning hatred and anguish morbius is alive
18149,im guilty of nothing
18150,you seem convinced im guilty why is it so important i confess
18151,plotted against you youve got it wrong matron
18152,nevertheless nothing for years the time lords have extended their friendship towards the sisters when morbius and his rebels overran this planet who was it saved you
18153,what do you mean the elixir no longer forms
18154,how can it that flame is the product of gases forcing up along a geological fault from deep in the molten heart of the planet it will burn for millions of years
18155,unless some subterranean movement have you noticed any tremors recently
18156,no wait please please listen
18157,this could be a grave mistake maren if those gases are sealed in this entire mountain could explode remember cotopaxi mount vesuvius what about pompeii surely you remember popocatepetl
18158,take no notice solon im delighted to see you
18159,that music was terrible
18160,hear hear seconded anyone against
18161,im ready maren
18162,come on lets follow them they must know the way
18163,i think weve given them the slip the barbecues off whats the matter
18164,what
18165,let me look let me look
18166,shush keep still keep still i cant see anything they look perfectly normal to me
18167,yeah of course it is the flash probably numbed the optic nerve itll wear off in a few hours come on
18168,oh sarah
18169,gently gently
18170,shush if youre going to sit there wallowing in selfpity ill bite your nose
18171,come on lets go
18172,solons
18173,come on ive got the measure of solon now
18174,has he now
18175,well i have a feeling hes keeping something else there too something far worse than a headless body
18176,come on
18177,oh we got away
18178,yes i noticed i was very touched by your concern
18179,no thank you weve had one taste of your hospitality all i want from you solon is a professional opinion sarahs been blinded examine her eyes
18180,after you
18181,well
18182,now sarah dont worry whatever the truth is youll hear it go on
18183,thank you
18184,cant you operate
18185,nothing
18186,a chance
18187,what chance
18188,if thats whats needed ill get it
18189,i must take that risk sarah can stay here
18190,well see
18191,yes
18192,ding dong
18193,i need some of your elixir
18194,no not for myself sarah was blinded by the ray from your ring i need the elixir to restore her sight
18195,yes
18196,i see a wasted journey well thank you ladies thats really all i called about
18197,were not going through all that again if i wanted to steal from you would i come in through the front door
18198,i cant answer that question maren until i know what solon intends but i have a feeling something incredibly evil is brewing
18199,a time lord could live on karn without your knowledge he could place a barrier around his mind
18200,morbius was a time lord
18201,was solon living on karn at the time
18202,a war criminal a ruthless dictator but with millions of fanatical followers and admirers
18203,yes well thats something else i want to mention you really cant go on dragging innocent space travellers to their deaths
18204,until proved guilty those spaceships might just be passing no if im going to help you i must insist upon one thing
18205,wrecking of spaceships has got to stop agreed
18206,but id be no use to you dead maren and you do have a problem
18207,no flame no elixir no elixir pretty soon no sisterhood
18208,theres nothing mystical about that flame maren its a perfectly natural phenomenon if its dying there must be a reason a scientific physical reason
18209,then you have nothing to lose by letting me see it
18210,thank you
18211,is it always this colour
18212,fascinating and the heat from the flame causes oxidation of the chemicals in the rocks and then no doubt a chemical reaction with rising superheated gases and you have your elixir the impossible dream of a thousand alchemists dripping like tea from an urn
18213,oh i wouldnt think theyre beyond a decent spectrograph maren one could probably synthesise that stuff by the gallon though the consequences would be appalling
18214,what everyone trying to live forever no death is the price we pay for progress you know
18215,only in rare cases when for instance theres some difficulty in regenerating a body we dont take it regularly like you otherwise wed fall into the same trap
18216,immortality you must have been old when the elixir was discovered how many centuries have passed while you have remained unchanged how long since anything here changed
18217,exactly my point no progress please stand back
18218,a little demon
18219,soot thats all therell be no charge of course you wont get any elixir for quite a while yet this rocks got to warm right through
18220,hello sarah nice to be seen again
18221,you thought i was dead didnt you youre always making that mistake come on weve got to find morbius brain solon has to be stopped
18222,i cant be
18223,can you read his thoughts
18224,and crude it could lead to a brain malfunction and that spells danger
18225,are you all right
18226,gone for a lurch i think he killed condo shush you stay there
18227,ill be back soon
18228,he should never have been started
18229,really
18230,come on
18231,yes is that a stun gun
18232,he cant have gone far you go that way well try and cut him off across these rocks
18233,no damage
18234,solon this thing youve made is an unspeakable abomination its just throttled the life out of someone
18235,what
18236,all right solon but when we get him back hes not going out again not ever
18237,i mean this operation is going to end where it began on the operating table the brain can be detached and returned to the time lords
18238,five minutes solon youve got five minutes
18239,youve spent your whole life resurrecting evil now either you disconnect the brain or ill do it my way
18240,five minutes solon ill be back to count the pieces
18241,what
18242,knocked down a flight of stairs
18243,i was there
18244,solons dismantling him
18245,force majeure
18246,who morbius
18247,there was a civilisation here once now look at it and there are other planets like it all destroyed by morbius nothing but ashes
18248,its in the tardis
18249,theres a thousand tons of reinforced concrete between us and solons laboratory i know these places hydrogen plants are all built to the same basic design the scott bailey principle ive got an idea
18250,solon mustve kept the brain alive in a colloidal nutrient hydrogen cyanide sarah hydrogen cyanide
18251,hcn
18252,hcn
18253,prussic acid good girl
18254,i knew thered be one
18255,that isnt the idea that duct should lead to solons laboratory
18256,no im not
18257,weve got all we need to make cyanogen
18258,if we can create the right combustion conditions
18259,well if were still here in a month
18260,correct
18261,two million six hundred and seventy eight thousand four hundred
18262,with a methane filter what does it feel like to be the biggest mongrel in the universe
18263,free to cause more havoc more destruction
18264,you really cant go on calling yourself morbius theres very little of morbius left why dont you think of another name potpourri would be appropriate
18265,chop suey the galactic emperor
18266,brain getting a little overheated is it careful not as strong as it was
18267,i doubt it morbius all that time in a tank its gone soft do you dare put it to the test
18268,we have all the apparatus here i challenge you to a mindbending contest
18269,oh nothing nothing a mere nobody but i dont think youre in the first rank any more
18270,theres sporting gentleman
18271,time lord wrestling its usually a game but it can end in death lock
18272,neither do i are you ready
18273,nectar stewed apricots no custard ah
18274,was that the last
18275,and morbius
18276,come along
18277,goodbye sisters oh in case you have trouble with the chimney
18278,a might atom and a thunder flash
18279,dont you well
18280,have you considered an alternative explanation
18281,well that it might have originated in outer space
18282,mister dunbar how long is it since there was vegetation in antarctica
18283,shush it might still be ticking
18284,a timebomb mister dunbar a timebomb are you in contact with the expedition
18285,good tell them to keep a constant guard upon the pod and not to touch it till i arrive
18286,why not ive got my toothbrush remember no touch pod could be dangerous
18287,yes
18288,im only seven hundred and forty nine i used to be even younger
18289,how many of you live here
18290,where are the others
18291,i havent come ten thousand miles to discuss the weather mister moberley can i see the sick man
18292,whats his body temperature
18293,and the pulse rate
18294,i wonder
18295,then its accelerating how long before a medical team arrives
18296,i dont think thats going to be soon enough mister stevenson
18297,yes thats why i came here
18298,exactly before anything happened unfortunately it already has wheres the lab
18299,no
18300,its more serious than death mister stevenson hes changing form
18301,yes we need a blood test
18302,yes it would help thank you
18303,pod
18304,why did it open why
18305,mister stevenson what you have done could result in the total destruction of all life on this planet
18306,are you sure this is the place stevenson
18307,yes just as i thought
18308,no they travel in pairs like policeman
18309,no take it into custody and keep it in the freezer
18310,hmm
18311,hows winlett
18312,thats exactly what is happening moberley
18313,if you can just increase the magnification ah yes take a look at that
18314,do you recognise them
18315,exactly
18316,interesting isnt it a human being whose blood is turning into vegetable soup
18317,i dont know sarah hes halfway towards becoming a krynoid
18318,yes a progression of the pod
18319,yes i was fairly certain when i saw the photographs now im sure
18320,i suppose you could call it a galactic weed except its deadlier than any weed you know
18321,well on most planets the animals eat the vegetation hmm
18322,on planets where the krynoid gets established the vegetation eats the animals
18323,yes
18324,an obvious question i wish i knew the answer possibly their planet of origin is turbulent from time to time any internal explosions could cause surface matter to go shooting into space
18325,im thinking sarah im thinking
18326,is this the medical team
18327,id like to take another look at the patient
18328,now yes come on
18329,the process is almost complete
18330,there is something you can do but its drastic
18331,amputate the arm
18332,yes but the arms the source of the infection it might stop it spreading
18333,well of course i dont know but itd give you a breathing space while you try and find an antidote thats a chance worth taking isnt it
18334,oh you are moberley youre the only one who can
18335,you must help yourselves
18336,youre a good man moberley come on lets get started
18337,hot towels
18338,youll need more lights in there
18339,winletts still got a chance                scorby
18340,ready stevenson
18341,he left after killing moberley
18342,not charles the alien
18343,not of this world stevenson i told you he was changing form already his minds been taken over very soon his entire body will alter
18344,yes therell be a transition period a grotesque parody of the human form by now winlett himself no longer exists and we must destroy what hes become
18345,come on stevenson we dont have much time
18346,i hope thats the answer stay warm
18347,whats that down there
18348,lets take a look
18349,it left the place in a blizzard itll try to find shelter somewhere
18350,its as well to make sure
18351,dont you ever listen stevenson winlett winlett winlett winlett as a man no longer exists
18352,inimicable theyre lethal
18353,never mind how i know stevenson just take it from me on any planet where the krynoid gets established all animal life is extinguished
18354,winlett
18355,i hope youre right
18356,whatever you do dont touch him dont touch him
18357,have we annoyed you or something
18358,wolfgang amadeus mozart had perfect pitch
18359,who wolfgang amadeus oh him oh he died
18360,it happened because of a pod
18361,theres been an accident one of the men was infected
18362,yes you could say hes not quite himself
18363,oh much more dangerous than that and hes desperate for food and warmth theres only one place he can find food and warmth
18364,its a comforting thought isnt it i think we should lock all the doors and windows
18365,that grew in the bed that was part of the garden close to the house that jack
18366,well your candour does you credit however youre too late
18367,odd things have been happening odd and dangerous i dont thing youd understand
18368,all right at its simplest the man who went mad is no longer a man in any sense youd recognise
18369,an alien lifeform
18370,for some reason these two want to get their hands on the pod
18371,oh dont be a bigger fool than you already are dont you understand anything its dangerous
18372,its in the freezer
18373,dont worry youre all right with us we wont hurt you
18374,you dont like violence do you keeler not like your friend what are you a scientist botanist perhaps is that it were you sent here to identify the pod surely you understand the implications of what im saying
18375,i wish i could believe you
18376,where are you taking her
18377,scorby scorby scorby
18378,nothings hopeless all we have to do is think
18379,come on quick get over here and keep still i dont want to sever a blood vessel okay
18380,contact the main base on the radio
18381,see if they can intercept that aeroplane
18382,well just have to take a chance on that          stevenson
18383,whats the hurry
18384,ill have to try and warn him
18385,good morning
18386,greed greed the most dangerous impulse in the universe do you realise that on this planet the pod is unique i use the word with precision unique and to some people its uniqueness makes it valuable at any cost
18387,fanatics tell him you tell him you tell him
18388,be calm be calm listen both of you are you both listening to me i think they were dangerous but they were stooges i believe they were working for someone else
18389,whats more to the point is how they knew of the pods existence the discovery had been reported only to your department correct
18390,why not why shouldnt it be
18391,oh money
18392,yes money hired thieves and murderers dont usually work for love
18393,ill make a guess right here in this country action action thats what we need if we dont find that pod before it germinates itll be the end of everything everything you understand even your pension
18394,thank you
18395,good then organise us to the botanic institute now
18396,yes
18397,good lets go
18398,whats going on where are we
18399,who do you work for
18400,now just a minute
18401,you try the boot
18402,yes
18403,what
18404,amelia ducat
18405,is it why
18406,is that the common snakeshead fritillary
18407,no i mean did you paint it miss ducat
18408,were trying to trace the owner
18409,no we found it in a car boot
18410,a daimler car boot
18411,can you remember who bought this particular painting
18412,common snakeshead fritillary
18413,base
18414,its worth the risk to find that pod
18415,yes
18416,whats the best way in do you think
18417,not this time
18418,the back quick hide
18419,just act natural

18427,are we near the end i do so hate guided tours
18428,oh yes like scorby here

18433,come along sarah
18434,weve got to warn sir colin
18435,got a two p piece

18439,i win
18440,get in there and hide ill be as quick as i can
18441,why not ive got a pistol
18442,true but they dont know that do they

18444,youre working for a madman scorby you know that
18445,franklin adams 1881 to 1960 american humourist
18446,you know
18447,cant we talk this over scorby
18448,youre pushing your luck scorby
18449,looks as if its got possibilities
18450,quite right always put back in the soil what you take out
18451,thats very commendable
18452,not at all not at all
18453,oh no ive been watching your little toy its most efficient
18454,yes at the moment its working on an empty stomach
18455,oh yes
18456,im sure youre noted for your tidiness how is keeler
18457,nurtured you dont mean to say youve been feeding him
18458,what can i say
18459,i still cant think of anything to say
18460,quick sarah the button
18461,oh sarah
18462,it would have been such a waste
18463,yes but where              sarah
18464,quietly
18465,well all be compost if we dont keep away from that krynoid
18466,yes
18467,give it to me chase try and understand one thing the krynoid is an uncontrollable carnivore thats getting bigger and more powerful by the minute now  chase chase arrogant fool
18468,i dont know
18469,oh about the size of saint pauls cathedral after that itll multiply itself a thousandfold until it takes over your entire planet
18470,you dont scare us keeler you hear you dont scare us  do you think he believed us  krynoid
18471,it can think  krynoid
18472,yes it does seem to sense my knowledge of alien species particularly the krynoid  krynoid
18473,oh scorby take no notice of it ive heard that one before
18474,excuse me would you mind if i said something
18475,scorby if i die you die
18476,there is no chance by daybreak the krynoidll be large enough to crush this entire cottage to rubble if i could get outside thered be some hope for all of us
18477,it would make no difference we need a bomb scorby could you make a bomb could you make a fire bomb of some kind
18478,to distract the krynoid while we all slip away
18479,yes thats a good idea
18480,clear this door quietly
18481,out out out
18482,what have you decided major beresford
18483,waffle waffle waffle waffle wheres the brigadier
18484,and you cant act without authority
18485,revolutions going on down there
18486,somehow the krynoid can channel its power to other plants all the vegetation on this planet is about to turn hostile
18487,yes aggressive rhubarb
18488,no im not joking read this report i just snatched it from your secretary go on read it aloud
18489,you
18490,this bit
18491,shall we get started gentlemen
18492,things are moving at last sir colins seen the light and major beresfords getting a laser gun team together that should stop the krynoid im on my way back with a sergeant henderson
18493,come on sergeant
18494,break in
18495,come on
18496,come on lets get out of here
18497,come on weve got to get every plant out of this place and dump it outside
18498,theyre the eyes and ears of the krynoid
18499,good idea
18500,chase
18501,the other door come on
18502,weve got to find chase before he has another attack of megalomania krynoid on the outside a madman lurking inside not a happy situation
18503,shush shush shush i think weve been wrong about chase up till now
18504,will you just shut up a minute please you said chase went outside and actually took photographs of the krynoid and came in apparently unharmed unharmed
18505,or possessed
18506,you and henderson take that corridor sarah and i will go this way
18507,i doubt that
18508,wheres scorby
18509,come on lets join him there
18510,yes you go and do that
18511,oh scorby just think about what were up against everything that grows in the ground is your enemy you wouldnt get far
18512,hmm scorby bullets and bombs arent the answer to everything
18513,no more than you would scorby
18514,oh yes chase didnt do any irreparable damage i think i can fix this
18515,stop feeling sorry for yourself scorby itll become a habit
18516,probably the plants have got into the humidity system
18517,its possible
18518,ah henderson sergeant henderson
18519,you go and get him
18520,tell him i need beresfords wavelength
18521,hello beresford this is the doctor i can hear you over  beresford
18522,never mind us order that attack its your only chance out      raf
18523,quick sarah the button the button
18524,sarah i tried to save him he was trying to pull me in
18525,steam steam
18526,when i say come on come on
18527,sir colin the intergalactic floral society of which quite naturally im the president finds krynoids a difficult subject to study their researchers tend to disappear
18528,really when
18529,fifteenth fifteenth no impossible im fully booked for the next two centuries but any time after that
18530,have you ever heard of cassiopeia
18531,its a good place for a holiday we need a break come on
18532,sir colin do you fancy a little excursion
18533,its antarctica
18534,yes
18535,no
18536,yes
18537,yes just a minute
18538,have we been here before or
18539,the tardis where else
18540,ill give you a guided tour someday
18541,boot cupboard not very interesting
18542,oh ive seen bigger boot cupboards
18543,well how bigs big relative dimensions you see no constant
18544,how big are you at the moment
18545,listen listen there are no measurements in infinity you humans have got such limited little minds i dont know why i like you so much
18546,thats true thats very true
18547,yes yes it is good do you know this is the second control room you know i could run the tardis just as easily from here as i could from the old one come to think of it this was the old one
18548,its the mandragora helix i thought wed avoided it
18549,its a spiral of pure energy that radiates outwards in ways no one understands though at its centre theres a controlling intelligence
18550,yes
18551,yes it does seem more active than usual lets hope we can countermagnetise enough to resist the pull
18552,its living all right but thats all anyone
18553,well just have to push on and hope we come out the other side
18554,concentrate sarah
18555,anything anything say the alphabet backwards come on
18556,where
18557,i dont know the astrosextant rectifier has gone out of phase ill just go out and have a look not you me you stay there
18558,yes i thought i told you to stay inside
18559,what noise
18560,helix energy it could have been very nasty
18561,will you stop whittering
18562,strange forced landing
18563,not that time i didnt touch a thing promise
18564,maybe thats why i stopped using the old control room
18565,helix forcefields must have distorted the coordinates
18566,excuse me im a traveller around here im a stranger in these parts and i was wondering if youd seen a girl shed be about
18567,im a traveller
18568,have you seen a young girl about five foot
18569,probably with orange juice on her chin
18570,oh just a short gallop its good for the liver
18571,huh er doctor
18572,around around
18573,please dont threaten me count ive come here to help you
18574,a wave of energy has been released count its part of the mandragora helix it could do untold damage and i must take it back to the stars
18575,ask your seer hieronymous if hes ever seen an energy wave
18576,sometimes
18577,no
18578,because you dont have a future unless you listen to me
18579,this is all a great waste of time
18580,well it depends doesnt it
18581,on whether the moon is made of cheese on whether the cock crows three times before dawn and twelve hens lay addled eggs
18582,i can easily teach him all it requires is a colourful imagination and a glib tongue
18583,but you havent listened to a word ive said
18584,the mandragora helix has come home to roost
18585,stay there a minute
18586,yes i know particularly nasty roman sect supposed to have died out in the third century
18587,we are and the cult of demnos is still very much alive
18588,subthermal recombination of ionised plasma
18589,when we landed on earth we brought back with us part of the mandragora helix i dont know how it got in the tardis and now its here in this temple
18590,coincidence i wonder what the mandragora helix is up to
18591,no helix intelligences dont have a physical existence in the way you know it they dont need earth they want
18592,theres something behind us i can feel it in my bones
18593,apologies
18594,whos your uncle
18595,oh yes yes weve met
18596,tell me more about this federico
18597,are you sure of that
18598,i take it you dont get on with your uncle
18599,this is intensely interesting i dont think that sarah and i are going to be able to help you you see were just passing through how did you know my name
18600,oh i do dabble a bit
18601,youre too kind but that isnt the only reason you brought us here
18602,show us
18603,helix energy high ionisation that has only to touch human tissue to destroy it utterly
18604,no of course not nevertheless
18605,somethings certainly entered the city giuliano some malevolent power quite beyond the understanding of that old fraud hieronymous the question is why
18606,why here why now
18607,we seem to have an awful lot of questions its about time we started finding some answers
18608,giuliano it isnt easy to explain the concept of helix energy either sub or superthermal ionisation in your mediaeval vocabulary
18609,thank you
18610,well perhaps because the worshippers of demnos provided a readymade power base and what better place than fifteenth century italy
18611,because its the period between the dark ages of superstition and the dawn of a new reason
18612,yes oh yes giuliano that temple must be destroyed
18613,those ruins are the focal point for enormous forces the helix energy has penetrated every stone is there some way i could get there without being seen
18614,just tell me its better if i go alone
18615,just as far as the temple entrance no further
18616,from this point on i must go on alone you stay here
18617,you cant count count
18618,that was lucky the brethren ran right past wheres sarah
18619,what you mean shes wandering around in these catacombs lets have a look at this shoulder
18620,this should staunch the blood you know the finest swordsman i ever saw was a captain in cleopatras bodyguard he showed me a few points thats it i dont know that florence nightingale would approve this little lashup
18621,oh yes helix energy is still there all right played some very nasty tricks
18622,good lets go and see what happened to sarah
18623,what
18624,giuliano youre not afraid are you
18625,thats funny most people would be come on
18626,this way
18627,the ancients who built this place knew a thing or two come on        hieronymous
18628,sarah oh sarah
18629,i think so
18630,what happened
18631,i dont know perhaps theyre planning to come back for her you know this leads under the palace
18632,well the first time i saw the leader of the cult he was walking this way he probably comes this way regularly you know something i dont think the mandragora intelligence hijacked the tardis and brought us here by accident there must already be someone here whos sympathetic to its influence possibly theres been some tenuous influence for centuries
18633,what
18634,dont you worry about it ill explain it later come on
18635,anywhere we know
18636,oh excellent
18637,lets go
18638,theres nothing you can do on your own giuliano
18639,listen listen listen there are other considerations besides your uncle and his petty ambitions
18640,whos coming
18641,is leonardo da vinci coming
18642,if anything should happen to those men theyd be thrown back into a new dark age
18643,i have an idea who the leader of the brethren is
18644,dont worry about me im not likely to miss leonardo da vinci
18645,good evening
18646,its time you and i had a little talk hieronymous
18647,not sure of yourself influence comes and goes i suppose that must be very worrying
18648,oh you could say that yes
18649,fascinating predeluvian sandstone with a complex circuit of base metal fused into it
18650,hello sarah poisoned needle drop it
18651,oh you dont want to hurt me sarah im your friend remember your best friend drop it
18652,youre getting a bit old for this hieronymous
18653,drug induced hypnosis hieronymous is an old slyboots
18654,you only did what you were ordered what i expected
18655,well ive taken you to some strange places before and youve never asked how you understood the local language its a time lords gift i allow you to share but tonight when you asked me how you understood italian i realised your mind had been taken over
18656,see to marco
18657,count federico cant you understand im not interested in your political ambitions your enemies are not here in this dungeon theyre in the temple it isnt giuliano you have to fear its hieronymous
18658,that fake is the leader of the brethren
18659,yes and hes possessed of extraordinary powers helix energy
18660,you dont but if hieronymous isnt stopped i promise you therell be no dukedom for you or anyone else to rule over after tonight
18661,whatever you do count dont go near him
18662,no priest available will a brother do
18663,your count is dead
18664,yes in the temple ruins
18665,lets say hieronymous gave him a blank look
18666,rossini you dont have any authority to give orders any more giuliano is the lawful ruler
18667,wrong marco wrong the evils only just beginning hieronymous and the brethren remain
18668,shush marco marco giuliano if you go near that temple you go to your death
18669,the brothers are still absorbing power gather together all the men you can carpenters stonemasons soldiers and block every entrance to the palace turn it into a fortress because when the brethren attack youre going to need one
18670,anything to give us time i need time to think anyway his power isnt complete yet
18671,well so far
18672,yes tomorrow night when mandragora swallows the moon
18673,im just telling you what he told me
18674,hieronymous  when mandragora swallows the moon thats when theyll strike
18675,yes just about adequate pity another fifty years we could have used galileos
18676,astrolabe sarah
18677,astrolabe
18678,medieval sextant come on
18679,im trying to make this thing work exactly roughly wont do at all unfortunately the alidades almost a whole degree out compensate for error and convert to the copernican system
18680,ive got it
18681,forty three minutes and eight seconds past nine
18682,mandragora swallows the moon in other words a lunar eclipse
18683,yes more important its when all this could become mans only science
18684,nonsense it isnt nonsense miss just you remember what hieronymous did to you mandragora doesnt conquer in the physical sense it dominates and controls by helix energy astral force it takes away from man the only thing worth having
18685,well a sense of purpose what else the ability granted to every intelligent species to shape its own destiny once let mandragora gain control and mans ambition wouldnt stretch beyond the next meal itll turn you into sheep idle mindless useless sheep
18686,all or nothing ill have to risk it
18687,hello its nice to see you listen if its ionised plasma its molecular and by now must be spread pretty thinly among hieronymous and the brethren exhaust it exhaust it thats the answer
18688,could you get me one of these and a length of wire
18689,yes wire it must be at least a hundred and fifty years since wiredrawing machines were invented there must be some about the place
18690,good idea ill do that what was your question
18691,youre going to hold a dance
18692,dangerous my dear duke youve got lots of guests to entertain of course you must hold a hop sarah will love it ask her
18693,and giuliano save me a costume i love a kneesup
18694,good now the coat i dont want this to show thank you
18695,a little plan leave the wire
18696,that looks as if it would be very becoming eh
18697,remember the french at agincourt
18698,i think ill settle for the lion
18699,yes
18700,desperately bad but we can only do our best and hope you coming
18701,marco is leonardo among that lot
18702,i dont think im ever going to meet leonardo will you open up the dungeon entrance please
18703,thank you sarah i want you to stay here and keep an eye on this lot
18704,a time lord has to do what a time lord has to do besides youre not equipped
18705,did i oh yes
18706,well only if i guess wrong and then its fatal
18707,all right listen negatively charged high energy particles follow magnetic lines of force yes
18708,therefore if ive guessed correctly about the nature of helix energy i should be able to drain it off
18709,when did i ever guess wrong about anything
18710,hello there had a hard day in the catacombs have you
18711,oh come off it hieronymous you know who i am you can drop all that bosh about sacred stones and profanity just be your natural horrid self
18712,would you believe it i had no choice
18713,well you see thats a great pity because i cant allow you to interfere with earths progress
18714,its part of a time lords job to insist on justice for all species
18715,time lords dont die that easily hieronymous
18716,come on hieronymous you can do better than that come on heironymous
18717,come on
18718,well i thought that was rather clever  a case of energy squared it puts mandragora back to square one  well dont just stand there im in the market for congratulations  i wouldnt even say no to a salami sandwich
18719,this is lovely salami thank you
18720,im already committed sorry
18721,itll all come in time keep an open mind thats the secret
18722,come on sarah
18723,leonardo leonardo who
18724,oh that leonardo no i didnt get to see him good thing too
18725,well his submarine design wasnt exactly practical you know
18726,yes
18727,no he wont but the earth will their constellation will be in position to try again in about five hundred years
18728,thats right now that was an interesting century
18729,come on    ltback to the episode listing
18730,what i cant hear you for the siren
18731,all right theres no need to shout hold this
18732,is it nice in south croydon
18733,well maybe the season hasnt started yet
18734,do you have a season in south croydon
18735,were in a quarry
18736,well how do i know i dont know all the quarries that
18737,maybe he knows south croydon does he look as if he comes from south
18738,what
18739,my friends under that
18740,steady steady
18741,shes still breathing
18742,i said shes still breathing
18743,never mind about that get her off to the hospital and quick come on
18744,yeah ill talk to you later
18745,oh no no
18746,im well aware of that
18747,yes tell me hows miss smith sarah jane smith we came in together
18748,paralysis
18749,well sort of yes
18750,a place called gallifrey
18751,probably look could i see miss smith please
18752,antitetanus
18753,yes youre right solid as a rock
18754,did you see it
18755,hmm where is the path lab
18756,will you let me know when she comes round please
18757,what do you think of these plate doctor
18758,yes its beautiful
18759,does that crystalline lattice remind you of anything
18760,its silicon based
18761,so how many living forms do you know with a silicon based molecular infrastructure
18762,have we got access to an electron microscope doctor
18763,i dont know yet but its no hoax doctor carter
18764,i said we were investigating certain extraterrestrial possibilities
18765,such as viral infection on this planet
18766,yes i admit its a fairly remote possibility viruses can survive though not for a hundred and fifty million years as far as we know now this thing was found embedded in a stratum of blackstone dolomite
18767,jurassic limestone
18768,yes
18769,thats true would you prepare me another slide please
18770,i think the answer might lie in the quarry
18771,did you find anything else in the rubble
18772,any plastic
18773,yes plastic
18774,no spaceships can be made of plastic ceramic metal
18775,yes lifeforms dont all exist at the same time you know
18776,unless of course it just came fluttering down by itself but why and from where
18777,yes and where was it going
18778,carter you havent seen miss smith have you
18779,good where
18780,eh what do you mean
18781,what you mean she hit you
18782,yes of course
18783,what
18784,no no negative evidence no fragments which means whatever it was didnt crash but we can see from the fracture lines on this sample there was an explosion
18785,yes and probably millions of miles away intriguing isnt it
18786,perhaps it wanted miss smith
18787,well shes the only human being to have had any contact with it for any length of time probably the only living organism to have had any contact with it since the event
18788,inert yes dead maybe not
18789,what is it
18790,eh
18791,you mean it didnt look like that before
18792,you know what i think
18793,i think your samples been quietly absorbing radiation from the machine
18794,yes regenerating itself lets hope it hasnt absorbed enough to be dangerous put it somewhere safe carter away from any further radiation
18795,carter
18796,wheres the nearest nuclear reactor
18797,no no this way in
18798,but we werent were we come on lets find the control centre    man
18799,are you the top man here
18800,oh no i wouldnt say that shes certainly not
18801,oh not necessarily
18802,do you mind if i talk to her for a moment
18803,can you punch up the plan for this building on this machine
18804,ah
18805,oh at least at least
18806,her names smith miss smith
18807,could
18808,could i speak to her
18809,could i speak to her for a moment
18810,sarah listen to me can you hear me sarah
18811,sarah can you hear me
18812,sarah listen to me
18813,shush shush shush  sarah
18814,shush
18815,sarah who is eldrad what does he want    woman
18816,sarah keep her talking im going in there
18817,look the plans to your cooling duct
18818,not if im quick
18819,no theres no need youd roast
18820,what
18821,eldrad must live eldrad must live eldrad must live
18822,shush youre all right sarah youre all right shush shush shush
18823,well of sorts yes
18824,sarah
18825,whats the last thing you remember
18826,come on whats the last thing you remember
18827,do you remember me digging you out and taking you to the hospital the fossil
18828,do you remember doctor carter
18829,carter
18830,just a minute professor she doesnt remember a thing about
18831,its much more complicated than it seems
18832,i know i know
18833,shush i dont think we can blame her for it
18834,ill come to that in a minute just look at these readings stay there lie down sarah
18835,i know enough to kill a school of whales but there she is unscathed
18836,yes
18837,you wont believe me i warn you
18838,doctor carters dead unfortunately
18839,yes he tried to kill me he tried to push me over look ill start at the beginning
18840,we found a hand in the quarry or rather she found a hand in the quarry
18841,yes you said eldrad eldrad must live
18842,yes it seems to absorb radiation the same way as we do oxygen
18843,living its not only living its regenerating
18844,yes
18845,exactly then we can study it see what makes it tick
18846,shall i go with him
18847,i dont think radiations the danger
18848,yes theres no radiation it absorbs it to rebuild tissue see the fingers already been replaced
18849,what happened to the ring you used on carter and the guards sarah
18850,it must still be there driscoll driscoll
18851,there should have been a small crystal ring about so big in the reactor room
18852,oh
18853,would you mind she must have dropped it when i dragged her out
18854,sarah
18855,sit down
18856,now listen i want you to concentrate
18857,now sarah eldrad tell me about eldrad    driscoll
18858,who are we sarah
18859,who saw the light did carter see the light
18860,tell me more
18861,sarah theres no need to obey the will of eldrad put him out of your mind youre free of him
18862,yes
18863,what do you mean no joy
18864,it must have been up there and he must have found it
18865,because if affects the will of people whove been in contact with it remember carter he tried to kill me
18866,were going to have to shift it itll be gaining strength
18867,i hope youre right  guard
18868,driscoll
18869,yes im fine
18870,hes going to the core where else
18871,it doesnt make any difference that hand could set off a chain reaction
18872,quick get down    watson
18873,no
18874,yes
18875,nothing happened a sort of unexplosion has taken place
18876,yes
18877,oh no come on in watson come on in theres no radiation at all look
18878,look
18879,hes in the core
18880,it did but fortunately it was absorbed
18881,oh it could it could and it did
18882,yes fission took place but instead of the explosion going outwards it went inwards
18883,driscolls in the core probably vapourised you see its feeding on radiation and its now in control of the cores potential itself
18884,very much so and regenerating
18885,to live to grow you see instead of energy being created from matter matter is being created from energy eldrad is rebuilding himself and the probability is hell strike again
18886,who knows might as well put these back
18887,no but i like to be tidy
18888,somehow i cant see throwing missiles against that working
18889,no no no wait a minute sarah maybe we should try and communicate with eldrad
18890,take it out
18891,yes im sure they are
18892,yes but what do we know about it
18893,its intelligent
18894,an alien lifeforce shipwrecked on a strange planet crystalline regenerates through irradiation its probably afraid
18895,fascinating
18896,any second now
18897,yes
18898,theyve been neutralised in some way
18899,professor watson any being that can live let alone thrive inside a nuclear pile is hardly likely to be deterred by a few primitive missiles
18900,on your standards perhaps i think we should try much older weapons
18901,speech diplomacy
18902,conversation come on driver lets go    eldrad
18903,right you stay here ill go on shouldnt take long one way or the other
18904,not you you stay with professor watson
18905,you did
18906,thats true
18907,yes but
18908,i worry about you
18909,well both be careful
18910,hello you must be eldrad i was only going to say how do you do
18911,no tell me how did you prevent the missiles from exploding
18912,i thought so didnt i say i thought that was it i thought
18913,well im here to help them im called the doctor and this is sarah jane smith say hello to the lady
18914,eldrad    doctor
18915,oh because theyre stubborn and violent and sometimes they try to destroy things they dont understand      doctor
18916,what after all this time
18917,well youve been on earth a hundred and fifty million years and youve lain dormant all that time
18918,you didnt need to do that i would have told you
18919,shush
18920,only when such aggression is deemed to threaten the indigenous population i think thats how it goes
18921,that would contravene the first law of time a distortion of history i cant do that
18922,im not refusing eldrad ill take you back but it must be in the present time
18923,i dont think theres anyone else here
18924,do you accept our conditions eldrad
18925,good well follow me
18926,no eldrad leave him
18927,eldrad eldrad i swear to you if you dont release him ill never return you to kastria
18928,listen you owe your regeneration to this man remember that
18929,im not leaving here until i know hes all right
18930,very well
18931,come on lets go
18932,come in eldrad welcome to the tardis well what do you think
18933,well thank you im glad you like it
18934,theyre in here
18935,well in a sense you see we dont exist while were in here so you cant hurt us and we cant hurt you
18936,no
18937,well in a sense i think you could say im helping earth sarah after all i cant allow eldrad to go on smashing nuclear power stations who knows how big she might become or what damage she might do anyway i want to see kastria
18938,well travel broadens the mind
18939,what does that mean
18940,yes i wonder would you just give me a hand with the coordinates im a bit vague on the exact whereabouts of kastria
18941,oh just punch up seven four three eight oh oh o w eight i one two one two seven two seven two nine double one e eight e x four one one one three zero nine eleven five and then see what happens
18942,no i dont think so no could i just check your coordinates
18943,oh no no no i just want to make sure we get there
18944,eldrad youll achieve nothing on kastria unless you overcome this paranoid obsession with treachery you must cooperate
18945,oh dont be so abject all we want is your cooperation if youve missed those coordinates symbolic resonance will occur in the trackoid time crystal and if that happens therell be no chance of us landing anywhere ever ever ever
18946,you may have left it a bit late eldrad that hurricanes been blowing for a hundred and fifty million years
18947,near enough earth normal
18948,a bit high
18949,damn it the aliens have left this planet as good as dead
18950,but nothing functions theres no power i cant see how we can reach these survivors even if they do exist
18951,inexhaustible energy
18952,eldrad what was in this tube
18953,is there an antidote
18954,but there must be something
18955,worked it out from the indicator its all based on roots of three
18956,which way eldrad
18957,come on
18958,sarah
18959,come on sarah stop making a fuss sarah youre from south croydon
18960,youre a carbonbased lifeform the gas is only effective against silicon structures
18961,come on
18962,yes i know its that way
18963,i have a superb sense of direction
18964,i said i have a superb sense of direction
18965,im not sure
18966,could be millions of years
18967,are you all right
18968,we have
18969,well if youre made of stone you crumble to sand were walking on them
18970,its your imagination nothings been disturbed down here for thousands of years
18971,oh it was long ago come on
18972,what is it now
18973,presumably the aliens eldrad told us about the people who invaded the planet
18974,yes yes and theyre very rare and its something of a coincidence that there are two of them in the same galaxy
18975,its an abyss
18976,come on
18977,is there any other way eldrad
18978,its only got to last until we get across
18979,youve got no faith have you come on eldrad
18980,i never met a door that couldnt be opened somehow
18981,no
18982,get back
18983,get back get back
18984,i understand it now the crystal in the ring carries eldrads genetic code a master print that enables her to reconstitute herself from any suitable radioactive material
18985,the question is can i make this regenerator work
18986,i cant go any faster im guessing as it is well just have to use maximum irradiation and hope
18987,yes sarah weve been used they were determined to get eldrad one way or another
18988,we leave
18989,eldrad
18990,how do we know youre eldrad
18991,ah and so you modelled yourself on the first primitive you came in contact he modelled himself on you
18992,sarah thought youd been obliterated
18993,what about your enemies
18994,who is rokon
18995,you destroyed the barriers
18996,so all that business of alien invaders was a lie
18997,why should rokon want to destroy you in the first place
18998,ah but you do
18999,come on
19000,a recording from the past the king obviously knew there was a chance that eldrad would return  eldrad
19001,yes
19002,where are your subjects majesty
19003,shush
19004,well rokon seems to have solved the problem for us a drastic solution
19005,oh no thats not in the contract a oneway ticket only my obligation to you is over youre in your own world now
19006,no i dont think so
19007,oh well since youve put it so nicely
19008,here catch
19009,hold this
19010,when i say pull you pull
19011,pull
19012,yes
19013,my magicians stick
19014,come on
19015,no were well out of that goodbye kastria
19016,oh i doubt it very difficult to kill
19017,whoa easy old girl easy these temperatures must have affected the thermocouplings
19018,oh rubbish ive been to much colder places
19019,wheres that astrorectifier what did you say
19020,oh good good
19021,multiquantiscope
19022,mergin nut
19023,no no forget the mergin nut ill have the ganymede driver
19024,thank you
19025,zeus plug
19026,forget the zeus plug ill have the sonic screwdriver
19027,what was that you i dont know why she goes on like this theres really nothing the matter at all
19028,youre a good girl sarah
19029,what how did you know
19030,ive had the call from gallifrey
19031,so i cant take you with me youve got to go
19032,not this time i dont know whats going to happen
19033,no ive received the call and as a time lord i must obey
19034,yes
19035,weve landed sarah
19036,weve landed
19037,south croydon hillview road to be exact
19038,thanks
19039,oh sarah dont you forget me
19040,yes till we meet again sarah
19041,the panopticon
19042,right outside the capitol itself im in trouble now
19043,obsolete twaddle take no notice my dear old thing  spandrell
19044,i must get past them and warn the president
19045,hey just a minute excuse me
19046,now wheres the local news programme ah    runcible
19047,oh get off  goth
19048,what a way to travel but which way the panopticon
19049,here you are sir    time lord 1
19050,runcible my dear chap how nice to see you
19051,oh its all been forgotten about now old boy
19052,oh here and there you know round and about
19053,oh no just a twinge in the knee
19054,several so far
19055,yes and splendidly too if i may say so
19056,oh its a gift somehow you have a wonderful way of making the whole thing come alive
19057,what yes
19058,what
19059,no
19060,extraordinary the roofs still on i could have sworn it fell on me
19061,no no wait wait
19062,all right all right ill confess
19063,i confess youre a bigger idiot than i thought you were argh
19064,ive got nothing to say
19065,tweedledum
19066,tweedledee
19067,i see the hot and cold technique
19068,id like to help you how about a signed confession
19069,now thats a sensible question why should anyone want to assassinate a retiring president
19070,i never met him
19071,and you still think i did it
19072,what well thats monstrous vaporisation without representation is against the constitution
19073,you realise ive been framed dont you
19074,yes framed its an earth expression it means that someones gone to a great deal of trouble to get me into this mess
19075,to try and save the presidents life if you remember i left a note for you
19076,which presumably you did nothing about
19077,yes in a way i experienced it
19078,yes article seventeen
19079,i offer myself as a candidate for the presidency
19080,no sir i invoke article seventeen of the constitution which is a guarantee of liberty and says in part that no candidate for office shall in anyway be debarred or restrained from presenting his claim
19081,no sir i am claiming a legal right
19082,well its better than three
19083,suppose suppose i can convince you i didnt do it
19084,i just wanted to check it was the same staser you see that symbol at the end of the corridor
19085,you try and hit it  spandrell what
19086,the sights so you see i couldnt have shot the president if i tried and equally i couldnt hit the assassin thats why they were fixed
19087,yes yes he was in the party surrounding the president i saw him draw a staser and step forward i aimed a bolt at him but at that time i didnt know the sights had been fixed
19088,what is
19089,ill tell you where the evidence is
19090,in the public register camera i was standing right beside it
19091,about there
19092,yes
19093,is that it
19094,well at least hes alive
19095,matter condensation a particularly nasty sort of death
19096,i have im afraid
19097,yes its a technique the master picked up somewhere on his travels
19098,who is the master hes my sworn archenemy a fiend who glories in chaos and destruction
19099,yes a long time ago you know a lot of things are becoming clearer
19100,if the master is here on gallifrey then this represents the final challenge it explains why i was brought here there are old scores to settle and thats just a sort of greetings card
19101,it cannot be avoided like it or not gallifrey is involved and im afraid things will never be quite the same again shall we go down
19102,mmm perhaps perhaps
19103,fleabitings spandrell fleabitings things will get a lot worse
19104,well it might rouse some of them from their lethargy they live for centuries and have about as much sense of adventure as dormice
19105,i told you so if there had been a de on the master the first thing he would have done would be to destroy it
19106,rubbish anyone with a little criminal knowhow could do it i could do it myself
19107,childs play to the master do you think this stuff is sophisticated there are worlds out there where this kind of equipment would be considered prehistoric junk
19108,hes brilliant absolutely brilliant hes almost up to my standard whats that
19109,apc
19110,brain cells
19111,shush i understand the theory whats the function
19112,ah like the assassination of a president
19113,oh yes it was foreseen engin it was foreseen by me how very clever this time hes surpassed himself
19114,well dont you see what hes done we time lords are telepathic thats simply a brain storage system he intercepted its forecast that the president was to be assassinated and beamed it into my mind
19115,yes yes he could do it you said my de had been scanned
19116,yes hed need a biography print to beam a message accurately over that distance it makes sense spandrell
19117,i told you because he has an old score to settle
19118,by going in there and joining it
19119,well in a sense thats all a living mind is electrochemical impulses if i went in there i could discover where he intercepted the circuit
19120,im aware of that
19121,well its better than being vaporised and thats whats in store for me if i dont produce the master
19122,is this what happens to the neardeceased
19123,im ready when you are
19124,get on with it
19125,its an illusion dreams
19126,i deny it i deny it    figure
19127,no antitank gun
19128,so thats what he was up to
19129,must keep going i must keep going
19130,marsh gas
19131,what do you want of me
19132,ill make a bargain with you
19133,no you show yourself first your real self
19134,goth all right goth you win
19135,do you mind this is a nonsmoking compartment
19136,what
19137,tired
19138,you should see the other fellow where is he by the way
19139,goth
19140,yes the masters legman hes the assassin spandrell
19141,yes yes thats right
19142,is that all
19143,come on come on show me
19144,yes
19145,goth goth why did you do it
19146,but you would have been
19147,what was his plan goth
19148,goth goth what was his plan
19149,goth what was
19150,no answer to a straight question typical politician
19151,no what cardinal
19152,how kind
19153,somehow cardinal i dont want to stay
19154,weve bumped into each other from time to time
19155,like time lord history
19156,only in mathematics will we find truth
19157,borusa used to say that during my time at the academy and now hes setting out to prove it
19158,bad
19159,yes he was evil cunning and resourceful highly developed powers of esp and a formidable hypnotist and the more i think about it the less likely it seems
19160,well that the master would meekly accept the end of his regeneration cycle its not his style at all
19161,thank you not the master no he had some sort of plan thats why he came here engin
19162,he had a plan something to do with goth becoming the president whats so special about the president engin
19163,symbols
19164,tell me about rassilon
19165,could we hear that
19166,oh
19167,engin i can feel my hair curling and that means either its going to rain or else im on to something
19168,yes thats all very interesting could we hear the transgram
19169,must be a black hole
19170,shush  woman
19171,wheres it kept
19172,and the sash of rassilon wheres that
19173,of course what a stupendous egotist
19174,the master hed have destroyed gallifrey the time lords everything just for the sake of his own survival
19175,what
19176,tricophenyladehyde
19177,no its a neural inhibitor spandrell weve been fooled
19178,the master hes still alive
19179,the masters consumed with hatred its his one great weakness
19180,not in your case youd delay an execution to pull the wings off a fly
19181,dont do it engin
19182,dont give him the sash engin
19183,why have you brought me here
19184,the sash wheres the sash
19185,what
19186,engin that sash is a technological masterpiece it protects its wearer from being sucked into a parallel universe all he needs now is the great key and he can regenerate himself and release a force thatll obliterate this entire stellar system
19187,well of course i mean it dont you realise what rassilon did what the eye of harmony is remember that which balances all things it can only be the nucleus of a black hole
19188,a myth spandrell all the power of the time lords devolves from it neither flux nor wither nor change their state rassilon stabilised all the elements of a black hole and set them in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of the planet if the master interferes itll be the end not only of this world but of a hundred other worlds too
19189,youre right but weve got to get out of this place
19190,right
19191,oh come on come on give us a bunk up
19192,youre insane youre insane do you hear me youre releasing a force that nothing can stop
19193,if you undo that youll die as surely as any of us
19194,yes and the president was wearing it when he was shot down the sash wont protect you its damaged
19195,well youll just have to adjust the truth again cardinal what about subsidence owing to a plague of mice
19196,yes sir you said that many times sir may i go sir
19197,sir
19198,oh thank you sir
19199,but i like it out there thank you very much
19200,thank you spandrell
19201,well i didnt actually see him fall you know i was quite busy
19202,there was a good deal of power coming out of that monolith and the sash would have helped him to convert it
19203,no no i hope not spandrell and theres no one in all the galaxies id say that about the quintessence of evil goodbye spandrell
19204,oh goodbye engin goodbye
19205,i think this is not hyde park could be a nexial discontinuity must remember to overhaul those tracers put a knot in my hanky

19217,i keep on telling you im not the evil one who was it saved your life
19218,yes thank you never cross the boundary you know something im sure those creatures dont stay on their side of the boundary out of a sense of fair play there must be a fence of some kind
19219,yes a fence      xoanon
19220,got it low intensity sonic disrupter set in a hundred and eighty degree spread simple but effective
19221,yes it gives them a nasty headache if they go too close theyre probably set at intervals along the whole boundary
19222,xoanon whats those
19223,what hes a god
19224,really
19225,by whom
19226,well that sounds healthy anyway leela never be certain of anything its a sign of weakness now wheres this xoanon held

19229,what is it
19230,what
19231,i dont leela leela where are you
19232,what this is no time to be playing games
19233,you dont understand if theyre preparing for a battle theyre hardly likely to send men on patrol on the offchance that you might come back
19234,that was either very good shooting or very bad either way i wouldnt dream of moving
19235,im the doctor who are you and why are you shooting at me
19236,who

19240,i dont take orders from anyone
19241,good evening i think youre going to be very happy i came here tonight
19242,id be careful of that if i were you its an ultrabeam accelerator
19243,if there happens to be a charge in there you could transform this whole village into a smoky hole in the ground
19244,yes well look if youll just untie my hands i think i have an idea of whats going on i may be able to help
19245,oh no i can see youre a person of very superior intellect  are you the leader of this tribe or his he
19246,well gladly if i was holding him prisoner but im not
19247,eh
19248,dont hurry on my account
19249,andor listen to me
19250,andor please listen to me i am not the evil one i am a traveller thats all your tribe has obviously been visited by travellers before
19251,theyre space travellers andor men from another world the whole place is littered with their equipment their weapons and tools your legend of a captive god is obviously related to them in some way
19252,andor please think about what
19253,andor
19254,andor killing me isnt going to help you it isnt going to do me much good either is it
19255,how did you do that
19256,what
19257,no listen listen
19258,do you know this litany
19259,good then lets go and dont dawdle      all
19260,that wasnt necessary who licensed you to slaughter people no more janis thorns you understand ever
19261,what
19262,well now it seems i have been here before
19263,is it
19264,well of course i can remember im trying to perhaps i was on another part of the planet
19265,beyond the wall i wonder
19266,shush shush shush im wondering back to the village
19267,why not
19268,not if they dont catch us we wont anyway theyll be preparing for their battle
19269,well you cant expect perfection you know not even from me
19270,that was an armoured space glove or what was left of one
19271,amazing you know i had a feeling i had a feeling that neeva was actually expecting to hear an answer to his prayer
19272,i could quote you a few theologians whod give you an argument on that he was listening
19273,i thought i recognised it    xoanon
19274,poor old neeva hotline to god psst dont be afraid its only a machine for sending voices over long distances that may be xoanon speaking but its not god gods dont use transceivers
19275,arent you
19276,thats better  xoanon
19277,who did that voice remind you of
19278,more to the point who could that be i must take a look at the wall
19279,the principles really quite simple you just move everything forward a couple of seconds inside it you get a barrier thats impervious to all energy a true void ive seen it done as a parlour trick but never on this scale
19280,not unless whoever set it up deliberately bridged it
19281,are walking into a trap yes
19282,its too late anyway they wouldnt listen
19283,hello calib i was just thinking about you
19284,i wouldnt be surprised
19285,how was the battle
19286,leela put the knife away im sure hes a reasonable man
19287,leela seems to think it might be yours
19288,having first of all of course convinced you
19289,im impressed perhaps leelas right about you
19290,there isnt much time you see leela and i found an impenetrable barrier
19291,i thought you were too easily convinced
19292,she underestimated your ambition
19293,of course this too
19294,you need me alive remember
19295,come in who are you
19296,he poisoned her with a janis thorn up
19297,ill break your nose if you dont get up now pick her up both of you
19298,what at this range no all it needs is a flick of the wrist pick her up
19299,tomas you dont want her to die do you
19300,then cover him i need time to work
19301,shut up rattlesnake im trying to save time leela hasnt got much left
19302,got it
19303,watch the door
19304,are you all right
19305,yes there is just a matter of finding one
19306,yes well no no answers are easy its asking the right questions that is hard
19307,can you move
19308,tomas take her out of the back way
19309,youre going with tomas ill meet you both later go
19310,ha if you can believe that you can believe anything ill tell you once again i am not the evil one
19311,oh flapdoodle i was nowhere near it
19312,the attack failed because it was a trap from the start
19313,what do you mean throw them what is a horda anyway
19314,no politics hes trying to break neevas hold on the tribe
19315,good point fifteen love
19316,fifteen all
19317,game set and match to calib i think
19318,i take it there are more than ten in there
19319,ah
19320,and then what
19321,what the rope gets thinner the further it goes
19322,but it gets faster too the rope gets thinner the further it goes
19323,who is that man
19324,that man
19325,very good doctor very good well are you convinced now leela that was very nice of you to try and help me but really there was absolutely no need would you just release our friend please
19326,shoot like what oh like that in switzerland charming man william tell he was called well
19327,good      xoanon 2
19328,now we dont want to do anything hasty do we
19329,it means trouble large deadly and invisible
19330,good did you explain about their attraction to vibrations
19331,you know were very lucky they carried these things lets hope we can profit from the misfortunes of those travellers
19332,i mean the planetary survey teams thats where your tribe got its name from sevateem survey team the question is were you here before them
19333,you catch on quickly certainly they never returned to base
19334,why are you taking charge here
19335,tomas take this
19336,you just point it and press it its destructive up to about twenty times bow range short bursts tomas its selfregenerating but it takes time to recharge
19337,there that should keep xoanons creatures on their side of the perimeter now you and i have got to get inside that time barrier and soon
19338,i could build a time bridge myself but that would mean dismantling the tardis and then it mightnt work
19339,yes
19340,yes
19341,no
19342,yes
19343,well its quite simple we youre a genius a genius
19344,come on neeva neeva come on snap out of it man
19345,neeva
19346,have you heard it anywhere else
19347,where
19348,neeva neeva this is xoanon
19349,youve been a good and faithful servant neeva go back to sleep now
19350,too much too quickly
19351,shush xoanon
19352,they must have panicked
19353,yes come on we havent got much time
19354,the nose could be a shade more aquiline and the noble proportion of the brow hasnt been perfectly executed still we mustnt complain we live in an imperfect universe
19355,no it isnt up the nose its over the teeth and down the throat
19356,odd feeling
19357,standing in my own throat is
19358,theres only one way to find out
19359,i remember now the mordee expedition and i thought i was helping them
19360,tesh how did you know it was a tesh have you ever seen a tesh
19361,that was a protective suit and helmet must be another environment through there    doctor
19362,another shrine seems the tesh are as ignorant of their origins as your people are
19363,how does the litany go that bit about paradise leela you said you knew it you said you were taught it as children
19364,slowly slowly
19365,yes exactly that means the sevateem explored the planet while the tesh remained to work in the ship in the place where it landed here
19366,yes the sevateem were the survey teams and the tesh were the technicians youre all human beings from this colony ship
19367,im rather afraid i did i misunderstood what xoanon was
19368,at the time i didnt think he was a being at all these terminals are dead
19369,hello
19370,but where are they taking her
19371,have you dropped something
19372,yes well im very grateful about the honour but its really information i need please get up whats your name
19373,ah
19374,ah well it has a sort of logic outside the barrier physical courage and strength inside the barrier paraphysical achievement and the sort of psi power you used against leela its an experiment in eugenics
19375,shall we get up the floors very hard didnt anyone ever tell you kneeling stunts the growth jabel do you know where xoanon is
19376,where
19377,all right i didnt think you did
19378,do you know what a computer is
19379,do you know what a computer is
19380,now i have to find that thing before it kills us all      woman
19381,but there must be somewhere on the ship
19382,yes somewhere where no ones allowed to go
19383,yes where is it
19384,jabel thank you
19385,particle analysis
19386,it will kill her
19387,what thats not a good enough reason
19388,the savages dont open the barrier you lackbrain xoanon does do you understand that xoanon does
19389,give the order to stop that particle analyser
19390,will you give that order
19391,right then ill do it myself
19392,close your eyes
19393,to be strictly accurate it broke itself all i did was reflect some of the power back into it still i dont suppose its owners will see it that way come on wed better go
19394,looking for something
19395,oh probably probably
19396,a machine thats become a living creature an old mission computer with schizophrenia not a very pretty thought is it not my fault
19397,when i was here before i programmed xoanon for the mordee unfortunately i forgot to wipe my personality print from the data core or did i really forget i forget if i forgot
19398,it may have been my own egotism anyway now it has a split personality and half of it is mine is that clear
19399,well come on then      xoanon 3
19400,shut the door
19401,an auxiliary communications room
19402,looks like it theyre psitri projections from the dark side of xoanons id with enough kinetic energy to kill looks as if your friends are running out of time
19403,dont be absurd what do you think you can do about it if i can arrange it theyll be safer inside the barrier
19404,i didnt say safe i said safer
19405,i underestimated that man come on weve got an appointment on level thirty seven
19406,hold that
19407,keep watch
19408,xoanons unstable he might kill me hed certainly kill you anyway we need someone on guard
19409,im the doctor im the doctor    xoanon 3
19410,to correct a mistake i made when i was here before
19411,i made the mistake
19412,i made the mistake when the ship was stranded the computer broke down i thought the data core had been damaged so i renewed it by making a direct link with the compatible centres of my own brain
19413,a variation of it yes
19414,this isnt a fairy tale it actually happened
19415,no no without realising it they had created life the computer hadnt failed at all it had evolved into a living creature the first of an entirely new species  xoanon 2
19416,when it woke it had a complete personality mine it thought i was itself then it began to develop another separate self its own self and thats when it started to go mad  xoanon 2
19417,its here xoanon im talking to it its you
19418,and i am the doctor
19419,im the doctor  xoanon 3
19420,leela are you all right
19421,yes part of him its just a question really everything beyond that door is xoanon you were inside him the most powerful computer ever built
19422,hes insane
19423,his first impulse will be to kill me itll be more important to him than anything else
19424,yes because i contradict what he thinks is real im a threat to his world red lighting and the smell a sort of smell of a smell
19425,yes a precaution in case i got out as traps go a bit haphazard why not electrify the floor i would have expected something more positive
19426,yes xoanons just warming up come on when he gets desperate enough hell destroy everything to get at us
19427,ah these could be useful you know the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common
19428,something the matter
19429,oh youre just probably tired thats all can you still remember the way to the main control room
19430,come on then you lead on
19431,ha youll have to be quicker than that you overblown adding machine
19432,sensory links everywhere thats impossible     doctor
19433,so we know exactly where he is fair does you wouldnt want an unfair advantage would you
19434,i thought youd say that
19435,ah
19436,now we can see too
19437,they watch and control various parts of the ship make sure everythings working properly
19438,atomic generators
19439,well ill explain it all
19440,well it means ive got about twenty four and a half minutes to build a reverse memory transfer system and wipe my personality print from its brain
19441,if i cant do it the atomic generators will explode taking xoanon us and half the planet with them effective but crude
19442,youll be all right
19443,now xoanon
19444,hello
19445,ow i wish i hadnt
19446,yes how long have i been out
19447,two days two days i havent got time to be lying around here for two days
19448,dont you listen
19449,no i dont suppose you do i removed i hope i removed half of xoanons dual personality how is he
19450,what
19451,and what do you call it
19452,thats better
19453,give me a chocolate i think ill go and see xoanon
19454,perhaps perhaps
19455,well if he was psychotic hed be impossible to control perhaps xoanon will tell us anyone at home
19456,how do you feel
19457,oh im fine now thanks cant complain
19458,but you told yourself you were breeding a race of superhumans
19459,hostility and conflict to speed up the process until you were ready to select the best of both
19460,yes it is horrible isnt it horrible
19461,oh well it was the least i could do in the circumstances after all i did start the trouble in the first place
19462,i dont think anyone could have made it
19463,well now isnt this nice
19464,gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen democracy at work i see
19465,he said hes extremely sorry about all the trouble that hes caused that he has great power and knowledge and he puts it all at your disposal
19466,he offers you this as a token of his good faith
19467,well theres one way to find out
19468,ah but thats not my problem
19469,leela what are you doing here
19470,you dont need that leela the phantoms were merely projections of xoanons disturbed subconscious hes better now
19471,invariably invariably goodbye
19472,why
19473,well yes i suppose i do like you but then i like lots of people but i cant go carting them around the universe with me goodbye
19474,hmm
19475,if you want to
19476,affect this no its a yoyo its a game i thought you were enjoying it
19477,magic leela magic
19478,exactly to the rational mind nothing is inexplicable only unexplained
19479,hmm all right ill show you its because insides and outsides are not in the same dimension
19480,now which one is larger
19481,but it looks smaller
19482,exactly if you could keep that exactly that distance away and have it here the large one would fit inside the small one
19483,thats transdimensional engineering a key time lord discovery
19484,seeing whats outside
19485,one box inside another i just explained it to you
19486,well its a rather dull subject anyway i wonder where we are
19487,well not precisely no
19488,well of course i can control it nine times out of ten well seven times out of ten five times look never mind lets see where you are
19489,i never carry weapons if people see you mean them no harm they never hurt you nine times out of ten
19490,its basically hardened alloy scored all over it must come in under great pressure
19491,whatever it is they fill it up with
19492,this is very interesting
19493,it comes in here
19494,whatever it is
19495,desert either that or the tides gone out
19496,theres no water so nothing grows nothing at all by the look of it
19497,hmm a bit garish for my taste
19498,hmm looks like dust its a sandstorm come on lets get out of here come on this is a sandminer were in one of the scoops
19499,the storm could be travelling at a thousand miles an hour the sand will cut us to pieces unless we get back to the tardis come on
19500,the shutters
19501,if there are no manual controls were dead
19502,there must be a way out
19503,well we cant get out of it until we find the tardis
19504,because robots are programmed to help people not hurt them you wont hurt us will you  v9
19505,mineral extraction the surface of this planet is a sea of sand    doctor
19506,thank you
19507,robots dont have feelings its the people they serve we must hope are friendly
19508,what robots dont need chairs and certainly not padded ones
19509,well im the doctor and thats leela i wonder if its possible for us to speak to the person in charge id like to thank him for saving our lives  sv7
19510,trying to get out  sv7
19511,first we find the tardis then we have a little scout round and well be back before they know
19512,hello my dear old thing
19513,thank you thank you very much  sv7
19514,a simple no thank you would have been sufficient
19515,im fine
19516,shush its because theyre frightened thats why theyre dangerous
19517,im the doctor i assume youre in command here
19518,just standing here talking to you
19519,no doubt you would
19520,well were travellers we came here by accident
19521,well its a small world
19522,oh sorry i thought it was a rhetorical question yes its just a coincidence
19523,no thats an inference i wasnt hiding that body i was finding it and id say it was put there for precisely that reason someone wanted to kill me too
19524,to put suspicion onto me
19525,a dead stowaway
19526,well yes now you come to mention it i do remember once
19527,er ahem there is one other possibility you seem to have overlooked
19528,you know youre a classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain
19529,thank you
19530,yes i just want to scratch
19531,of course not
19532,yes then locked the molecular structure the results bands as solid as cast iron
19533,i wouldnt say that
19534,concentrating whatevers locked can always be unlocked its just a matter of thinking out the right combination
19535,no more than two or three weeks
19536,well there are several million combinations to think through
19537,im taking it very very seriously i have an uncomfortable feeling that if the murderer doesnt kill us the commander will that is assuming theyre not one and the same person
19538,you could undo these clamps
19539,are you a hunter poul
19540,that concerns you
19541,well
19542,i know i know i know its the first programme thats laid into any robots brain from the simplest dumb to the most complex super voc but suppose suppose someones found a way of bypassing it
19543,bumblebees
19544,terran insects aerodynamically impossible for them to fly but they do it im rather fond of bumblebees come on theres something i want to look at
19545,tell us about it what was his name
19546,who found him
19547,so whoever killed him was strong too strong for him to resist
19548,what do you think he was doing here
19549,where was he found
19550,is that one of his packages
19551,good imagine youre chub theres a storm coming up pass me one of those packages
19552,come on come on in those circumstances youre in a hurry what would you do
19553,what do you mean i cant imagine what itll mean this isnt the only robot dependent civilisation in the galaxy you know
19554,sit down sit down what did you call those robots
19555,yes you know people never really lose that feeling of unease with robots the more of them there are the greater the unease and of course the greater the dependence its a vicious circle people can neither live with them nor exist without them
19556,oh i should think its the end of this civilisation
19557,thats true
19558,youre letting your imagination run away with you
19559,no i cant by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes no i cant and neither can you
19560,come on    toos
19561,what happened
19562,never mind about that whats happening
19563,youll have to cut the power
19564,if you dont shell blow herself to pieces
19565,i know what youre thinking but we had nothing to do with it
19566,its a gift may i remind you well all go together when she blows if you dont cut the power
19567,whats the limit before the motive units explode
19568,severance kit severance kit quickly
19569,fighting sabotage with sabotage
19570,what    v16
19571,theres nothing for it youve got to cut the zeta links
19572,i like a man who stays calm dask but this isnt the titanic

19580,i think ill go and talk to your dumb friend
19581,yes  sv7
19582,professional interest or morbid curiosity which there are three types of robots aboard this mine dumbs vocs a super voc and then theres you would you care to explain that i see well then perhaps id better tell sv7 you can talk  d84
19583,youre a robot detective what does your computer mind make of this  d84
19584,ah  d84
19585,yes this is the place  d84
19586,well of course they can if theyre modified to it and some of them have been where are you    doctor
19587,get to the command deck take leela dask poul everyone and get them to the command deck get the robots out of there and secure the doors is that clear    doctor
19588,what is it toos  toos
19589,why does it upset you
19590,thats far enough what are you doing here
19591,ah id come over here if i were you slowly
19592,now either it followed you or else it homed in on this it depends which of us is going to be killed first that is you or me  v4
19593,finish it off before its too late
19594,the probe stopped can you do it
19595,take care    v4
19596,dont just stand there seven give me a hand  sv7
19597,no i meant fast as in nimble never mind well soon find out    v4
19598,it hasnt gone bad its command circuits been changed
19599,taren capel could
19600,yes the mad scientist very mad scientist      d84
19601,of course there had to be one i should have thought of that before
19602,safe safe
19603,uvanov you remind me very strongly of a lady called marie antoinette theres a robot revolution going on out there and you say weve got no problems
19604,uvanov look over there
19605,shut the door toos i may not have time to explain theres a new generation of killer robots about uvanov the killers are controlled by taren capel and d84 is controlled by poul these two are undercover agents for the company  d84
19606,well his body language was all wrong
19607,well its a theory that a person expresses himself in the way he moves
19608,yes you did do you know whats wrong with poul uvanov
19609,thats right the loid call it grimwade syndrome
19610,oh yes yes it is until one gets its hands around your neck i dont suppose there are any weapons aboard this mine
19611,they are now  sv7
19612,five minutes and the antiblast doors will hold another ten antiblast do you carry blasting powder aboard this mine
19613,what in here
19614,they might work uvanov if you could pass a positive charge through the metal plate youd be able to magnetise them and have antirobot bombs
19615,well thats your problem i cant be everywhere at once toos open this door for me
19616,the robot mortuary toos lock this door after us and dont let anyone in is that clear
19617,d84 and leela remember toos if we dont come back youll have to find some other way of warning the outside world
19618,ten robots
19619,strange i would have expected taren capel to be in at the kill come on weve got to hurry    dask
19620,d84 do you know the storage bay where chub kept his equipment  d84
19621,yes borgs at a guess he was strong enough to put up a struggle
19622,yes thats what probably triggered his collapse
19623,its an unreasoning dread of robots you see most living creatures use nonverbal signals body movement eye contact facial expression that sort of thing
19624,exactly while these robots are humanoid presumably for aesthetic reasons they give no signals its rather like being surrounded by walking talking dead men
19625,yes it undermines a certain type of personality causes identity crisis paranoia sometimes even personality disintegration
19626,im going to try and patch this communicator into dasks private command circuit
19627,yes taren capel if i can discover where he modified this do you have to talk so much
19628,yes planning to modify them and reactivate them later today the mind tomorrow the world right now he must be a happy little maniac    d84
19629,come on hold this d84 and dont press anything    d84
19630,come on try it for size
19631,now this is a cylinder of gas when dask comes in i want you to turn the valve so

19638,dask dask you look ridiculous in that outfit not half the robot your father was
19639,losing your calm dask hmm thats not the robot way it was your verbal and physical precision that made me spot you robot upbringing
19640,robots would have no existence without humans dont you see that dask
19641,youll be all right toos  sv7

19780,i dont know whos a blackguard some slavering gangrenous vampire comes out of a sewer and stalks this city at night hes a blackguard ive got to find his lair and i havent got an hour to loose look you see ive been trying to trace the line of the sewers thats the thames this is the line of the fleet and that is the palace theatre
19781,good good
19782,right
19783,i caught a salmon there once would have hung over the sides of this table shared it with the venerable bede he adored fish
19784,were about to embark on a very dangerous mission
19785,made in birmingham yes thats the main requirement could you get me a small boat
19786,yes to find the confluence of the thames and fleet professor then to follow the fleet
19787,oh and then we shall see
19788,there it is fifty yards ahead
19789,ive always enjoyed messing about in boats
19790,my dear litefoot ive got a lantern and a pair of waders and possibly the most fearsome piece of hand artillery in all england what could possibly go wrong
19791,explode unthinkable it was made in birmingham tie up over there skipper
19792,all right professor  litefoot
19793,you were lucky
19794,which enemy
19795,this gun takes about half an hour to load lets go this way
19796,say that again
19797,like old leaves sounds like an organic distillation drained out the life essence
19798,did he
19799,well he doesnt hes a madman
19800,what
19801,ah
19802,they do
19803,yes im trying to place the period it can only be opened by a key of the correct molecular combination
19804,yes
19805,yes hes probably got the key
19806,well presumably hes calling himself wengchiang
19807,i know that professor i know and he probably arrived in this contraption
19808,then youre very lucky professor that he hasnt traced it before now
19809,weng
19810,yes its charming isnt it charming professor
19811,ill be proud to take to take you to the theatre looking like that
19812,i have an appointment at the palace theatre tonight and if youre very good ill buy you an orange

19818,thank you are you quite comfortable down there
19819,oh quite a few quite a few
19820,im expecting further developments very soon mister jago
19821,i knew i could rely on you
19822,no
19823,nobody when the moment comes mister jago you and i can face our destiny shoulder to shoulder
19824,theres no obligation
19825,perhaps itll come looking for us
19826,oh very good very good wasnt that good anything else
19827,hes dead he died of a fright
19828,no chang was as surprised as anyone wheres he gone
19829,youve been left to carry the can chang
19830,well as an accomplice to murder the police shouldnt hold you up long tell me about wengchiang where did he go
19831,li hsen you know hes not a god dont you
19832,go on
19833,the cabinet what happened to the cabinet
19834,not this time leela
19835,theres no escape that way hes gone to join his ancestors
19836,yes up to his epicanthic eyebrows
19837,youll have to book yourself a new act tomorrow cyanide gas might do for the brutes though youd have to shut the sewers off for a day or two
19838,not chang his master the crazed maniac who organised all this
19839,that means hes going to start up all over again somewhere else
19840,with his dna helixes split open the more cells he absorbs into himself the more deformed he becomes
19841,yes
19842,perhaps because he used the cabinet a dangerous experiment in time travel now hell be struggling to keep his metabolism in balance
19843,just an experiment he had to gauge the strength of the psionic amplification field the rats were handy after that they were useful as sewer guards
19844,i must things to do  weve got to get back to that time cabinet come on  a screech from a giant rat in the sewer drives jago up the ladder
19845,litefoots got visitors
19846,what
19847,well they got what they came for
19848,the time cabinet
19849,get him a drink
19850,were they all chinese
19851,and one midget
19852,elementary my dear litefoot he came in the laundry basket and let the others in
19853,the peking homunculus
19854,yes the time of manufacture its disappearance it all fits
19855,homunculus
19856,it was made in peking for the commissioner of the icelandic alliance it was in the ice age about the year five thousand
19857,the peking homunculus was a toy a plaything for the commissioners children it contained a series of magnetic fields operating on a printed circuit and a small computer it had one organic component the cerebral cortex of a pig anyway something went wrong it almost caused world war six
19858,yes somehow the pig part took over so wengchiang has brought the peking homunculus back through time he could have done it disappeared completely it was never found
19859,unsuccessful time travel professor findickers discovery of the double nexus particle sent human science up a technological culdesac
19860,this pig thing is still alive it needs an operator of course but the mental feedback is so intense that somehow the swinish instinct has become dominant it hates humanity and it revels in carnage
19861,rundall buildings
19862,your laundry do you know the place
19863,and where exactly is this disreputable quarter
19864,yes it might be cleared very quickly
19865,wengchiang is a scientific ignoramus he doesnt understand the nature of zigma energy
19866,yes the power source of the time cabinet is a zigma beam at the moment its like a piece of elastic fully stretched but when chiang tampers with it
19867,well theres only one way to find out litefoot i want you to stay here come on
19868,nothing as vile as wengchiang himself professor
19869,not a sound now quiet shush
19870,papaver somniferum
19871,pipe of poppy its opium a narcotic drug
19872,yes hell try to build his body levels before he has to use the zigma beam hell kill again tonight but where
19873,good evening mister chang we thought youd gone to join your ancestors
19874,yes rats dont keep a very hygienic larder
19875,it was a good act chang
19876,tell me about the house of the dragon
19877,the house of the dragon where is it
19878,li hsen come on come on
19879,li hsen come on man the house
19880,boot shoe spat
19881,hes left us a chinese puzzle
19882,my dear doctor contained in this capacious carpet bag which i discovered inadvertently in the cellar is a collection of sundry items of baffling meaning the professor and i are keeping observation on the theatre and shortly hope to report to you the whereabouts of the mysterious wengchiang your fellow detective h g j
19883,ah eureka do you know what that is
19884,thats right its a trionic lattice an integral part of a time cabinet its impossible to open it without it
19885,yes hes not only a scientific fool hes an absentminded one
19886,no eurekas greek for this bath is too hot there can never be another one of this combination
19887,hold it
19888,i do
19889,look litefoot likes a good fire hes been out of the house a long time we cant go just rushing all over london looking for him its much better to wait for wengchiang to come here
19890,yes but he doesnt have the key always stay one step ahead of your enemies my girl
19891,youre learning to think thats excellent
19892,well almost
19893,what for
19894,thats all right
19895,what
19896,what sort of crossfire hazelnuts bread pellets
19897,i brought you to the wrong time my girl youd have loved agincourt
19898,lifes full of little surprises what have you done to her
19899,take my advice dont
19900,now i wonder what that could be im always borrowing things from people and then forgetting where ive put them
19901,what one of these
19902,oh the time key now heavens to betsy where did i last see that
19903,is this what you want the trionic lattice
19904,careful careful i might have dropped it
19905,crystalline probably break into a thousand pieces
19906,when im crowded i get nervous call your dogs off
19907,thats better
19908,never trust a man with dirty fingernails
19909,i tell you what ill make a bargain with you you can have the trionic lattice when we get to the house of the dragon
19910,no trickery youre holding two others of my friends
19911,i want them released
19912,i doubt if you could understand that but thats the condition
19913,good right then you and your chaps can lead the way and ill follow
19914,no the girl stays
19915,just lead on
19916,very impressive ill have the birds nest soup
19917,well isnt this where you do the cooking
19918,simple oldfashioned cannibalism that machine just saves you having to chew the grisly bits
19919,bunkum your socalled technology is the twisted lunacy of a scientific dark age
19920,everything where is it
19921,your pigfaced pigbrained peking homunculus      weng
19922,listen whats your name what were you called before you became a chinese god
19923,oh yes the infamous minister of justice the butcher of brisbane
19924,i know youre a wanted criminal and that a hundred thousand deaths can be laid at your door
19925,they were slaughtered in your filthy machine
19926,your work
19927,the zigma experiments came to nothing they were a failure nothing came of them
19928,hmm look what it did to you
19929,good morning gentlemen
19930,no jago jago jago we dont have the place surrounded we just have an understanding

19944,well greel wont keep us waiting long he needs his proteinoids
19945,hes dying you see hes desperate his bodys fading away fast hes trying to cheat death by substituting certain materials do you understand
19946,the principles false anyhow all he achieves is a postponement of the inevitable
19947,lucifers professor quick get over there now listen if we do manage to get out of here dont stop running till youre a mile from this place

19957,its a laser beam
19958,push it over
19959,its no good greel youre finished
19960,greel listen if you activate the zigma beam itll be certain death for all of us
19961,listen greel greel listen the zigma beam is at full stretch if you trigger it again itll mean certain collapse you know what that means
19962,therell be a huge implosion greel and youll be at the centre of it the zigma experiments were a disaster
19963,cellular collapse
19964,well lets hope you never see anything like it again professor
19965,he was a foe from the future henry look out leela
19966,its his fuse henry

19973,its not even hove it could be worthing
19974,oh not really not failed were on the right planet in the right time roughly in the right general direction assuming this is worthing
19975,because the localised condition of planetary atmospheric condensation caused a malfunction in the visual orientation circuits or to put it another way we got lost in the fog never mind easy enough to pop back in and try again thats odd
19976,a lighthouse without a light
19977,oh good well just knock on the door get directions and well be on our way
19978,foghorn
19979,i said its a foghorn it warns the ships off these rocks mightnt spot the light in this fog you know what ships are we saw some on the thames remember
19980,keeper
19981,it could be shorting out i suppose
19982,what without asking permission i wouldnt dream of it lets talk to the crew first this way teshnician
19983,no it isnt
19984,im the doctor how do you do you seem to be having some trouble here
19985,were mislaid mariners our crafts parked on the other side of the island
19986,yes
19987,good
19988,worthing
19989,yes
19990,well small in some ways
19991,whats the trouble here
19992,tricky things the early generators
19993,ben whos ben
19994,just the two of you are there
19995,yes i know the type in the early days of oil hed have said theres nothing like a really large candle eh
19996,wheres ben now
19997,ben why isnt he working on the generator
19998,no no i didnt
19999,no thats all right thats all right whats your name
20000,ill go mister hawkins im something of an engineer myself i might be able to help you look after the young lady
20001,ben ben no ben
20002,im over here
20003,yes i always find trouble
20004,i doubt it
20005,hes over there dead hes been dead some little time
20006,as far as i can tell a massive electric shock he died instantly
20007,vince youd better go and tell old reuben whats happened go on
20008,i thought there might have been something nasty in the coal hole theres something nasty somewhere
20009,what that can open and shut doors and doesnt so much as leave a wet footprint and has the ability to drain off electricity
20010,thats bens lantern
20011,this is very interesting leela its called a marconi wireless telegraph you can send messages a long way with this
20012,sorry shouldnt you be using it to report bens death
20013,no
20014,you do know how to operate it
20015,was the expert
20016,oh very likely
20017,reuben do you think we had something to do with your friends death
20018,incontrovertible
20019,what are you going to do clap us in irons
20020,reuben were only trying to help
20021,stubborn old mule
20022,i dont know
20023,i dont fancy playing tag in the fog with something that can do that i think ill go and have a word with vince
20024,what time was that
20025,how far away
20026,yes yes i noticed the cold youre a good lad vince
20027,of course on pharos they had slaves to keep the bonfires going
20028,oh yes and ill tell you something else now on gallifrey
20029,yes galli
20030,oh no not a bit of it dont mind me
20031,reuben theres a light out there
20032,theres a light out there
20033,and going fast
20034,keep that siren going        reuben
20035,no i dont suppose it would it seems to need electricity        palmerdale
20036,luminous do you think you could show me the spot
20037,when i find out ill let you know
20038,the beast of fang rock
20039,wheres harker your coxswain
20040,ill wait
20041,good
20042,and whose seamanship was it got you on the rocks
20043,no but im full of ideas
20044,yes of course vince off you go leela
20045,youd better go with him
20046,yes
20047,one of the keepers was electrocuted earlier this evening and since then vince doesnt like going down there
20048,just a moment we havent been introduced
20049,where were you heading
20050,when your yacht struck
20051,what about the rest of the crew were any other boats launched
20052,ah you want to get to london
20053,youve no chance in this fog
20054,its all right leela hes a friend arent you harker
20055,its all thats left of ben where did you find him harker
20056,it wasnt the sea that did that
20057,theres some hot soup in the crew room harker
20058,the others are already there
20059,what beast
20060,theres no such animal
20061,leela the people round here have been fisher folk for generations theyre almost as primitive and as superstitionridden as your lot are
20062,postmortem
20063,something wants to make a detailed study of human anatomy  vince
20064,yes im here vince
20065,obviously i was wrong the shock simply stunned him he partly recovered staggered out onto the rocks fell into the sea and was drowned you get on about your work vince theres nothing supernatural going on round here
20066,electricity has strange effects vince
20067,hmm
20068,thats all right vince
20069,because i dont know what the truth is yet
20070,the inquirys already begun move over
20071,just you stay here all of you harker you try and get some rest
20072,what a strong electrical field strong enough to kill a man on contact interesting probably explains the phosphorescent glow and fish at a distance of several yards
20073,i dont know what it is leela i think its desperate and i think its cunning and i think its time we were getting back
20074,i do i think he was taking bens body away for examination when you saw it
20075,under the sea earlier tonight vince saw what he called a fireball fall into the sea not far away
20076,not another tardis a spaceship perhaps yes an alien creature which has never before encountered human beings might just behave that way
20077,theres electricity perhaps thats what attracted it
20078,yes
20079,yes
20080,yes just a minute its behaviour pattern is furtive
20081,that means it keeps out of sight while it spies out the land hoping to mount a successful attack
20082,no but cunning i dont think this fogs a freak of the weather
20083,i think its been contrived to isolate us that creature or whatever it is will be getting bolder by now its seen this primitive technology its had time to calculate the physical strength of its enemies i think were in terrible trouble
20084,what about the others theyll think were mad if we start talking about creatures from outer space
20085,shush dont tell them that whatever you do what do you mean do not be afraid
20086,let go harker
20087,come on sit down sit down all that can wait gentlemen ive got news for you this lighthouse is under attack and by morning we might all be dead anyone interested
20088,understand this no one but no one is to leave this lighthouse for any reason is that clear
20089,you heard what she said
20090,are you sure
20091,i believe youre right
20092,leelas senses are particularly acute and if she says its getting colder its getting colder
20093,reuben
20094,dont talk to any strangers
20095,well theres nothing out there now were you calling
20096,get that door shut do you know what i think
20097,probably probably
20098,this electrical
20099,got it u by q over r
20100,shush
20101,thinking
20102,reuben i thought you said youd seen him
20103,then why didnt you tell me
20104,why am i standing here wasting my time trying to work out its size
20105,if reubens seen it he can tell us
20106,come on savage harker
20107,try and find some way to secure that door hmm
20108,wheres reuben
20109,groggy
20110,thank you very much come on leela
20111,reuben reuben are you in there      doctor
20112,because hes not listening
20113,shock can close the mind leela he could be like that for hours days even
20114,someones got to keep this place running go and tell harker to stay where he is and keep the boiler pressure up
20115,you all right
20116,good i want to talk to you vince
20117,i dont know vince but i think well find out by sunrise
20118,thats superstitious nonsense vince
20119,there are eight of us here if it attacks again well be ready and waiting all the advantage is with us eight to one
20120,so then harker keeps the boiler stoked and you stay on the siren
20121,i do
20122,no no no you stay here vince do what youve got to do
20123,hell come out when hes ready
20124,no theres no one in the lamp room except the keeper go back to the crew room
20125,get back to the crew room
20126,nothing
20127,shush
20128,survival colonel
20129,yes yours mine all of us
20130,do you find that difficult to accept colonel
20131,quite so quite so and i dont believe in mythical sea creatures either
20132,because somewhere out there is a hostile alien from a distant planet and i believe it intends to destroy us
20133,yes
20134,ive never been more serious colonel we are facing an enemy of greater power than you can dream of
20135,herbert may have a few unimportant facts wrong but his basic supposition is sound enough
20136,you think your little speck in the galaxys the only one with intelligent life hmm yes  how very interesting
20137,that was vince
20138,he says he thinks lord palmerdales fallen from the lamp gallery
20139,i agree the question is do we go out and see
20140,i do leela stay here come on
20141,harker secure the door come with me skinsale
20142,and what was he up to
20143,ah and so you came down here and wrecked the telegraph
20144,of course so to protect your honour youve put all our lives in danger
20145,oh no were on our own now
20146,murdered him i wish you had
20147,well if you had murdered palmerdale everything would have been so much simpler unfortunately he was dead before he hit the ground
20148,electrocuted he was killed by a massive electric shock in exactly the same way the keeper was
20149,oh not only can it climb sheer walls its amphibious it has some affinity with electricity and the technological ability to adapt its environment to optimum thermal levels are you following me
20150,it likes the cold
20151,but heat might be a method of defence
20152,harker
20153,get her out of here
20154,yes
20155,hes been dead for hours
20156,not reuben
20157,the chameleon factor sometimes called lycanthropy leela ive made a terrible mistake i thought id locked the enemy out instead ive locked it in with us
20158,it has but it needed to study the human life pattern first
20159,organic restructuring is elementary physiology for time lords
20160,what
20161,no not a time lord elementary physiology for us is something that lesser species might master after a few thousand centuries
20162,we dont
20163,yes but it took reubens form for a reason
20164,what is it
20165,no no no no we cant if we got within touching distance of it were dead it packs too many volts
20166,its some kind of power relay
20167,yes yes rule one after surviving a crash landing set up distress beacon to do that it would have needed a power source thats why it came here there must be a signal modulator somewhere transmitting to whom to its own kind leela get the surviving humans to the lamp room
20168,yes thats the easiest place to defend
20169,ill do the looking hurry there isnt much time
20170,wheres leela
20171,shush now listen when you reach the service room youll find a locker full of maroons i want you to break them open and scatter the powder down the lamp room stairs vincell help you off you go
20172,may i help you having trouble reuben hmm not easy holding a human form stable is it
20173,good idea youll find it a lot comfier
20174,well when youve seen one rutan youve seen them all
20175,well i expect youll get better at it in time what are you doing in this part of the galaxy anyway
20176,got it youre at last losing that interminable war with the sontarans
20177,is it you used to control the whole of the mutters spiral once now the sontarans have driven you to the far fringes of the galaxy
20178,rutan thats the empty rhetoric of a defeated dictator and i dont like your face either
20179,why invade an obscure planet like earth its of no value to you
20180,but if you set up a power base here the sontarans will bombard it with photonic missiles
20181,and what about its people
20182,i can understand your military purposes but why murder a hatful of harmless humans
20183,but you crashed didnt you just as you made your discovery you failed
20184,youre not you know
20185,im sorry to disappoint you i fixed that as well oyster face
20186,you cant be certain
20187,but by then youll be dead
20188,well if youll just step this way ill show you
20189,probably not but weve no choice im so sorry to bother you could you oblige me with a light
20190,a match
20191,thank you move over
20192,oh a little militant chitchat
20193,correct
20194,unlikely
20195,its an intelligent highly aggressive species from ruta three
20196,it evolved in the sea adapted to land any more gunpowder colonel
20197,well ruta three is an icy planet its inhabitants find heat intensely painful now if we had a flamethrower
20198,what
20199,its an early schermuly
20200,yes an early schermuly a schermuly box that fires a rocket and line
20201,yes it wont do though stay calm skinsale
20202,loaded with a few odds and ends it should cover the stairs empty your pockets and mine
20203,yes
20204,theres a whole battle fleet out there by the time the rutans and the sontarans
20205,yes by the time theyve finished with it this planetll be like a cinder hanging in space
20206,yes unless of course we could knock out both the mother ship and the scout ship if we could do that they just might conclude that this section of space was too dangerous
20207,i dont know weve nothing here that would stop a rutan spaceship in its tracks rutan ships have a crystalline infrastructure you see shielded of course still landing on a planet like this they might just cut off the energy fields to save power no id need an amplified carbon oscillator
20208,its like a laser beam but much more destructive
20209,yes
20210,well yes put in its simplest terms
20211,what
20212,that are you suggesting i convert the carbon arc beam
20213,leela thats a beautiful notion unfortunately id need a focusing device a fairly large piece of crystalline carbon
20214,yes
20215,what
20216,he did
20217,the crew room
20218,yes yes well lets get this working first
20219,good
20220,thats not necessary
20221,all right remember leela dont fire until you see the green of its tentacles
20222,with discretion come on colonel
20223,you singed my scarf
20224,dead with honour
20225,yes
20226,been celebrating have you
20227,not in my opinion i havent got time to discuss morality look out there
20228,it is when it gets within range this will lock onto its carbon resonator and knock out its antigrav i hope weve got about a hundred and seventeen seconds to get out of here understand
20229,good so when i switch on you run for it all right
20230,come on whatever you do dont look back i said dont look back lets go now
20231,thatll teach them
20232,what
20233,youre neither old nor crippled the effects of the flash will pass
20234,mmm blink thats interesting
20235,pigmentation dispersal caused by the flash your eyes have changed colour leela stop blinking now lets go
20236,blue aye though we hunted high and low and hunted everywhere
20237,the ballad of flannan isle by wilfred gibson
20238,wilfred gibson aye though we hunted high and low and hunted everywhere of the three mens fate we found no trace    doctor
20239,youve never been in here before
20240,number two control room has been closed for redecoration i dont like the colour
20241,thats the trouble with computers always think in black and white no aquamarines no blues no imagination
20242,no we havent stopped
20243,yes
20244,solar system between jupiter and saturn about five thousand ad five thousand ad were still in the time of your ancestors
20245,yes that was the year of the great breakout
20246,mmm when your forefathers went leapfrogging across the solar system on their way to the stars asteroid belts probably teeming with them now new frontiersmen pioneers waiting to spread across the galaxy like a tidal wave or a disease
20247,oh i do i do some of my best friends are humans when they get together in great numbers other lifeforms sometimes suffer
20248,as soon as ive reset these coordinates well go somewhere really interesting  lowe
20249,distress call from titan that message took half an hour to get here
20250,what does that matter whats important is that someone needs help quadrant six two whi1212 9990ex41
20251,about what
20252,hey  safran
20253,thats what
20254,what
20255,it wasnt
20256,static nothing important
20257,there was oh well a kind of saint elmos fire it happens at sea
20258,yes it causes a sort of halo effect round the masts of ships
20259,why do you keep repeating everything i say youre not a parrot are you
20260,yes a parrots a bird that repeats things move over
20261,thats it
20262,well there isnt anything wrong well there isnt anything important wrong but ive got to check it havent i
20263,come on old thing come on    nucleus
20264,hello lalee
20265,rightly perfect thank you yet lalee
20266,i said im perfectly all right thank you lalee
20267,hmm i know your name leela
20268,must have had a bot of a shik
20269,a bot of a shik
20270,theres a voice or something in my head
20271,nonsense just a nasty turn come on were on titan lets take a look
20272,what
20273,we must go weve had a mayday
20274,what intuition
20275,what are you talking about affected
20276,leela listen to me im perfectly all right move over
20277,nobody around not a soul
20278,disregard mayday he said disregard mayday why
20279,dont be gruesome
20280,youre a savage
20281,what did you say
20282,evil again
20283,wed better find it before it finds us
20284,stay here
20285,now listen whatever happens
20286,excuse me you dont know me let me introduce myself
20287,people call me the d hives
20288,are you all right i answered your mayday
20289,thats right thats right has someone been hurt
20290,what do you mean of no importance i just found a dead body out there
20291,i have arrived
20292,reject should be destroyed
20293,and breeding from my nucleus begin
20294,that is not necessary
20295,very well
20296,come on leela im waiting please leave me please i cant do it i cant do it
20297,i cant
20298,i cant
20299,the reject is here
20300,yes kill her kill her
20301,leela
20302,leela i cant stop it
20303,im fighting for my mind whatever it was that attacked safran and the others is also affecting me
20304,perhaps because oh i can feel it gathering strength to attack again
20305,some kind of organism that attacks the mind the intelligence its trying to take me over leela its trying to change me
20306,i need help i must withdraw into myself save strength
20307,vector one nine quadrant three seven four three
20308,eight zero zero
20309,hello
20310,find anything
20311,yes what have you found
20312,yes
20313,yes
20314,selfpreservation whatever it is im suffering from seems to thrive on intellectual activity
20315,yes nonthinking is the only way to shake it off but i cant stay mindless for eternity can i
20316,ah hello  k9
20317,i know what noetic means
20318,mindbrain interface
20319,but of course how stupid thats why it attacked the tardis computer first it was showing the greatest amount of mental activity i was just idling so to speak
20320,when we were first attacked we were on our way to titan i assumed it was just a static buildup then when i checked the computer it jumped into my mind and that explains why leela was
20321,why leela was unaffected have you met leela
20322,shes all instinct and intuition
20323,thats why the virus rejected her of course i begin to see it all now
20324,yes the entire crew on titan well one exception the supervisor man called lowe  k9
20325,what was that
20326,what
20327,i dont think that was an accident
20328,it must be something to do with whatevers in my head  can i have a word with you  where are you going
20329,k9 cloning techniques give me a rundown state of the art so far  k9
20330,how long how long  k9
20331,professor marius could you clone me
20332,could you clone me now
20333,yes because if you dont clone me now and the virus gets to me itll take the whole centre with it
20334,leela i shall need leela
20335,professor marius oh no not you too
20336,what that pathetic crustacean your leader
20337,finding the macro world difficult
20338,i thought id got rid of you
20339,yes youd have known about that wouldnt you
20340,ive heard it all before you megalomaniacs are all the same
20341,now nothing
20342,no we cant the dimensional stabilisers still in the isolation ward without it the tardis wont move an inch
20343,i didnt say that k9 now listen to me k9 do you think you could poleaxe do you think you could poleaxe marius  k9
20344,youre a good dog k9 good dog
20345,i had a virus then im immune now something must have happened while you and i were inside my head i want to find out what ah thats interesting you see that
20346,quite simple your clone was absorbed into my bloodstream and passed on the immunity to me all weve got to do is isolate it analyse it duplicate it and inject it into marius here and he in turn will be able to cure all the others
20347,come on one thing at a time one thing at a time
20348,sometimes my brilliance astonishes even me come on marius wake up wake up come on
20349,hes dead im afraid do you remember anything
20350,yes and no unfortunately the nucleus got away by means of the dimensional stabiliser its on its way to titan to breed
20351,yes it got to you
20352,it was something in leela something we all missed this is it youll have to cultivate a great deal more
20353,if those antibodies can confer immunity they can be used to attack the nucleus
20354,of course its dangerous if we allow the nucleus to breed and swarm itll go through the entire solar system like a plague of giant locusts
20355,yes by means of the dimensional stabiliser
20356,we cant rush these things theyre breeding as fast as they can k9 will tell us when theyve got the most powerful strain
20357,thats your answer to everything isnt it knock it on the head
20358,with what this is a hospital not an arsenal
20359,thank you k9
20360,now just get it into the tanks and wait for it to attack the nucleus in the same way it attacked us microscopically its neat dont you think
20361,i dont
20362,the virus has a perfect right to exist as a virus not as a giant storm threatening the entire solar system everything has its place otherwise the delicate balance of the whole cosmos is destroyed
20363,good now for the tardis
20364,thank you professor oh professor
20365,i dont suppose we could borrow k9 could we
20366,shush
20367,well im not at liberty to say but he could be very useful
20368,theyre starting to hatch lets go
20369,theres a man at the door
20370,theyre developing a resistance to radiation their internal cell structure  k9
20371,shall we try using our intelligence
20372,come on    k9
20373,what was that
20374,well id rather not actually
20375,oh look look they appear to be hatching are congratulations in order
20376,well done k9 well done come on lets get out of here while theres still time  k9
20377,no i lost the antibodies
20378,you have
20379,can you do that to a thousand a thousand thousand
20380,thats a good idea take k9 back to the tardis hes out of juice    nucleus
20381,yes
20382,yes methane atmosphere mix well with oxygen and run that was a good idea of mine k9 to blow it up  k9
20383,what was
20384,well then you should be feeling very happy
20385,its been a pleasure professor its been a pleasure do you know that without k9 i think wed have been part of the swarm by now
20386,what
20387,no
20388,nasty very nasty
20389,shush i dont know it will be all right it just has a little corrosion in its circuits
20390,never
20391,what did you say leela
20392,i heard what you said
20393,leela i understand the tardis perfectly theres not one single part of her that i havent adjusted or repaired at some time or another
20394,furthermore i am in complete and constant control of her
20395,someones using a sonic time scan come on old girl dont let us down now come on
20396,were being dragged towards a relative continuum displacement zone
20397,a relative continuum displacement its like a hole in time
20398,i wish i knew
20399,that depends on this misunderstood unmanageable old machine
20400,shes turning
20401,shes done it well done old girl youre wonderful wonderful shes wonderful isnt she wonderful tardis wonderful
20402,yeah well she just generates a low intensity telepathic field and obviously primitive thought patterns like yours appeal to her
20403,yes
20404,thats odd
20405,what no no no i cant calculate the coordinates
20406,well just have to trace the scan back to its source
20407,we have to stop it being used certainly otherwise itll cause a direct continuum implosion and destroy the planet its operating from
20408,it cant be oh no
20409,not that one
20410,not there
20411,earth
20412,yes your ancestors have a talent for selfdestruction that borders on genius
20413,i like your new dress
20414,its a pleasure
20415,earth
20416,oh yes oh well more or less i havent pinpointed it definitely but its certain to be around here somewhere
20417,no no no the one who leads says come on come on
20418,i did say more or less though this does look rather less than more you know i dont think these cows know anything about the time scanner never mind its a beautiful day the exercise will do us good come on
20419,hmm
20420,you must have been sent by providence
20421,no would you like a jelly baby
20422,frequently whats the nearest village
20423,fetchborough tell me about the ghosts
20424,the strangers then
20425,yes fendelman tell me about him
20426,japanese
20427,they do splendid
20428,or archaeologists where is this priory
20429,and its haunted of course
20430,shush dont you worry whats your name
20431,ted moss hmm dont you worry mister moss we wont tell a soul living or dead come on leela      mrs poo from to the manor born is being talked at by a security guard in uniform with a rifle over his shoulder say hi to  daphne heard
20432,what is it
20433,no
20434,youll upset the dog listen leela you simply must stop attacking people
20435,because youll get us into trouble
20436,what youll protect me come on well circle round the back come on
20437,the house must be that way now come on
20438,dont touch her i said dont touch her
20439,like this
20440,no no no no no you look
20441,they look like embryo fendahleen to me
20442,embryo fendahleen a creature from my own mythology supposed to have perished when the fifth planet broke up at least so they said
20443,well you saw it if it survived twelve million years its energy reserves must be enormous
20444,what well about twelve million thats when the fifth planet broke up there are four thousand million people here on your planet and if im right within a year therell be just one left alive just one
20445,whos in charge round here
20446,ah doctor fendelman i presume is that really your name fendelman now listen fendelman i want you to do two things dismantle the scanner and run some tests on miss thea start with an xray of her skull now
20447,is this the way you treat all your houseguests
20448,but she needs help
20449,tell fendelman there isnt time for all this
20450,ah parastatic magnetometer how very quaint
20451,no no
20452,how did you find me
20453,yes
20454,yes of course you did
20455,what
20456,yes i was careless come on get up come on
20457,yes its using appropriate genetic material to recreate itself
20458,shush i think its the fendahl it grows and exists by death
20459,the fendahl absorbs the full spectrum of energy what some people call a life force or soul it eats life itself
20460,what
20461,and shes still alive
20462,take me to her
20463,its indestructible
20464,no no first things first fendelman can operate that before the implosion for about a hundred hours give or take a few minutes
20465,thats a risk ill have to take come on lets go
20466,come on mrs tyler wake up
20467,do you know whats wrong with her
20468,i do make some tea
20469,tea she does drink tea
20470,off you go and make some use the best china four cups laid out on a tray off you go oh and some fruitcake
20471,no
20472,and fruitcake
20473,throw in the apple cores very hard put the lot in a shallow tin and bake in a high oven for two weeks  its too late shes slipping away come on
20474,what is it
20475,mrs tyler
20476,you were slipping away mrs tyler
20477,yes psychic shock i needed something normal to bring you back to reality how long have you lived here mrs tyler
20478,tell her im trying to help
20479,yes so youve lived in this cottage all your life havent you mrs tyler
20480,well telepathy and precognition are normal in anyone whose childhood was spent near a time fissure like the one in the wood
20481,its a weakness in the fabric of space and time every haunted place has one doesnt it thats why theyre haunted its a time distortion this one must be very large large enough to have affected the place names round here like fetchborough fetch an apparition hmm
20482,i read a lot what did you see in the wood mrs tyler
20483,then with your mind did it have a human shape
20484,mrs tyler i must know did it have a human shape
20485,mrs jack do something for me
20486,it could be dangerous
20487,i want you to keep an eye on the priory i must know who comes and goes well be back tomorrow sundown
20488,the fifth planets a hundred and seven million miles out and twelve million years back so weve no time to lose
20489,well it came from it a long time ago before your species evolved on earth
20490,what
20491,well it well it probably used that enormous stockpile of energy to project itself across space
20492,no yes well something like that humans speak of astral projection travelling psychically to different planets that could be a race memory
20493,yes you see sometimes people dream theyve been to other places its er d�j� vu no
20494,ive been checking the old data banks theres no record at all of a fifth planet
20495,well of course it matters we time lords are a very meticulous people you have to be when you live as long as we do all information is recorded
20496,what
20497,what
20498,that impressions produced by a time loop
20499,yes a time loop all memory of a planets been erased by a circle of time making data and its records invisible only a time lord could do that
20500,thats criminal weve been on a wild goose chase wed better get back lets hope were not too far round that time loop
20501,yes no no ill just set the coordinates and were on our way
20502,well of course were going to be late its obvious were going to be late im sorry im sorry the question is where is it getting the power from inducted biological transmutation takes a lot of power there isnt that sort of power available in the priory
20503,ive got it it is available in the priory the skulls absorbing the energy released when the scanner beam damages the time fissure why didnt i think of that before
20504,i cant
20505,no well i should have thought it i was frightened in childhood by a mythological horror
20506,too frightened to think clearly
20507,are you all right
20508,come on lets get out of here
20509,what
20510,shush its psychotelekinetic it controls your muscles telepathically
20511,no matter its confused that i can still move shut your eyes shut your eyes now concentrate on your legs and when i shout run
20512,run for your life
20513,rock salt
20514,well done well done that sort of controls almost impossible to break
20515,no it wasnt it was a fendahleen it was the same think that killed the hiker and mitchell it can only have been created out of pure energy while the skull was restructuring theas brain
20516,whats that for
20517,thats it leela youd better come with me jack stay with your grandma wed better find out whats going on down there
20518,im sorry
20519,put that away you almost got us killed down there
20520,shush  the darkness is it all around us
20521,come on lets have a look at the one i assaulted
20522,hmm beautiful
20523,yes sodium chloride obviously affects the conductivity ruins the overall electrical balance and prevents control of localised disruption to the osmotic pressures
20524,i just said that probably the origin of throwing it over your shoulder come on
20525,oh no that was just a lucky shot up the throat its not a throat of course
20526,true but that was just an isolated fendahleen comparatively weak whats in the cellar is the fendahl the gestalt
20527,shush got it according to the legends of gallifrey and the superstitions of this planet its fairly certain that the fendahl is made up of twelve fendahleen and a core
20528,well yes what was thea its no longer thea no more than i killed one and stael shot himself there are only ten left
20529,yes weve still got a chance jack
20530,any more of those saltfilled cartridges
20531,i need rock salt quickly
20532,mrs tyler youre wonderful jack fix those cartridges now mrs tyler i need as much salt as you can find rock salt table salt fill as many containers as you can off you go
20533,jack now listen very carefully go out into the corridor and keep watch when you see the fendahleen dont hang around give it both barrels and run off you go
20534,go with him
20535,yes
20536,mmm
20537,yes in other words the fendahl and then the time lords decided to destroy the entire planet and hid the fact from posterity theyre not supposed to do that sort of thing you know
20538,yes probably taking in mars on its way through
20539,the fendahl is death how do you kill death no what happened was this the energy amassed by the fendahl was stored in the skull and dissipated slowly as a biological transmutation field now any appropriate lifeform that came within the field was altered so that it ultimately evolved into something suitable for the fendahl to use
20540,no im saying it may have effected his evolution
20541,that would explain the dark side of mans nature but its just a theory
20542,its more fun that way
20543,almost there oh if you want an alternative explanation the fendahl fed into the rna of certain individuals the instincts and compulsions necessary to recreate these were fed through the generations till they reached fendelman and people like him
20544,or on the other hand it could all be just a coincidence finished
20545,yes yes you did youre quite right leela good marksmanship isnt a matter of luck come on
20546,shush right battle stations jack you and your grandma back to the cottage
20547,shush you know what to do
20548,good man
20549,lead lined
20550,perfect right now this is what i want you to do give leela and me time to get down to the cellar and then switch on the scanner beam with luck it should confuse things down there long enough for us to grab the skull and get away
20551,listen this is important be sure to operate the scanner beam for only two minutes then switch if off and you go
20552,because ive rigged that to set off a controlled implosion three minutes after you switch off the scanner we need three minutes to get clear
20553,pretty big big enough to blow this place to atoms
20554,oh no too dangerous it could pop up anywhere and start the whole thing over again come on
20555,psst remember three minutes
20556,no better save some for later
20557,come on ive got it lets get out of here
20558,hes switched off the scanner beam weve got three minutes come on
20559,no dont    leela
20560,down
20561,we leave vanishing priories take a lot of explaining
20562,yes probably at mrs tylers now eating plum cake off her best china
20563,hmm oh find a star about to go supernova and dump it in the vicinity
20564,oh yes i dont think even that can stand the temperatures generated by a supernova ah
20565,found one in the constellation of canthares just set the coordinates and were on our way
20566,i like your new dress
20567,oh yes it has a certain je ne je er
20568,what
20569,didnt finish what
20570,oh yes yes well its about
20571,k9 yes id better finish repairing him
20572,i can call k9 him if i want to hes my dog arent you k9    ltback to the episode listing
20573,even simple onedimensional chess exposes the limitations of the machine mind  k9
20574,what  k9
20575,leela keep still
20576,and shut up im trying to concentrate  k9
20577,what all right if you must what is it

20579,what
20580,you didnt
20581,you didnt
20582,you didnt
20583,its that confounded paint its always jamming things up stay calm im going to materialise and take a reading
20584,were still in the solar system pluto
20585,yes pluto  k9
20586,breathable atmosphere thats wrong
20587,plutos a lifeless rock leela i think you and i should take a w a l k
20588,walk  k9
20589,no no no youre not coming you stay here  k9
20590,quite warm around twenty degrees very humid
20591,its all wrong it shouldnt be like earth unless of course the suns turned nova
20592,fascinating
20593,what
20594,dont touch him
20595,magnificent view isnt it how high is this building
20596,a thousand metres my are we interrupting something
20597,somehow i have the impression youre thinking of killing yourself
20598,what
20599,oh the taxes my dear old thing all you need is a wiley accountant would you care for a jelly baby hmm try one
20600,theyre rather good
20601,he cant make ends meet probably too many economists in the government
20602,well roughly speaking but paying tax is more painful
20603,well if little cordos at all typical they havent any spirit left for fighting
20604,what
20605,suns
20606,pity k9 cant bark
20607,what is it
20608,for someone who wanted to commit suicide a few minutes ago you seem very anxious not to be caught
20609,come on leela
20610,i dont know why did you run
20611,thats no answer
20612,i dont know odd isnt it
20613,he says youre right
20614,well come with you
20615,no im interested in this undercity always like to get to the bottom of things
20616,he means theres no night on this planet leela thats why the concept of darkness frightens him
20617,not if the sidereal and axial rotation periods are the same or if theres more than one sun
20618,what six suns on pluto
20619,instation fusion satellites galileo would have been impressed
20620,which way
20621,well go on
20622,too late
20623,you did not catch us we allowed you to escort us
20624,really how many other planets have you been to
20625,i can see were going to get on famously
20626,do you think hes insulting me
20627,no
20628,shush we havent come here to fight we havent come here to fight

20632,hmm
20633,well im delighted to oh no no were just tourists were not staying
20634,oh good
20635,a thousand talmars stolen
20636,stolen
20637,hmm what do these ajacks look like if im pretending to be one i ask merely for information
20638,er computer microloaded er do you feed it into a reader
20639,subway thirty seven
20640,what suppose i refuse to go
20641,it was just a passing thought
20642,it was a bit stuffy but unscented
20643,nothing just an idea k9  k9
20644,tens please  he waves to cordo then a door slams down locking the doctor inside the cubicle and an alarm sounds            mandrell

20650,go on
20651,ah
20652,so you carried on taking them
20653,what does pcm stand for
20654,what
20655,enough to recognise an anxiety inducing agent when i smell one
20656,thats what they tell you it also eliminates freedom
20657,tell me bisham how do they spread the pcm through the atmosphere
20658,i should think so too do you know how long weve been sitting here without any attention at all do you know that
20659,ah right im glad he isnt deaf
20660,oh thats all right bisham well have another opportunity to talk theres a lot you can tell me
20661,i wouldnt touch that if i were you
20662,not long im afraid theres no need to hurry on our account take a break or something have a cup of tea have some jelly babies there are some in my coat pocket no all right
20663,ah thank you i dont like this jacket not very comfortable i like a jacket with a lot of pockets dont you whats the next treat going to be hmm whats your name
20664,gatherer hade

20667,yes especially for an ajack
20668,indeed but how very clever of you to know my name
20669,ah
20670,oh not at all not at all your guards were entirely charming and so attentive
20671,to forgive is fine
20672,oh thank you thank you thank you
20673,have you ever tasted raspberry leaf tea awfully good for aliments of the throat
20674,yes
20675,remarkable
20676,i can hardly credit it
20677,mind you ive often wondered why we left old earth
20678,not long no
20679,well i shall certainly try in fact i shall start right now
20680,humbug
20681,suppertime save me some
20682,well i was i was but it was all a misunderstanding gatherer apologised profusely shush
20683,no trick gave me a raspberry leaf as well wheres leela
20684,what
20685,mandrell you made a certain threat before i left if anythings happened to that girl
20686,once upon a time there were three sisters
20687,good
20688,maybe he liked my face
20689,ah thats a catch question with a brain your size you dont think right
20690,or we can do it the hard way ive heard that one too
20691,well even gatherers have their bad days
20692,about what
20693,i only made one deal mandrell and that was with you under duress and you havent kept your part of it
20694,yes that sort of subtle approach is always more effective than crude violence
20695,youre a fool mandrell i dont know why yet but i was released from the correction centre the gatherer gave me a cock and bull story about machine error and he gave me a thousand talmars to make it sound convincing thats all i know
20696,youre not very good at it mandrell
20697,its the eyes no conviction
20698,oh put it aside mandrell you look a fool
20699,three

20701,ha
20702,thank you gentlemen
20703,no no im not im not goudry im asking you to help yourselves nothing will change round here unless you change it
20704,you cant do anything but there are fifty million people in this city think how the guards will react to that number
20705,given the chance to breathe clean air for a few hours they might have you thought of that
20706,theres always a way come here
20707,two hundred and five centigrade so if we lower the temperature in the chamber
20708,what
20709,how do you know that
20710,you mean take over main control
20711,only your claims
20712,oh it was nothing i have a gift for the apt phrase
20713,theres no if about it cordo we will
20714,first of all weve got to blind the scanner system at the moment its sensitised on me so i cant move from this spot
20715,well every few metres along the subway there are tubes in the walls
20716,no i mean the oculoid electronic monitors theyre connected to concealed cables cordo i want two of them brought here
20717,cordo
20718,take care i mean unplug them carefully
20719,yes
20720,what is this company can anyone tell me that
20721,shush i mean who runs it whats it for
20722,a profit
20723,but who gets the profit where does it go
20724,wouldnt it be interesting to find the answer
20725,cordo take these theyre ready
20726,now listen bisham and mandrell stay with me now the rest of you i want you to scatter through the city and tell the people whats happening remind them that theyre human beings and tell them that human beings always have to fight for their freedom all right
20727,you all know what to do
20728,lets go
20729,good
20730,well i fixed a static loop what else mandrell you lead the way cordo second bisham third k9 fifth

20735,come here bisham listen i mandrell mandrell what would happen if we cut the water supply to the pumps
20736,no no no just for a few minutes just long enough to get her out
20737,so we let that pressure out
20738,why not
20739,what what is it  k9
20740,k9 i dont know how to say this k9  k9

20763,what that poof its just a knack youve either got it or you havent
20764,what is it
20765,what like a spider in the middle of a web
20766,i understand all this he has a computer feeding and analysing the daily returns from each megropolis suppose suppose he wants to broadcast some pleasing bit of news hmm like the imposition of a double vision tax on people with more than one eye well then he feeds it into there
20767,he did
20768,that should do it
20769,what that its a safe company vault
20770,shush
20771,what was that
20772,neither did i
20773,i always whisper when im opening safes what is it
20774,i dont know it always looks so easy
20775,i dont know
20776,oh i was just checking the books
20777,im not the auditor im the doctor
20778,no i wont kill you just close you down
20779,oh delighted delighted
20780,yes i cut the answering service not to interrupt our little conference
20781,tell me about the company
20782,yes
20783,yes cut the sales talk wheres the head office
20784,ah i might have guessed from your squiddy little eyes hmm
20785,oh yes oh yes the usurians are listed in professor thripsteds flora and fauna of the universe under poisonous fungi
20786,quite mad mad as a hatter
20787,go on
20788,and then taxed the life out of them i mean to recover your capital costs
20789,phew what about the four intervening planets
20790,so then you really put the screws on i mean the running costs must be very high
20791,six suns six my my and so when this planets exhausted you can move your slave labour force elsewhere
20792,leaving the humans to die
20793,you bloodsucking leech you wont stop until you own the entire galaxy will you dont you think commercial imperialism is as bad as military conquest
20794,you
20795,oh wake up wake up look at the facts
20796,you and a handful of bureaucrats wont put the people back in chains now
20797,oh its you again what did i say
20798,rain stops play i dont think thatll damp down this revolution
20799,except you
20800,no but this chap at my shoulder he breathes air
20801,dont be a fool
20802,good throw good throw
20803,youll like this bit youll like it
20804,cordo i dont think hes listening
20805,i do hes gone back to his natural form he was only held in that state by particle radiation thats why he never left that machine
20806,oh yes

20837,yeah well the minyans thought of us as gods you see which was all very flattering and we were new at spacetime explorations so we thought we could help we gave them medical and scientific aid better communications better weapons
20838,kicked up out at gunpoint then they went to war with each other learnt how to split the atom discovered the toothbrush and finally split the planet

20880,its all right leela
20881,no
20882,listen jackson listen
20883,jackson two four zero takes us right back into the nebula
20884,but that could mean destruction
20885,but p7e didnt go in there she couldnt have she must have been there at the beginning and the nebula formed around her
20886,its elementary physics the still centre of a raging storm p7e might be in there and she might be safe but if you go in after her it could mean destruction
20887,jackson i cant allow that
20888,what k9 stop
20889,were going on k9  k9
20890,jackson listen to me this is hopeless
20891,were being sucked through a layer of meteorites theyre smashing us to pieces
20892,i said theyre smashing us to piece
20893,dont you know whats the normal hull thickness
20894,k9 present hull thickness  k9
20895,were being turned into a planet
20896,no its not impossible jackson its simply gravity this ships a large heavy object surrounded by smaller lighter objects our gravitational pull is greater than theirs we attract them they stick to us it all snowballs  k9
20897,i dont know you could try the laser cannon
20898,mmm
20899,carry on herrick
20900,carry on herrick
20901,herrick keep on
20902,thats the p7e

20904,right in the middle the planet formed around it
20905,full speed  k9
20906,you can relax now relax everyone its a soft planet in the process of formation only the core will be solid and with any luck this stuff should slow us down so we dont hit it with too much of a bang    k9
20907,fascinating the quest and nothing but the quest
20908,well jackson
20909,solid rock
20910,igneous hematite that means were at the core
20911,well old ones like earth yes but new ones have a molten slurry round a solid core all we have to do is burrow our way out of here and enter the core
20912,i dont know about that what about a shield gun
20913,give it a blast hold it like that i think
20914,get on with it jackson
20915,the quest is the quest
20916,of course
20917,of course
20918,oh hell be all right hes building up his strength
20919,hmm radiation
20920,not at all igneous rock core new planet bound to be radiation luck physics isnt luck physics is fact are facts is fact anyway why do you think these tunnels were dug out
20921,exactly energy cant survive on a new planet with a soul full of hope and fresh air you know
20922,shush shall we go
20923,thats right did you know the people there absorb more radiation from the granite than people who work every day in nuclear power plants
20924,well of course it is it shows that organisms can adapt to any kind of environment even one like this with a high radiation count
20925,i dont know ill ask him

21179,tea
21180,i know what tea is
21181,see youre too singleminded youre as transparent as good old fashioned glass

21196,and yourselves i hope i find it disconcerting talking to shimmering shapes
21197,naturally naturally well castellan the chancellor doesnt seem too keen to help how about you
21198,i thought you would you can start by making sure that no one organises any resistance thats the last thing i want
21199,good listen why dont you regard yourself as acting vicepresident
21200,and youd better make me a list of all time lords holding official positions and let me know which ones you think are reliable
21201,thats the stuff off you go
21202,yes a jelly baby my right hand pocket
21203,orange

21207,is the curfew effective
21208,what a splendidly subservient citadel you do run castellan
21209,have you brought the list
21210,so these time lords are the only potential rebels to our new regime hmm
21211,you have
21212,hmm i should thing so too well if these are the only threats to our new regime wed better do something about them
21213,oh i hardly think so they may be persuaded to see reason and some of them might be useful to us
21214,oh but there is
21215,yes expulsion
21216,none of them can survive out there without help and theres no help out there
21217,naturally well see to it castellan oh and castellan if i were you id put them out one by one
21218,good
21219,isnt it time we shared a bit of trust i mean couldnt you materialise and have a jelly baby
21220,oh

21244,im the living proof im not i dont know what they teach you at the academy these days but if you cant pull off a simple palace revolution what can you pull off hmm
21245,yes and its going to stay jammed until the invaders have gone  you see while im in here they cant touch me and they cant read my thoughts
21246,yes and materialise at the end of it but until they do materialise i cant identify their planet of origin and time loop it
21247,well i do talk to myself sometimes yes
21248,oh oh that old thing yeah theres a problem there ive been under a bit of a strain recently you see the matrix has been invaded
21249,yes
21250,shush because they can read thoughts even encephalographic patterns thats why ive plugged k9 into the matrix instead of me hes got no brains you see sorry about that k9
21251,this one i can hes my second best friend
21252,hmm  it might just work give me your helmet
21253,that should keep them guessing
21254,yes i built a partial encephalographic barrier into it itll keep your deepest thoughts hidden but youre going to have to concentrate can you do that
21255,good
21256,never mind  k9
21257,im going to dismantle the forcefield around gallifrey
21258,its the only way to convince them that were really cooperating
21259,yes
21260,i cant but rassilon can
21261,yes
21262,thats right but his mind lives on in the apc net im part of that net now rassilon built the forcefield maybe he can dismantle it
21263,exactly which is why its the only way to convince them how do you feel about that
21264,ive been thinking about it very hard but i need to contact
21265,thats right
21266,yes
21267,well it doesnt look too difficult well dont stare at me this is a very delicate operation youre making me nervous
21268,its impossible to destroy the forcefield without atomising the entire planet but i have made a sizeable hole in it above the citadel
21269,well id need to do a little more work on it to achieve that
21270,mmm disappointing arent they nice to see you again
21271,no i can manage very nicely thank you
21272,would you like to assist me in my work its er its this way

21337,if you wanted to hide a tree where would you hide it in a forest i read your essay on reason
21338,no rassilon was a wily old bird no president without the great key can have absolute power correct so to protect the time lords from dictatorship he gave the key into the hands of a chancellor
21339,i know ive been there you havent theres no record in the matrix of any president knowing the whereabouts of the great key so who does not the castellan hes just a jumped up guard but who guards the guards

21673,all right no you do it go on you do it ill just stand here and watch
21674,the first segment simple wasnt it only five more to go  ltback to the episode listing
21675,there you are k9 the first segment of the key to time a job well done    k9
21676,what are you reading
21677,capsule what kind of a word is that if you mean tardis why dont you say tardis
21678,not on the syllabus i dont know what the academys coming to these days
21679,really like what
21680,now youre being frivolous
21681,oh no
21682,how paralysingly dull boring and tedious
21683,yes calufrax
21684,yes mean little planet still listen why dont you watch while i set the coordinate on this vintage veteran of mine maybe youll learn something
21685,hmm
21686,what about it
21687,no no no i never bother about that complete waste of time
21688,listen have you any idea how long ive been operating this tardis
21689,right is it really that long my how time flies
21690,what
21691,oh absolute rubbish
21692,she wont materialise  k9
21693,no no no no nothing at all
21694,not so i am perfectly capable of admitting when i am wrong
21695,yes only this time i wasnt there was definitely something out there jamming our materialisation field
21696,yes yes thats what it was yes whatever it was it wasnt a multiloop whatsit or anything else to do with that manual
21697,what by the book
21698,yes all right all right you do it your way
21699,youll see theres definitely something out there jamming our materialisation field
21700,wont make a scrap of difference
21701,look out k9 hold on
21702,good
21703,that was very very good wasnt that good k9  k9
21704,oh all right then lets get it over with horrible place cold wet icy no life of any sort boring
21705,what calufrax you have made an enormous mistake youve probably youve probably missed it by a couple of million light years
21706,cant be right it is right but it cant be can it
21707,well according to these space time coordinates we have arrived at precisely the right point in space at precisely the right time
21708,but to the wrong planet
21709,this isnt calufrax
21710,i havent got the faintest idea all i do know is that this planet wasnt here when i tried to land
21711,yes
21712,never trust gimmicky gadgets  k9
21713,its all right it just means someones coming
21714,no no excuse me ill do it
21715,is she whats that got to do with it
21716,excuse me
21717,excuse me
21718,thank you very much excuse me
21719,sweets you eat them go on
21720,er excuse me what id like to know where did you get those jelly babies
21721,where
21722,look good looks are no substitute for a sound character did he say anything about omens
21723,really
21724,i think that these stones are genuine what do you think k9  k9
21725,diamonds and rubies not valuable
21726,oolian  k9
21727,yeah hold it up to the light people have murdered for that beauty ravaged empires for it and lying in the streets exactly where i wasnt expecting to find it i wonder where calufrax got to
21728,excuse me have you seen calufrax
21729,over there you stay here ill go and see
21730,excuse me are you sure this planets meant to be here
21731,hes in a state of shock
21732,what every time
21733,hmm tell me about this captain pleasant sort of chap is he  mula weve never seen him
21734,really thats a very interesting observation
21735,mentiads ive heard that somewhere before
21736,no no no its all right its all right its a friend of mine arent you a friend of mine k9  k9
21737,pralix what do the mentiads want of you what is it
21738,how long have you stunned them for k9  k9
21739,pralix pralix what is it
21740,pralix can you hear my voice
21741,pralix pralix can you hear my voice what is it hello hello are you by any chance the mentiads well its just that you look like mentiads to me
21742,shush  k9
21743,i wasnt asking you what hit me k9  k9
21744,dont worry dont worry ill find him
21745,do you know where the mentiads live
21746,they whos they
21747,youre not frightened
21748,you just didnt get round to it is that it
21749,so will i
21750,not now k9 not now now k9 can you track the mentiads by their psychospore  k9
21751,all right all right romana romana wheres romana  k9
21752,no one
21753,right heads we go after romana first tails we go after pralix first hmm
21754,heads
21755,two kings on aldebaran three
21756,oh yes it is if my guess is correct romanas in much greater danger than pralix now how do we get to this bridge
21757,but mula
21758,no no no you stay here
21759,i need you here itll be all right k9  k9
21760,how do we get to it
21761,one of those is it how do the guards get there
21762,aircars
21763,aircars
21764,help me borrow it
21765,well i dont mind going first class do you
21766,come on
21767,youre not free yet
21768,tell me about those mines
21769,who goes down them do you go down
21770,mentiads
21771,no one
21772,what happens when they run out
21773,what just like that
21774,wrong its an economic miracle of course its wrong
21775,what lights
21776,do you mean the stars
21777,might be the way to the bridge
21778,no i save planets mostly but this time i think ive arrived far far too late
21779,well
21780,huh impossible that means itll take seventy three seconds we can ill afford it move over
21781,well of course i can open it its just a question of how
21782,i havent got the faintest idea
21783,i havent finished yet bent hairpin the more sophisticated the technology the more vulnerable it is to primitive attack people often overlook the obvious
21784,shall we go
21785,yes it certainly looks like it
21786,come on
21787,go out to the aircar fetch the guards gun
21788,stand outside on guard
21789,no no no no no thats the most valuable thing you can do there are so many things here you cant understand and a linear induction corridor is one of them
21790,hello hello
21791,im the doctor delighted to meet you heard so much about what a splendid chap you are i see i see youve met my assistant romana getting on like a house on fire are you shes a lovely girl what a splendid place youve got here are you having a spot of bother
21792,such hospitality im underwhelmed
21793,my manners are impeccable
21794,macromat field integrator has the whizzbang gone wrong
21795,and the amblicyclic photon would you mind if i examined its locus
21796,locus
21797,whoa look at that romana
21798,no actually not like this
21799,really i suspected something of the kind come on lets look busy
21800,shush
21801,gravitic anomalising input reading nine point five  nine point five
21802,i mean i had my suspicions
21803,more or less yes
21804,well i just put one point seven nine five three seven two and two point two oh four six two eight together
21805,four
21806,romana
21807,we are in very very very great danger
21808,yes
21809,the captain is a very clever and very dangerous man hes playing with us he wants to find out why weve come here
21810,is the only way to find it what does the tracer say
21811,what thats it then
21812,the answer romana weve stumbled on one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in this galaxy weve got to get out of here and get out of here quickly come on
21813,sabotage captain its more than my reputations worth
21814,or my life as you say yes yes weve got to go back to our own ship now and prepare some special equipment
21815,well im afraid thats not possible you see we have a special lock fitted to the tardis door and it requires the physical presence of both of us to open it thats clever dont you think
21816,its a pleasure to work with you captain well come on dont just stand there escort us
21817,and now this happens
21818,weve got a lot of travelling to do
21819,to investigate your miraculous mines come on    k9
21820,huh i can see there wouldnt be much incentive
21821,about three miles beneath the surface of zanak id say
21822,yes
21823,yes and wet and icy ah romana this entire planets hollow
21824,yes hollow hollow cant you work it out go on take a look go on look look you all right
21825,come here and listen now listen kimus the reason the stars in your sky change is because they dont
21826,no your entire planet jumps through space
21827,yes those engines huge enough to dematerialise an entire hollow planet flip it halfway across the galaxy and rematerialise it round its chosen prey
21828,yes like a huge fist its one huge mining machine that mines planets extracts all the valuable minerals and leaves the rubble behind
21829,is the planet we originally came looking for
21830,buried inside zanak the pirate planet and having the goodness sucked out of it
21831,whole other worlds
21832,the oolian stone i picked up in the street bandraginus five i knew id heard that name somewhere before i remember now about a hundred years ago it disappeared without trace a planet of a thousand million souls captain fodder
21833,yes
21834,yes i thought so
21835,i thought as much
21836,exciting isnt it
21837,hello k9 surprised to see us  k9
21838,its names the captain you know that why havent you kicked him out
21839,a gestalt a telepathic gestalt
21840,yes zanaks just a shell of a planet a complete hollow
21841,yes but very rarely empty now listen there are vast transmat engines hidden underneath the captains mountain
21842,yes but you dont notice that you see because youre part of it now listen at almost the same moment it vanishes it rematerialises in another part of the galaxy around another slightly smaller planet
21843,yes so your planet
21844,yes so your planet
21845,yes having materialised around the other planet smothers it crushes it and mines all the mineral wealth out of it
21846,yes
21847,yes the omens mean the death of another planet
21848,come on thats not necessarily evil ive known hundreds of people whove lived for hundreds
21849,what
21850,shush k9 shush please carry on
21851,hmm tell me how did he arrive
21852,and needed pretty extensive surgery by the look of him i wonder who did that
21853,not now k9 not now go on
21854,yes well they would for someone who was telepathic
21855,yes yes i do you were absorbing what you would call the life force from the plundered planets
21856,well er well its quite difficult to explain simple terms but basically romana
21857,oh enormous
21858,right
21859,thats right you mentiads were absorbing all that power into your brains
21860,what is it k9  k9
21861,well they say you can fool some of the people all of the time lets see shall we
21862,hands up
21863,have i told you my plan no more janis thorns no more janis thorns i think it should work really quite well i think argh
21864,you wont get away with it you know
21865,at the moment nothing at all but it does my morale no end of good just to say it ive been tied to pillars by better men than you captain
21866,vicious ha dont panic kimus dont panic
21867,youre just trying to shut me up you cant kill me while im helpless
21868,no you cant because youre a warrior and its against the warriors code you should have thought of that before you tied me up
21869,hard to listen isnt it captain when someones got a finger on a nerve what is it youre really up to what do you want you dont want to take over the universe do you no you wouldnt know what to do with it beyond shout at it
21870,he said release me
21871,what are they tombstones memorials to all the worlds youve destroyed
21872,you come here on the wanton destruction youve wreaked on the universe
21873,did you just say the entire remains of the worlds themselves
21874,thats impossible that amount of matter in so small a space would undergo instant gravitational collapse and form a black hole
21875,what but zanak would be dragged into a gravitational whirlpool
21876,then its the most brilliant piece of astrogravitational engineering ive ever seen the concept is simply staggering pointless but staggering
21877,appreciate it appreciate it what you commit mass destruction and murder on a scale thats almost inconceivable and you ask me to appreciate it just because you happen to have made a brilliantly conceived toy out of the mummified remains of planets
21878,whats it for huh what are you doing what could possibly be worth all this
21879,would you like to put me down
21880,that should be fun
21881,kimus are you all right
21882,for goodness sake get him down he hasnt done you any harm captain
21883,were on the bridge
21884,thats your beloved captain
21885,oh it looks like a psychic interference transmitter
21886,well its a sort of machine for neutralising psychic power
21887,nonsense captain nonsense to make that machine work youd need a collection of the most rare crystals
21888,oh yes voolium
21889,madranite one five
21890,and as far as i know they occur naturally on only one planet and thats
21891,my biorhythms must be at an all time low
21892,they are
21893,no no no dont dont
21894,come back k9 come back
21895,never mind about that lets find another way out
21896,yes
21897,never
21898,not completely but they can slow down the flow of time in the space between given enough energy
21899,thats your beloved queen xanxia
21900,oh no shes not shes suspended in the last few seconds of life
21901,no she cant
21902,no not while shes between those two things there
21903,to find enough energy to fuel those dams youd need to ransack entire planets
21904,yes there must be something more to it than that
21905,yes would you go to those lengths just to stay alive
21906,no not in that condition but in what condition what shush
21907,ive got a job for you two now listen over there theres a service elevator it must go down to the engine room
21908,so so you and k9 are going down in the lift to the engine room to sabotage the engines all right  k9
21909,im going to see to the captain
21910,all right all right all right i give up
21911,yes im afraid i seem unable to break the habit
21912,my colleagues
21913,im sorry about that but it was becoming an infernal nuisance
21914,er captain i think youd better hear what i have to say first ahem i mean i think when you hear what ive got to say youll change your mind
21915,please listen
21916,please listen
21917,you cant be serious is he
21918,but please
21919,hello everybody
21920,sorry i couldnt make the jump myself ive got a terrible head for heights
21921,neat little machine isnt it and the image it projects might almost be real    doctor 2
21922,so xanxia the tyrant queen of zanak
21923,what about the real you that wizened old body in the time dams back there
21924,oh no no no not yet it isnt your new bodys based on a cell projection system i think
21925,ah but its still unstable isnt it youre still dependant on the last few seconds of life in the old body
21926,it wont work you know believe me im an old hand at regenerations it cant be done that way those time dams back there they just wont work
21927,bafflegab my dear ive never heard such bafflegab in all my lives
21928,yes
21929,no captain captain listen to me this concerns you youre being used you know youre being used by her just to do her dirty work and whats your reward captain eternal life
21930,enough to know it cant be sustained by those time dams back there
21931,it never will not ever
21932,are wrong
21933,inevitable because they are based on a false promise
21934,what next suns its no good the energy needs of the time dams increase exponentially there just isnt enough energy in the universe to keep them going for ever in the end youll die
21935,i just dont think its worth all that effort what do you think mister fibuli captain what do you think captain
21936,pjx one eight but well thats quartz
21937,yes but from where where
21938,earth earth do you really mean to go on with this madness but captain earth is an inhabited planet
21939,you cant possibly succeed the mentiads will destroy you
21940,what that
21941,its all right ill close it
21942,no i sent them to sabotage the engines the planets about to jump again
21943,yes i know i know theyve got a psychic interference transmitter on the bridge
21944,wheres k9
21945,listen you and mula stay here and cover us the rest of us the engine room
21946,i dont know
21947,he said theres a power cable right behind me quick open his inspection hatch
21948,thats it k9 can you divert any of this current into your frequency projectors  k9
21949,what enough to open a door
21950,more power k9 more power
21951,yes
21952,thats right and if we couldnt materialise then neither can zanak quick back to the tardis k9 keep generating power pralix
21953,read my mind what can you see
21954,right
21955,right right now whatever happens you keep concentrating on my mind come on romana weve got a planet to save
21956,a bent fork
21957,i havent the vaguest idea
21958,cover your heads were almost there
21959,no no no wait a minute the inertia neutraliser you know i think the conservation of momentum is a very important law in physics dont you
21960,i dont think anyone should tamper with it do you
21961,no nor do i
21962,old isaac friend of mine on earth he discovered gravity well i say he discovered gravity i had to give him a bit of a prod
21963,climbed up a tree
21964,dropped an apple on his head
21965,no no he told me to clear off out of his tree i explained it to him afterwards at dinner
21966,going in to land
21967,this is the most dangerous manoeuvre the tardis has ever attempted dont take it personally old girl just try and survive now earth coordinates
21968,good multiloop stabiliser synchronic feedback
21969,thats a good point now listen zanak could try to dematerialise at any moment weve got to be spot on youll man the warp oscilloscope and the gravity dilation meter
21970,theyll both peak when zanak goes into demat and remat mode then brace yourself
21971,itll go on getting worse until one of us explodes or the mentiads raise that door
21972,im opening a communications channel
21973,switch off the tardis forcefield
21974,i know do it
21975,and you    pralix
21976,pralix pralix do you have the strength to raise the door yet  pralix
21977,you can never relax for a moment in this job
21978,yes the question is will we ever be able to do anything else again shall we try and materialise
21979,come on
21980,yes thats her the old harpy
21981,yes any interference in the time dam field though would trigger off an explosion that would blast us off this planet
21982,i think we adapt the captains plan
21983,the captains trophy room well what do you think
21984,yes obviously all the forces cancel each other perfectly otherwise poof
21985,yes let that be a lesson to you my girl never take anything at its face value
21986,the captains plan we must be able to use it
21987,yes
21988,right
21989,here they are all perfectly balanced out
21990,right
21991,and it wouldnt have worked anyway
21992,yes but calufrax isnt
21993,is not a normal planet its an artificially metricised structure consisting of a substance with a variable atomic weight
21994,is the second segment of the key to time
21995,try it now
21996,the tracer you have still got it
21997,what
21998,not if i do something immensely clever
21999,no captain dont dont do it it wont work
22000,no please i can explain everything
22001,no one else come in no one else
22002,well the captain certainly is but xanxias another matter youd all better get out of here this place is pretty unstable get down to the foot of the mountain
22003,its all right ill follow on later off you go
22004,well ive got a couple of things to do here please go please go go
22005,now captain let me see
22006,youll never believe it
22007,all right i will ive switched the captains circuits around to create a hyperspatial force shield around the shrunken planets then i put his dematerialisation control into remote mode
22008,precisely
22009,what well first i dematerialise the tardis then i make zanak dematerialise for a millisecond or two then i invert the gravity field of the hyperspatial forceshield and drop the shrunken planets
22010,exactly
22011,well i would have thought that was perfectly obvious they expand in an instant to fill a hollow space and bang
22012,well naturally calufrax is flung off into the space time vortex and we pick it up later in the tardis
22013,quite ingenious its brilliant its fantastic
22014,fantastic right here we go then there
22015,clever eh
22016,yes
22017,me
22018,bridge and time k9  k9
22019,oh its a bit crude but immensely satisfying
22020,i dont see why not its entirely up to you youve got to make this world a better place to live in youve got plenty of material wealth but there are other things the other lead romana
22021,thank you  now i think this is a good place in the universe to settle down youve got reasonable sun good neighbours and some quite convenient stars for when you get round to ordinary space travel i think youre going to be all right here
22022,good next  what i want to know is am i going to blow up that bridge or are you
22023,good ill get out of the way while you concentrate
22024,what
22025,puzzles you dont call that a puzzle do you
22026,it certainly isnt
22027,right
22028,have i got a treat in store for you romana  romana
22029,oh sorry not yet not yet what does she mean not yet what do you mean not yet  romana
22030,ravishing
22031,oh yes very nicely i should think except for those shoes
22032,well you please yourself im no fashion expert
22033,its a warning and a reminder
22034,if shed been meant to know he would have told her
22035,what
22036,if something happened to me yes i suppose you have a point yes i dont really think its fair
22037,romana you were not sent on this mission by the president of the supreme council
22038,no no you werent
22039,the voice you just heard and the being you saw in the shape of the president was the white guardian or to be more accurate the guardian of light and time as opposed to the guardian of darkness sometimes called the black guardian they can assume any shape or form they wish
22040,yes thats why our mission is so vital romana the key of time is so powerful that it must not be allowed to fall into the hands of any one being its been broken up into six segments and the segments scattered through the universe and disguised as other objects
22041,because there are times when the forces within the universe upset the cosmic balance so badly that the entire universe is in danger of eternal chaos
22042,thats what the white guardian said when its fully assembled and activated it stops everything
22043,yes so that the white guardian can restore the balance
22044,rapidly
22045,thats your surprise weve landed
22046,i thought youd be pleased
22047,how do you know that
22048,i didnt tell everybody that
22049,youll like it its pretty civilised on the whole
22050,do you mean its raining
22051,ah well thats what the locals call a soft day
22052,any one for tennis
22053,yes its an english expression it means is anyone coming outdoors to get soaked
22054,you know i do believe its going to be a nice day after all
22055,yes pretty isnt it
22056,lets go
22057,these are
22058,exactly
22059,why they dont have very heavy elephants around here it must weigh at least three and a half tons
22060,would you
22061,yes you know
22062,yes that looks promising
22063,well its a stone circle
22064,well its a sort of megalithic temple cum observatory
22065,just stones yes theyre just stones theyre all aligned with various points on the horizon giving you sunrise and moonrise at different times of the year
22066,what primitive no not now thousands of years ago when these were built
22067,very and clever with some of these circles you could even calculate eclipses
22068,i dont know try
22069,i beg your pardon
22070,ah
22071,well
22072,doctor
22073,fougous
22074,who are you
22075,oh the definitive work on the subject
22076,i do beg your pardon thats my assistant romana
22077,so is this

22171,his entire circuits nearly all burnt out
22172,oh nonsense k9 nonsense were not going to turn you into scrap yet are we romana
22173,his only chance is an entire circuit regeneration how can we do that in time to save him it might be kinder to remove the cerebral core now
22174,what can we do
22175,what
22176,yes of course it was all type fortys were
22177,brilliant
22178,what well i mean its quite ingenious anyway its worth a try

22180,de vries and the woman theyve been killed by that creature you heard what k9 said
22181,its globulin deficient
22182,its a protein found in blood plasma the creature that kills them lives on blood
22183,anything
22184,nothing ive searched the whole house completely empty no secret passages no hidden rooms nothing its got to be here though
22185,well the cailleach
22186,yes

22211,three of the stones are missing
22212,one went over the cliff remember
22213,yes she called them the ogri ogri of course the ogri how silly of me
22214,yes from ogros their home planet thats in tau ceti repulsive place covered in great swamps full of amino acids primitive proteins which they feed on by absorption hence their need of globulin
22215,which is the nearest equivalent on earth hence the blood sacrificed on the stones anyway you know all about the ogri on earth
22216,thats right
22217,gog magog ogres they cant be far away anyway you and i have got work to do listen do you by any chance have any tritium crystals
22218,yes tritium crystals tritium crystals
22219,professor listen you go back to the cottage and see if you can find any crystals ill go back to my tardis and see if i can pick up a few things
22220,professor i dont know thats why i need the crystals
22221,mmm well done professor i knew she must have them somewhere its the only way she could power that wand of hers
22222,hyperspace
22223,now now k9 k9 dont overstrain your databanks youre not fully recovered yet  k9
22224,well who does  k9
22225,well im not surprised they gave up teaching it two thousand years ago even on gallifrey
22226,here look how can i explain listen einsteins special theory of relativity said
22227,yes yes well he was nearly right
22228,yes absurd isnt it
22229,i always thought it was fun myself i did try to explain the realities to poor old albert but he would insist that he knew best
22230,no thats all right i mean apart from space warping which he couldnt possibly understand there is a theoretical way of avoiding the time distort
22231,yes just pass me that screwdriver will you yes you operate in a different dimension you see in another kind of space
22232,yes
22233,listen theyre still in the circle or whatever occupies that space in the other dimension
22234,good perhaps youll explain it to me sometime when youve got a few minutes to spare
22235,yes
22236,well i dont see how i can stop you asking
22237,no
22238,im more from what youd call inner time
22239,yes well never mind about that now k9 what do you think of this hmm well  k9
22240,right now remember youve only got thirty seconds and then pow
22241,yes pow pow pow is a technical expression professor it means that all the microcircuitry will fuse into one great urgh of molten metal
22242,ah well thats where k9 comes in you see hell generate a forcefield a touch more sophisticated than miss fays and that should keep them out for a while
22243,there you are now if they should break through run as if something very nasty were after you because something very nasty will be after you
22244,dont worry about me ill be doing plenty of that in any case
22245,you just switch on for thirty seconds say every half hour
22246,well of course itll work and even if it doesnt work what does it matter you know what they say about hyperspace
22247,they say its a theoretical absurdity and thats something ive always wanted to be lost in ready now switch on
22248,now
22249,all right all right all right were not all programmed for perfection you know ah theres the fault  k9
22250,nearly finished there that should do it lets hope it works this time  k9
22251,yes  k9
22252,now
22253,romana romana
22254,well in strict order of asking busy nothing hyperspace your friend doesnt look too well what happened to you
22255,why not
22256,yes except apparently the people who built this ship four thousand years ago its a hyperspace vessel
22257,come on
22258,theres your answer
22259,because it exists in a different kind of space from the circle
22260,yes
22261,maybe it ran out of fuel
22262,why
22263,perhaps someones been spring cleaning
22264,yeah romana romana theres plenty of fuel the drive units still working
22265,on what
22266,yes wed better search the ship the third segment must be here somewhere to say nothing of our friend miss fay
22267,what after four thousand years i shouldnt think so mind you ill tell you something if there is anything still alive itll be furious at all the delay oh
22268,you know i think this must have been a convict ship
22269,first class in hyperspace
22270,i dont know i cant read the script probably just says do not open penalty fifty pounds
22271,cant see
22272,open it
22273,i dont know
22274,i beg your pardon i beg your pardon whats the megara
22275,well its a great relief to know that the law is in such capable hands we have to be going now

22278,im sorry i didnt realise i needed authorisation you see im a stranger here myself but i promise ill never break any other seals without authorisation ever

22288,ahem could we get back to my appeal please  megara 2
22289,ha
22290,i just dont
22291,i dont think i dont think it would do any good theyre justice machines remember i knew a galactic federation once lots of different lifeforms so they appointed a justice machine to administer the law
22292,they found the federation in contempt of court and blew up the entire galaxy  megara 2
22293,hmm
22294,your honours im sure that my witness wishes to withdraw that last remark dont you  megara 2
22295,miss dvoratrelundar when we opened the hyperspace capsules what did we find inside
22296,dead things
22297,and when we found the hyperspace capsule in which their honours were travelling could you see what was inside
22298,what did you think was inside
22299,what even creatures still alive
22300,no further questions  megara 2
22301,your honours i call as my second witness miss vivien fay

22305,trying to find out who she really is
22306,well it might just save my life  megara 2
22307,why else do you think the megara are here
22308,well who else has been around for four thousand years its got to be miss fay
22309,because theyre justices not policemen
22310,yes its a pity theyre also dead

22312,good girl
22313,yes but not for long
22314,i beg your pardon your honours i was consulting with my associate
22315,oh come what does it matter where she goes as we all know no one can escape the megara am i not right your honour  megara 2
22316,what but why the previous witness was attached to the assessor
22317,i demand that this witness be treated in exactly the same way as the previous one  megara 2
22318,i submit most respectfully that your honours are in error  megara 2
22319,but you have ruled that this witness need not be attached to the assessor because she wasnt present when the seals of your capsule were broken
22320,how do you know that
22321,that is not proof
22322,no no i dont say that i say that she will never tell us anything approaching the truth unless she is forced to i dont think that shed even tell us her real name except from fear of the assessor
22323,what does that mean  megara 2
22324,how do you know youve been locked in that capsule for four thousand years even the finest piece of machinery deteriorates after that time rust dust pieces of fluff think how youd feel if you condemn an innocent humanoid to death just because you got a bit of fluff stuck in your sprocket wheel or whatever it is youve got in there
22325,very well if youre so perfect test yourselves i dare you ask her her real name  megara 2
22326,i thought you were on my side
22327,great lawyer youve turned out to be
22328,objection  megara 2
22329,youre wrong your honour theres one other witness i can call
22330,you
22331,why not why not i only want to put my counsel on the stand theres nothing in the law that says i cant do that is there well is there  megara 2
22332,travelling to where
22333,what was the nature of your business
22334,ah a female humanoid criminal
22335,of what crime had the female humanoid been accused
22336,ah and did the great seal of diplos by any chance have any special powers
22337,ha exactly as i thought  megara 2
22338,and her description
22339,you have none how do you expect to identify her then
22340,you do not
22341,but all the officers are dead
22342,then you have no way of knowing who she is
22343,she is cessair of diplos
22344,why else is she here in hyperspace whats the ship doing here  megara 2
22345,do you usually execute your own clients
22346,mmm well it certainly adds a new dimension to the role of defending counsel wait a minute wait a minute arent you supposed to be offering me a last toffee apple or something a blindfold a hearty breakfast a free pardon no
22347,ah goodbye goodbye goodbye      k9
22348,hello did i shortcircuit

22456,well of course not he hasnt arrived yet
22457,well as far as i can without the proper tools

22503,intelligent than the real one well of course he is i programmed him
22504,its funny you know thats what some androids say about people
22505,anyway how can you possibly be frightened of something that goes pfft if it shortcircuits

22523,i do indeed safe conduct for count grendel in return for romana also safe and sound
22524,where is romana you realise of course that count grendel will have to go into exile but theres no reason then why you cant go into exile with him is there wheres romana
22525,you bring her in its a good offer lamia a fair offer
22526,what is it k9

22550,how long do you think the siege will last zadek
22551,two years well we havent got two years before grendel kills both the king and romana anyway looking at that plan id say theres only one way into the castle
22552,if someone on the inside opens the main gate and a group of our men under cover of darkness take the guard by surprise
22553,me
22554,no no one man and his dog come on k9

22582,right
22583,use the tracer
22584,ah
22585,you were very careless i found it when i came in here come on lets go
22586,what sorry to leave tara i didnt even catch one fish not one come on
22587,well he wheres k9
22588,well i told you it was a bit swampy its not the tardis fault anyway these marshes go on for miles a little water doesnt hurt
22589,yes well we wont be here long enough to need k9 come on
22590,yes this must be one of the moons of delta magna
22591,never mind about that just point the tracer and see where we go next
22592,forty two and a half degrees
22593,no
22594,yeah or else the tracers developed a fault
22595,yes why dont you try the higher ground there
22596,romana romana
22597,not quite you shot the wrong mans hat though fancy taking me for rohmdutt
22598,well a sort of survey ive lost my friend
22599,something must have happened to her look at the way those reeds are crushed
22600,swampies are they the local tribes here
22601,listen how do i get in touch with these swampies
22602,no no no no im looking for my friend you see shes important to me
22603,fine shush will there be strawberry jam for tea
22604,you should put up the usual notices trespassers will be shot who is rohmdutt
22605,no im new here
22606,i told you looking for my friend
22607,what classified project
22608,what this a methane catalysing refinery classified
22609,what well of course i know what it is ive seen hundreds of them
22610,you earth colonists are always so insular if youd been to binacaananda youd see one in every town
22611,yes
22612,i have my own transport
22613,will you stop saying that what gives him an insight into my mental processes
22614,thats an air vent
22615,its a funicular gas separator
22616,well it looks to me like a primitive enzyme recycler with an injection circuit feeding the bacterium bioplast i imagine that the raw protein is centrifuged before being freezedried and compressed for packaging i think youd find it more efficient if you inserted a plasmin catalyst ahead of the bioplast circuit
22617,yeah why not
22618,am i free to go now
22619,oh
22620,right a sort of mineralogical survey look ive got to go and find my friend
22621,orbit shot
22622,ah
22623,very sensible
22624,and just the six of you here
22625,oh no i make it six one two three
22626,doesnt he count
22627,ah why are his friends attacking you
22628,in any case a lake that size couldnt possibly support ten full scale refineries
22629,oh then you must have an alternative source of methane feedstock
22630,ah tell me where were your men when they were killed
22631,what oh i dont know just curious
22632,what happened
22633,then they might just have been drowned
22634,well anyone can make a mistake
22635,what teach them to carry trays
22636,well progress is a very flexible word it can mean just about anything you want it to mean
22637,hello
22638,well if youve seen one orbit shot youve seen them all  swampies
22639,are they having a dance
22640,whos kroll
22641,yes but just the same a blood sacrifice i dont like the sound of that
22642,what look i have a shrewd idea who it is that might be being sacrificed and romanas not the easiest of guests
22643,theres no need for you to be involved
22644,well he probably looked more convincing from the front
22645,im not smug
22646,sucker marks
22647,look sucker marks pretty ancient too by the way the erosions
22648,oh theyve told you about their local water deity have they
22649,yeah or to his memory kroll was brought here hundreds of years ago he must be dead by now
22650,dont talk to me about politics
22651,i wonder where they found that look its a genuine antique
22652,are you all right
22653,what
22654,what i picked it up
22655,no no no no it would be extremely foolhardy trying to cross the swamp in the dark would it not
22656,i dont think so theyre more likely to be digging trenches
22657,they expect to be attacked at any moment
22658,yes i followed a swampie carrying vital information
22659,well shush
22660,its a primitive methane catalysing refinery a pilot plant for bigger things they hope
22661,the earth colonists from delta magna theyre the ones who shipped the little green men up here
22662,thats right of course that was all a long time ago
22663,precisely
22664,yes i wouldnt have thought it was worthwhile but theyre producing a hundred tons of compressed protein twice a day
22665,yes theyre sending it back to delta magna in orbit shot capsules
22666,i dont know i havent discovered that yet but theyre producing it and in sufficient quantities to make it worth fighting over
22667,rohmdutt so thawn was right about the guns i wonder
22668,well whos paying rohmdutt i mean they obviously dont use money here
22669,at the bottom of that shaft therell be an underground passage i wonder where it leads to
22670,so do i
22671,i think its an illustrated history of the tribe a sort of bayeux tapestry with footnotes
22672,i think its atrociously writ but the pictures arent bad look that shows them being evicted from delta magna
22673,thats right yes they were given this moon as a sort of reservation look there you are theres kroll in his aquarium what did i tell you sucker marks
22674,hmm let me see and kroll when kroll awakened he saw that the people were fat and indolent and then kroll became angry and he struck them down swallowing into him the symbol of his power and killing all who were in the temple even hajes the priest great was the lamentation of the people but kroll returned to the water and slept
22675,thus was the third manifestation of kroll well hes obviously one of those monsters whos not always about the place
22676,yeah still a dormancy period of that length would indicate a creature of massive size
22677,well does it matter hmm does it really matter you know what i think i think that krolls still around and hes just about due for his fourth manifestation
22678,yeah lets get out of here come on
22679,i told them they had their figures wrong but of course i didnt know about kroll then
22680,the refinery there cant be enough sediment in that place to produce the volume of methane they claim to have found so wheres it coming from
22681,what
22682,yes and thawns men vanished while they were taking methane samples drilling into the sediment
22683,yes right got it the refinerys heat exchangers must have raised the lake temperature by several degrees already
22684,and the noise of their orbit shot is rousing kroll
22685,what
22686,what well youd better introduce me
22687,oh i dont know as a wise and wonderful person who wants to help dont exaggerate
22688,i told you not to exaggerate
22689,ah
22690,no probably the usual things fire water hanging upside down over a pit of vipers
22691,you see the weight of historys against you
22692,i know a rogue when i see a rogue and ive no desire to die in the company of a rogue have you have you any desire to die in the company of a rogue
22693,i know that feeling
22694,sevens my lucky number
22695,wasting his breath
22696,hes not the great one hes the insignificant one if youre going to have someone imitate kroll it ought to be more convincing
22697,what
22698,so krolls on the move ive less time than i thought
22699,i dont remember that last night early samoan influence
22700,well thats understandable at your age still i prefer it to gothic perpendicular
22701,you know that windows quite out of place its not in character at all
22702,well architectures quite a serious subject skart where did that window come from
22703,what that window up there
22704,id have sacked him
22705,the architect
22706,did i tell you about the time i was a child
22707,it was a question about
22708,ah and snaps our spines how ingenious now i know the purpose of the window
22709,what is what
22710,well he didnt do much for you last time did he killing the high priest and swallowing the symbol of power
22711,why dont you just let the whole thing drop ranquin youve made your point
22712,oh youre not leaving arent you going to stay and watch
22713,its even more unpleasant to experience ranquin what was the secret of krolls power
22714,ive read about it somewhere
22715,yes i know kroll has it now but what was it
22716,yes but what was the power
22717,your people were evicted from their homeland ranquin you had no choice
22718,i like to get things straightened out
22719,hes got narrow little eyes you cant hypnotise people with narrow little eyes
22720,yes trying to persuade him to untie us our only chance
22721,i dont know the contraction rates of creeper or the breaking point of bones and ligament
22722,sorry you didnt stay on delta magna now eh who paid you to bring the natives guns
22723,and who do they think brought them
22724,why the sons of earth
22725,no no no no shush why did thawn want to discredit the sons of earth
22726,no no no no thats a very good questions after all none of them can ever have seen the earth
22727,imagination
22728,dont give up dont give up how are you doing rohmdutt
22729,stretchings good for the spine well up to a point
22730,i think were in for a storm
22731,no no no no electrical storms on planetary satellites can be quite spectacular
22732,ha ha just relax your muscles
22733,what we need are hailstones big as bricks
22734,ill try a pitch higher
22735,nellie melbas party piece though she could only do it with wine glasses
22736,come on pull rohmdutt pull weve got to stretch these creepers while theyre still wet come on pull pull another foot come on come on you too romana pull pull pull
22737,patience patience another minute wont hurt
22738,this is no time to start talking about noses
22739,listen if its an anxiety you want look the storm will be easing shortly and the swampies will be coming out from under their umbrellas lets get out of here come on
22740,one slip here and youre up to your neck next bit of firm grounds there well have to jump
22741,well theres no other way of getting across
22742,no here
22743,not much further now
22744,shush were being hunted
22745,freeze dont even move an eyebrow
22746,well i told him not to move it hunts by surface vibrations primarily a vegetarian of course but over the years its learnt that anything that moves is wholesome
22747,come on
22748,hold tight
22749,freeze
22750,yes
22751,yes wasnt it lets get out of here before it changes its mind
22752,it looks like it lets see if there are any survivors shall we shush
22753,what back to the rocket silo if he fires off that orbit shot therell be nothing left of the swampies or kroll come on
22754,thawns using the override firing mechanism there must be some way of disconnecting it
22755,what is it
22756,yes wed better say goodbye now goodbye
22757,get out of here romana just get out
22758,just get out
22759,get out
22760,simple really
22761,what oxygen starvation
22762,blacked out for a few seconds
22763,yeah well i needed the rest did you say minutes come on
22764,what if were caught loitering outside of here theyll put two and two together
22765,well i remembered that i forgot to say goodbye this is romana
22766,well i was closing the blast room door it shouldnt be left open like that
22767,well i maybe your cleaning i dont suppose you do have a cleaning lady here
22768,ah havent you forgotten something
22769,shouldnt you say dont make any sudden moves
22770,i dont think that was necessary
22771,oh look its coming this way
22772,well i dont think its come to shake hands
22773,shush maybe its saving you for pudding
22774,no no no we surrender we surrender
22775,all baloney kroll couldnt tell the difference between you and me and half an acre of dandelion and burdock
22776,oh i dont know ask ranquin hes the kroll expert
22777,hey is that your considered opinion you know something romana i think that if we
22778,romana come back
22779,what doesnt know were here its making some pretty shrewd guesses
22780,fenner fenner can you operate the centrifuge
22781,switch it on come on switch it on
22782,noise fenner noise the kroll hunts by sensing vibrations give it something to think about
22783,shush shush
22784,everything youve got fenner all the noise youve got thats it keep it busy
22785,to test a theory all theories have to be tested sometime and this seems as good as any you stay here in case im wrong
22786,the symbol of krolls power
22787,well ive had a happy life cant complain nearly seven hundred and sixty not a bad age      romana  doctor
22788,well it is a bit difficult to explain
22789,what
22790,oh dont worry about that fenner you wont be needing the firing bay any more no more kroll no more methane no more orbit shots ha ha
22791,ah and with the firing bay already blocked
22792,disconnected in the gantry
22793,what in fifty seconds
22794,forty seconds theres only one thing to do
22795,hold that
22796,hmm
22797,i think so
22798,yes
22799,yes time to say goodbye come on romana lets go
22800,oh yes we have yes listen fenner someone will come here and pick you up stay here for a while lead a natural life you might even get to like it teach varlik and his friends how to do a replacement for kroll maybe
22801,im coming
22802,no no come on you know ive got an unerring sense of direction i have
22803,come on
22804,yes
22805,well it all added up i mean the obvious disguise for the segment was the symbol of power and that wasnt around any more
22806,thats right along with the high priest of course it wasnt so big in those days kroll i mean just an ordinary giant squid hello
22807,no no look
22808,cellular regeneration
22809,there must be hundreds of those around now
22810,no no no no not bits of kroll no theyll just be ordinary giant squids nothing to worry about unless of course youre a high priest therell never be another kroll it was the segment that did it
22811,atrios do you know ive never actually been to atrios
22812,where
22813,yes but were not going to zeos
22814,well why dont you get on with it then
22815,atrios k9 atrios i wonder what the inhabitants are like there      hero
22816,there we should be in parking orbit over atrios lets see where were going shall we
22817,thats odd thats very odd wouldnt you say that was very odd
22818,i wonder what went wrong
22819,zero zero six nine thats exactly what you gave me are you sure
22820,no no no just a minute there may have been a time shift lets take another reading
22821,zero zero eight zero one zero what a lot of zeroes there it is
22822,yes
22823,do you know what i think i think somethings gone wrong something fairly serious
22824,well it could be a coincidence
22825,no nor would i theres only one thing to do
22826,i think ill take us in on manual with circumspection
22827,whats the matter
22828,good heavens you could fry eggs in the street
22829,what
22830,not at all no
22831,i dont know probably someone giving a huge breakfast party think positive why do you always assume the worst
22832,empirical poppycock wheres your joy in life wheres your optimism
22833,oh do shut up k9 listen romana whenever you go into a new situation you must always believe the best until you find out exactly what the situations all about then believe the worst
22834,dont be ridiculous it always is isnt it k9  k9
22835,oh i think i can say why
22836,why why its got to be hasnt it its got to be something to do with the sixth and most important segment of the key to time hmm
22837,a welcoming party do you think k9 k9 what do you make of that  k9
22838,no no no no no no wait well dematerialise at the last moment let whoevers shooting at us think theyve hit us always confuse the enemy
22839,right link that tracer in i want to land as close as possible to the sixth segment the less time we spend on atrios the better
22840,standing by k9 how long to impact  k9
22841,no no dont say it please
22842,dont say another underground passage
22843,yes k9 k9 are you still sulking in there come on out no water or swamps its quite safe
22844,i dont know what did you say  k9
22845,four hundred metres they are taking a pasting if its like this down here imagine what its like on the surface
22846,youre right k9 he hasnt been dead shot poor chap
22847,yeah must have been one of his friends just goes to show you cant trust anyone nowadays
22848,no lets locate the sixth segment and get out of here
22849,locked and lead what does that suggest to you
22850,any sentient life through there k9  k9
22851,what
22852,yes what will you come into my parlour said the spider to the fly
22853,i think we should tread very carefully k9  k9
22854,romana theres a
22855,theres a man standing behind you get your hands up
22856,were travellers we seem to be lost actually hes dead
22857,no yes
22858,ive told you we were trying to avoid the bombardment i thought that door might lead to the way out
22859,what he saved our lives
22860,spies do we look like spies
22861,i though spies looked kind of inconspicuous
22862,i told you were not even armed look nothing just a whistle care for a blow go on
22863,tourism
22864,yes well i run this small agency you see trips to battlefields future and past how civilisations died its very profitable isnt it very profitable romana
22865,looking for a key
22866,beautifully put i thought
22867,im sorry i dont think we can help you
22868,no
22869,no i sincerely hope not but i think weve been here long enough
22870,listen we tell you the truth and you dont believe us you accuse us of crimes we havent committed and now youre going to have us shot i think after a long journey thats a bit too much marshal k9 lights
22871,back to the tardis
22872,yes buried under that rubble
22873,theres always a way out if only we can find it
22874,possibly possibly k9s watching our rear
22875,oh its you
22876,just a minute just a minute why do you want to know
22877,ah oh oh well just before the marshal arrested us i did find somebody and judging from the voice it was certainly a young woman
22878,she was through there
22879,no no no wait a minute wait a minute ill take a look
22880,no no no of course not but were friendly dont worry about that romana
22881,keep an eye out round the corner come here merak
22882,why would the marshal want to get rid of astra
22883,too many coincidences well
22884,of course
22885,yes is there any other reason why the marshal would want to get rid of her
22886,good romana ready
22887,anything
22888,yes  k9
22889,merak merak people arent dissolved by radiation youre a surgeon you should know that if shes not here she must be somewhere else
22890,k9 k9 keep an eye on that wall  k9
22891,what
22892,they could have moved her while we were with the marshal they moved the guards body on the other hand
22893,well on the other hand anythings possible well almost merak a recycling shaft recycling what exactly
22894,oh just general interest come on lets go
22895,well if theres no way out theres only one thing to do
22896,come on
22897,where are we going
22898,thats funny i want to see the marshal come on lets move
22899,listen i dont think weve been properly introduced im the doctor who are you
22900,ah marshal i understand youve got a few problems and i was thinking that if you and i got together we er marshal marshal is he all right
22901,what does he do it often
22902,no wonder things arent going well standing in front of a mirror gimbling and smiling at himself like that is the first sign of megalomania hes not a ventriloquist is he
22903,a ventriloquist a chap who throws his voice you know throws his voice has a dummy operates a dummy a dummy a dummy a dummy of course
22904,friend the last time i came here you wanted to shoot me
22905,ah well fancy you mistaking me for a zeon really marshal
22906,forgotten
22907,we had you mean that we were expected
22908,yes i understand how you feel marshal
22909,i am am i
22910,oh goodo as long as theres no personal risk involved of course
22911,this blessed plot
22912,yes no i prefer the original
22913,yes but listen before i do what happens if i dont
22914,oh well im very grateful for your confidence marshal ill see what i can manage er were not under arrest then
22915,listen i shall need to know the situation the basic situation
22916,me
22917,six ships is that it the mighty battlefleet of atrios
22918,why
22919,yes i think so
22920,peace
22921,tell me marshal if you had this ultimate deterrent what would you do
22922,yes well you have a true military mind marshal
22923,ill tell you what ill do you help me find the s you help me find the princess astra and ill knock you up a deterrent hows that
22924,oh yes i think i can do something for you
22925,oh it will be it will be a sort of parasol affair
22926,well a sort of umbrella forcefield you know that no zeon ship can penetrate
22927,well not quite i mean they cant get in but you cant get out
22928,well i mean
22929,well theres always a snag i mean but ill work on it look ill need k9
22930,yes my computer the one you thought was a weapon
22931,furnace what furnace
22932,scrap where is this furnace where is this furnace        k9
22933,warm for the time of the year its a little trick i picked up from the firewalkers in bali they do it all the time come on old boy
22934,oh thats all right we all make mistakes sometimes dont we k9    k9
22935,i thought you might now listen if were going to set up a oneway forcefield one that keeps the zeons out but allows you to pass through it to attack them were going to have to get to know our enemy so to speak
22936,i was thinking in terms of a psychological barrier its cheap efficient and energy saving and it would stop the zeons wanting to come here introduce an element of iatrophobia
22937,yes but to that id have to meet one you see get to know it brain patterns that sort of thing isnt that right romana
22938,now marshal can you arrange that
22939,look it doesnt have to be anything particularly intelligent any prisoner would do
22940,well if you cant find me a zeon ill have to think of something else
22941,quite quite marshal marshal would you excuse us please
22942,thank you
22943,he did how very considerate of him
22944,what
22945,what a device of some sort something you werent meant to see
22946,a control device
22947,yes and whats behind that mirror hes so fond of looking at
22948,merak i believe were closer to finding princess astra than we realise what worries me is are we supposed to
22949,whos pulling the wool over whos eyes are we supposed to fall for the marshals bluff or is he supposed to fall for our
22950,it wouldnt make any difference even if i told you you couldnt reach her
22951,because i think that astras on zeos
22952,zeos is there all right its just you cant see it
22953,can you see me now
22954,why not
22955,right
22956,because its absorbing the light or energy or else its camouflaged
22957,no no no maybe its large or perhaps its small
22958,how could columbus be so sure
22959,never mind about that
22960,behind that mirror over there theres bound to be another entrance you and romana go over there and see what you can find
22961,here    man
22962,no no no no ive worked it all out  man
22963,it wont work look k9s worked it all out  k9
22964,because you wouldnt have a planet to live on
22965,no no not quite not quite you remember i mentioned a psychological barrier a deterrent that no zeon would cross
22966,no i think i said examine
22967,there are on zeos
22968,i go to zeos pick up a zeon and bring the princess astra back if shes there  astra
22969,yes itll give you time to save your neck
22970,you know k9 ive got a feeling were missing out on something are you listening to me k9  k9
22971,really do you mean because of that
22972,yes yes i hear you who are you
22973,yes
22974,yes
22975,no
22976,i dont know
22977,lost lost
22978,yes
22979,yes
22980,oh you mean the tardis yes yes i expected to find that here correct me if im wrong this is zeos isnt it
22981,and we came up in the transmat shaft and then as they say everything went black
22982,certainly interested in timepieces are you chronostatics horogenesis that sort of thing
22983,oh yes i am im sorry to disillusion you whoever you are and you tried breaking and entry into my tardis didnt you and failed covered with automatic defence mechanisms very clever really
22984,well if you do that youll never get them will you and if you let me go in there theres no guarantee that ill come out is there its bigger that it looks you know i take it you have the sixth segment
22985,hold it there must be some civilised solution to all this without this continued use of brute force
22986,look id really like to help you but ive got a problem you see the thing is the segments are in there and of course i can go in there but i cant bring them out here
22987,well you see ive built a failsafe the segments are in a sort of limbo closet in er in limbo and the only way to get at them you see is with the next piece so if youll just let me have it ill pop in there and fetch them for you
22988,no and i certainly dont trust you bit of an impasse eh
22989,thats right fools rush in
22990,no i think ill have a little look round first for the sixth segment
22991,romana merak k9
22992,im not armed you know
22993,well through the transmat i imagine
22994,yes
22995,shapp were on zeos
22996,yes you were transmatted up the transmatter there look transmat
22997,shapp old chap were on zeos listen no bombardment
22998,all right if were on atrios wheres the destruction look not a crack everything perfect
22999,on zeos where the zeons come from but there dont seem to be many of them about which is quite good for us
23000,there must be some evidence this way anyway its time i found the other two
23001,yes
23002,maybe the zeons dont use it much
23003,how do you know
23004,yes except k9 here
23005,no but before the war
23006,what do they look like
23007,theyre not tall emaciated creatures in long black robes
23008,no
23009,why well the ones who brought me here were very sinister
23010,yes but theres no sign of your attacks getting through though is there
23011,isnt it odd youve never taken any prisoners
23012,yes i  k9
23013,good  k9
23014,yes  k9
23015,well id say its been in touch with the sixth segment wouldnt you
23016,i dont know ive never seen him do that before that doesnt mean to say of course it isnt normal  k9
23017,insects with stings in their tails    k9
23018,its fully automated there are no zeons on zeos
23019,no just this passionless lump of minerals and circuitry highly efficient doing very well giving atrios a battering killed millions without a flicker just doing its job and totally invincible
23020,its all right merak be quiet k9 would you ask your friend here  k9
23021,we have a problem well several problems mentalis knows but wont tell about astra refuses us access to the memory banks but tells us that the marshals on his way here to blow this place to smithereens
23022,unfortunately its been programmed that the war is over so it cant attack it thinks its won thats the trouble with machines
23023,well it will selfdestruct i think obliteration was the term it used
23024,there will be a rather large bang big enough to blow up zeos take atrios with it and make certain the whole thing ends in a sort of draw thats the way these military minds work the armageddon factor
23025,has it ever occurred to you shapp that you and the marshal and this thing are in an arena playing out a game for some evil alien spectator
23026,yes i think ive met him calls himself the shadow
23027,well were going to try and neutralise and dismantle mentalis here and its absolutely essential that while im fiddling it doesnt have to be distracted by an attack from the marshal now listen i want you two to go back to atrios via the transmat you shapp are to contact the marshal tell him hes won tell him the wars over tell him anything you like but stop him taking any further action
23028,well then mentalis
23029,then mentalis will
23030,well then mentalis will go into its armageddon sequence well be bits of dust flying round the cosmos including the marshal you might even tell him that what are you waiting for
23031,k9 are you sure this is all right  k9
23032,yes
23033,oh more than likely yeah
23034,more than likely the question is where
23035,romana thats brilliant of course hes got a third planet all to himself
23036,after ive stopped this
23037,what
23038,i dont know k9 what have i done  k9
23039,lets hope shapp reaches the marshal before he does anything silly were very vulnerable till thats done
23040,whats that k9 well  k9
23041,yes and us with it unless
23042,that was close
23043,they werent aiming at me they were aiming at that the control centre like a scorpion stinging itself to death as soon as it sensed i was trying to interfere with the sequence it destroyed its own control centre its mindless now clicking toward oblivion how long k9  k9
23044,here take a look at this
23045,have you got the tracer
23046,lock it in lock it
23047,well it was just an idea i thought if we had fivesixths of the pieces it might give us some power obviously guardian technology doesnt work that way
23048,yeah or a sixth piece
23049,what do you see there
23050,exactly a gap the shape of the sixth piece
23051,we know what it looks like we can make one
23052,here we are
23053,chronodyne
23054,well its as compatible as anything weve got  k9
23055,lock it lock it
23056,have we              doctor
23057,ive stopped the universe still theyll never notice just imagine somewhere someones just slipped on a banana skin and hell be wondering forever when hes going to hit the ground
23058,oh come on romana i mean if it affected the operators no one would be able to use it even the guardians would think of that
23059,yes yes its quite a feeling isnt it gods for an hour or two  k9
23060,probability then  k9
23061,yes how do you set about localising a time loop
23062,eh
23063,oh yes yeah stand aside i hey id better get this right  k9
23064,and the zeon computer room let it be done i thought i handled that rather well
23065,oh come on its only a three second time loop  k9
23066,yes nothing lasts forever
23067,come on quickly remember that time loops stretching
23068,was she now how do you do im delighted to see you im the doctor this is romana
23069,so you rescued her from the zeons
23070,how did you manage that
23071,very likely very likely where are they now
23072,good good
23073,yes look astra why dont you and merak go back to atrios via the transmat hell show you the way
23074,well i dare say but weve got a few complicated things to do and merak does need attention i think the thing you should do is go back and show your people that youre free
23075,of course im right off you go now hope to see you soon
23076,odd
23077,i think we should concentrate on the shadow and the third planet
23078,yes something must have happened  astra
23079,yes what is it what is it quick into the tardis key
23080,all right all right
23081,good
23082,yes that gives us about an hour of real time
23083,its a pretty little thing isnt it
23084,its the key to time are you all right astra
23085,well now youve seen it does it trigger off any hidden memories
23086,thats a pity i was hoping youd be able to tell us where the sixth piece is
23087,yes look we have the other five segments now were looking for the sixth and final one think astra think
23088,good good set the coordinates lets get on our way
23089,well here we are weve tracked him to his lair
23090,all we have to do is find the sixth piece and stop the shadow taking those other five
23091,diagonal thinking thats whats required isnt it astra
23092,astra we need you to help us to find the shadow
23093,no no astra no youre the only one whos ever been to the third planet before come on
23094,yes yes everythings perfectly all right everythings wonderful isnt it astra
23095,go on ill catch you up
23096,intergalactic computer distress signal how very odd how strange here k9        k9
23097,two six zero  ah
23098,ah i see what youre at splitting us up divide and conquer is that it you didnt really imagine we were taken in by astra did you    doctor
23099,no no no no
23100,what
23101,drax
23102,not
23103,drax
23104,yes gallifrey of course ha ha drax
23105,yeah
23106,what happened to you
23107,yeah what sort of things
23108,armaments
23109,drax i was introduced to a computer on zeos called itself mentalis did you by any chance have anything to do with the installation
23110,the shadow
23111,yes very tricky
23112,did you make that
23113,you made this here
23114,drax i dont want to pry but where did you acquire this peculiar vocabulary
23115,brixton
23116,ive been to earth
23117,no no its very colourful very demotic
23118,doctor
23119,no offence
23120,drax
23121,drax
23122,that hole in the wall
23123,might that might it lead to a way out
23124,find what
23125,yes but where does it lead
23126,arent they stabiliser components
23127,but you said your tardis was parked on zeos
23128,how long have you been here
23129,five years for five years youve had a dimensional stabiliser virtually intact and you havent managed to escape
23130,oh come on drax you could have repaired that and longdogged it out of here years ago
23131,arent you
23132,yes you would whats he offered you
23133,are you about to suggest that you and i make a run for it out of here in my tardis
23134,oh yes its a very good idea you and me in my tardis and what happens then when were inside eh sock full of sand lead pipe and you away with the key to time am i right drax
23135,if you had do you think hed let you get away youd be in for the chop too
23136,of course you would so why dont you help me i mean together we stand a slight chance and after all we are time lords you and i class of ninety two if we dont stick together who will
23137,try synaptic adhesion
23138,i think its synaptic adhesion
23139,all right got to be synaptic adhesion all right all right ill leave it to you shall i
23140,drax where does this lead
23141,yeah yeah of course
23142,i refuse to negotiate in an atmosphere of threat
23143,well of course it matters you have the sixth piece i take it
23144,well id like to see it if its possible
23145,ah yes if i bring the other five pieces
23146,what is it you have in mind i mean what do you intend to do
23147,yes i suppose you realise ive rigged things so that atrios and zeos are protected
23148,yes my puny well it may be puny but it works if you break that millions of people will die
23149,our
23150,oh
23151,very well
23152,i suppose you realise that once i give the shadow the key to time that you and your colleagues will be superfluous
23153,no drax no no  drax fires his dimensional stabiliser or whatever it is and the doctor fades away
23154,you shrank the wrong man drax
23155,why didnt you shrink the mute the tardis doors open
23156,like putty
23157,yes the doors open so the shadow can go in there and take the key to time romana cant help and the time loop must be at breaking point by now
23158,yes you might say that and of course theres the marshal
23159,no
23160,hes in the time loop as well making a rocket attack on zeos unless of course shapp and merak get in contact with him
23161,back on atrios i hope
23162,oh
23163,mobility
23164,yes if the shadow gets the five pieces from the tardis which he undoubtedly will its up to us to get the sixth piece
23165,the shadow said id already seen it it must be astra
23166,she must have it lets see where this crack leads shall we
23167,what you mean theres a way in he doesnt know about
23168,no no no no but if we get k9 up there we wont need a pick and shovel will we we can still give the shadow a surprise
23169,no no drax no small is lovely
23170,everything all right k9  k9
23171,blaster working k9  k9
23172,id sit somewhere else if i were you ready k9  k9
23173,the stabiliser drax now
23174,quick back to the tardis quick
23175,come on romana merak get inside
23176,quick get inside man
23177,what
23178,no romana come on
23179,romana it wasnt our idea to use the royal house of atrios as carriers was it
23180,i dont like it any more than you do but its done have you set those coordinates yet
23181,well you could start by setting the coordinates for zeos
23182,romana you get carried away if you dont set those coordinates millions of people will die and this time it really will be our fault have you forgotten the time loop
23183,in less than a second
23184,listen drax drax dont just stand there what colour
23185,what
23186,drax
23187,drax
23188,drax
23189,drax you took your time wheres k9
23190,really how is he
23191,yes
23192,i dont think so
23193,what the marshal
23194,quick
23195,well i cant help what he was aiming at
23196,a mere nothing a mere deflective forcefield set up for a millisecond set up between the marshal and zeos bounced the missiles smack onto the planet of evil
23197,yes
23198,well im sorry about that i dont know what im apologising for i just saved your lives can i drop you somewhere drax
23199,contract job no armaments i hope
23200,when did you arrange this
23201,i see fiftyfifty
23202,ah
23203,ill let you know bye bye drax
23204,bye bye drax
23205,why gallifrey
23206,we have the power to do anything we like absolute power over every particle in the universe everything that has ever existed or ever will exist as from this moment are you listening to me romana
23207,because if youre not listening i can make you listen because i can do anything
23208,well of course im all right but supposing i wasnt all right this thing makes me feel in such a way id be very worried if i felt like that about someone else feeling like this about that do you understand
23209,what do you understand
23210,oh thank you sir thank you  guardian
23211,whats the president got to do with it  guardian
23212,ah oh i have i have indeed sir do you like it  guardian
23213,what happens now sir you said if i remember in our first conversation that once it was assembled it would stop the entire universe and enable you to restore the natural balances of good and evil throughout the whole of the universe  guardian
23214,look
23215,i think not remember the key to time is still mine rage all you like  guardian
23216,when i give the signal
23217,dematerialise
23218,hmm
23219,key to time oh well i just scattered it round through space and time
23220,going i dont know
23221,what
23222,exactly
23223,well if i knew where i was going thered be a chance the black guardian would too
23224,hence this new device
23225,well its called a randomiser and its fitted to the guidance system and operates under a very complex scientific principle called pot luck
23226,what a brain oh ho what a brain
23227,romana the dogs got laryngitis
23228,regenerating what are you talking about regenerating only time lords regenerate look its awfully nice to see you princess astra
23229,romana ah  k9
23230,but you cant wear that body
23231,but you cant go round wearing copies of bodies
23232,no
23233,well then go and try another one go on
23234,whats the trouble here preoccupation with external appearances
23235,well lengthen it then go on trying to look like other people
23236,exactly good heavens thats exactly right ha i never realised you had such a sense of style
23237,ah but its nice to get them right though isnt it
23238,exactly
23239,no no no the arms are just fine theyre just fine its just that oh well all right have it your own way but get rid of those silly clothes eh
23240,i dont know it depends on the randomiser
23241,weve arrived  romana
23242,oh thats fine thats fine here take a couple of those will you
23243,antiradiation pills the levels are quite high out here heres a bleeper thatll bleep when you need the next dose
23244,oh look rocks
23245,good got to do something with k9
23246,when replacing a brain always make sure the arrow a is pointing to the front did you get that arrow
23247,absolutely right
23248,i dont know a feeling ive been here before
23249,oui
23250,nothing tangible i just have a sensation a pervading air of can you feel it too
23251,what and never know where ive been until the end of time i wouldnt sleep at night come on
23252,very precious in a geological sense more precious than diamonds but id need a bigger bit ah ha ha ha i was right
23253,well then see what you make of it
23254,limestone and clay making
23255,add gravel
23256,you know something youve got all the makings of a first class navvy concrete manufactured
23257,yes
23258,lets go this way
23259,dont know something fairly serious by the look of it
23260,i dont know underworld dentist come on
23261,well you try digging a hole through rock
23262,what the living dead you mean a planet ruled by zombies i want to know who lives on this planet with one basic difference the living are very much like the dead who was it said the living are just the dead on holiday never mind you should meet one you can always tell a genuine zombie
23263,skin is cold to the touch i want to get a closer look at that body
23264,listen sorry did i startle you
23265,the deceased was a combat pilot serving with the third galactic fleet of the planet kantra
23266,yes
23267,whats very odd he died of exhaustion and malnutrition
23268,except wouldnt you have expected him to have died of radiation first
23269,well its not a flying saucer
23270,well without reference to my janes spacecraft of the universe i wouldnt dispute that
23271,yeah interesting technique camouflage and defence
23272,yeah probably hit it at the beginning of the tourist season how far away would you say that was
23273,well thats just about the distance for a good bracing walk
23274,yeah well it would be less than gracious not to welcome them we can pretend were couriers come on  a hatch opens in the remaining visible part of the spacecraft as the doctor and romana make their way towards it then something goes bang in the sand nearby and another and another they run away back to the ruins
23275,i dont know got it underground drilling
23276,high impact phason drills
23277,yes someones imported some high technology
23278,cant a fellow get any sleep around here
23279,i dont know i cant see all of me my extremities seem unimpaired but im being squashed can you take some of the weight
23280,were not going to move this without help k9 could do it if he was in one piece ive got my
23281,good
23282,who knows
23283,id rather hoped youd resist the temptation to say that dont forget the arrow  romana
23284,must remember to give romana hers
23285,i must say how grateful i am to you charming people i repeat how grateful i am to you charming people you lifted that column off me as though it were a matchstick i cant think for the life of me where you keep your muscles
23286,oh i see yes part of their training is it well excuse me
23287,no no i had a little trouble with my directional equipment
23288,yes well something of the sort
23289,no
23290,well thats not much help see im terribly oldfashioned i prefer names
23291,skaro
23292,what are you doing here
23293,no i dont understand why are you here on skaro
23294,commander you must tell me what youre doing here on skaro its vital
23295,well ill tell you when you tell me what youre doing here
23296,yes thank you thank you i know
23297,oh better than you could possibly imagine
23298,im very familiar with their methods its vital i know what theyre doing here
23299,but commander what
23300,tyssan tyssan what are the daleks mining for tyssan tyssan what are the daleks mining for come on
23301,yes
23302,good man good man yes why didnt you speak to me
23303,was she hurt
23304,good good
23305,what
23306,come over here tyssan its vital i get into dalek control can you show me a way
23307,never mind can you do it

23318,that looks interesting
23319,yes never mind about that this is the first underground level where we are now
23320,i have an uneasy feeling i know now thats odd theres no plan of the fourth level
23321,yes yes theres a shaft leading directly from the surface to the fourth level which the daleks cant possibly know about otherwise they would have come from the surface to the fourth level and burrowed to the third i wonder        dalek 6

23376,yes you hadnt foreseen that one had you
23377,good good now ill need one minute to get clear get back i told you this was life insurance ive adapted the device to explode by remote control
23378,just so long as youve got it clear
23379,dont you be so sure
23380,oh a kaled mutant of course the daleks were originally organic lifeforms i think youve just told me what the daleks want with davros havent you
23381,tyssan
23382,yes so ive seen
23383,oh it was nothing nothing where are they now
23384,that could be very useful tyssan

23399,are you feeling all right
23400,good were going to play a game now
23401,paper wraps stone
23402,scissors cuts paper ha ha but suppose we were two computers controlling two great battle fleets each one working perfectly logically to outmanoeuvre the other well youre robots you try it
23403,try it go on
23404,you play with me eh come on
23405,scissors cuts paper
23406,paper wraps stone
23407,stone blunts scissors again scissors cuts paper
23408,paper wraps stone
23409,stone blunts scissors
23410,yes
23411,i will
23412,no youve overlooked something suppose i was willing to help you to change the balance of power which im not davros will be doing exactly the same things for the daleks i mean he may be mad but his computer skills are almost as great as mine
23413,how
23414,when i give the signal move
23415,jelly baby
23416,doctor catches robot
23417,dont you ever speak to me like that again you understand never
23418,jelly baby you keep out of this its a personal matter isnt it
23419,so just mind your own business
23420,and you mind your own business too
23421,duck
23422,yes well not quite theyre just power packs with some main circuits
23423,yes thats it tyssan tyssan well done tyssan any news of davros
23424,the daleks will be sending a ship for him we mustnt let him get away
23425,one two three four five ill go alone ask me why
23426,theyre unconscious also im a very dangerous fellow when i dont know what im doing you stay here tyssan youll need this ship to get home romana you help him    doctor
23427,hello i didnt think getting to see you would have been so easy are you just going to sit there quietly and wait for the dalek ship to pick you up
23428,well its nice to be wanted isnt it
23429,oh
23430,oh yes two vast computers so evenly matched they cant outthink one another
23431,yes
23432,oh of course
23433,oh no
23434,would you have told the daleks
23435,but you failed the prisoners set me free
23436,really and how will you stop me activating that control before they reach their target
23437,really
23438,oh im sure theyll welcome me with open arms i mean they would welcome me with open arms if they had arms please please no offence meant at all
23439,bye bye
23440,what
23441,all elephants are pink nellie is an elephant therefore nellie is pink logical
23442,you know what a human would say to that
23443,thats why the daleks came back for you they remembered they were once organic creatures themselves capable of irrational intuitive thought and they wanted you to give it back to them to get them out of their trap of logic
23444,yes what does it feel like
23445,no but i think this little device can its a cryogenic freezer even you cant escape from a solid block of ice bye bye davros
23446,that was a narrow escape come on weve got some digging to do
23447,of course i could its obvious
23448,yes both sides were fighting with computers perfectly logically each computer could predict the move of the other and counter it result stalemate
23449,wins the battle yes make mistakes and confuse the enemy
23450,yes
23451,yes what
23452,mistakes me well perhaps once a century or so    doctor
23453,nice isnt it
23454,marvellous absolutely
23455,well i think its marvellous
23456,really how did i describe it
23457,its the only place in the world where one can relax entirely
23458,what paris has it has an ethos a life it has
23459,a spirit all of its own like a wine it has
23460,it has a bouquet yes like a good wine you have to choose one of the vintage years of course
23461,ah well yes its 1979 actually more of a table wine shall we say ha the randomisers a useful device but it lacks true discrimination should we sip it and see
23462,lets not be ostentatious
23463,that would look silly well take the lift come on
23464,are you talking philosophically or geographically
23465,then were going to lunch i know a little place that does a wonderful bouillabaisse do you like bouillabaisse
23466,hmm

23478,well he threw it down there lets have a look
23479,i dont know its as if time jumped a groove for a second
23480,for a portrait of a time lady thats not at all a bad likeness
23481,yes isnt it
23482,ha almost like a crack in time a crack in time
23483,i think theres a matter with time didnt you feel anything
23484,yes it must be because ive crossed the time fields so often no one there seemed to notice anything you and i exist in a special relationship to time you know perpetual outsiders
23485,hmm what do you make of that then
23486,what computer pictures you sit in paris and talk of computer pictures listen ill take you somewhere and show you some real paintings painted by real people
23487,never mind about the time slip were on holiday come on
23488,what oh no no no
23489,oh no no
23490,no no no no no no this is the gallery the only gallery in the known universe which a picture like
23491,quite good thats one of the great treasures of the universe and you say quite good
23492,what are you talking about
23493,i dont care its one of the great treasures of the universe
23494,i dont care let them gawp let them gape what do i care

23499,well of course i noticed
23500,look in your pocket other pocket
23501,the woman i bumped into was wearing it
23502,look at it
23503,thats right she was using it to get a complete report on all the alarm systems around the mona lisa
23504,it is very a pretty painting
23505,that thats never the product of earths civilisation
23506,it is a very pretty painting romana
23507,you know i think something very funny is going on you remember that man who was following us
23508,well hes standing behind me poking a gun in my back
23509,patron three glasses of water make them doubles         scarlioni
23510,what bracelet

23515,i dont know if you noticed but he was pointing a gun at me anyone in my employ who behaved like that id sack him on the spot
23516,youre english arent you
23517,patron i thought i ordered three glasses of water
23518,doctor
23519,scarlionis angle never heard of it have you ever heard of scarlionis angle
23520,whos scarlioni
23521,what
23522,ah well weve only just landed on earth
23523,crazy enough to want to steal the mona lisa
23524,all fakes of course
23525,really what and the only connection in this is the count
23526,so
23527,he isnt clean any more the countess has the bracelet
23528,well it depends on what you want to do with it uh oh
23529,i think were being invited to leave
23530,i say what a wonderful butler hes so violent hello im called the doctor thats romana thats duggan you must be the countess scarlioni and this is clearly a delightful louis quinze chair may i sit in it i say havent they worn well thank you hermann thatll be all
23531,well im a very pleasant fellow
23532,yes i could see that the moment you didnt invite me to have a drink well i will have a drink now you come to mention it yes do come in everybody
23533,ah well its my job you see im a thief and this is romana shes my accomplice and this is duggan hes the detective whos been kind enough to catch me thats his job you see our two lines of work dovetail beautifully
23534,yes
23535,ah well youre a beautiful woman probably and duggan was trying to summon up the courage to ask you out to dinner werent you duggan
23536,who sent me what
23537,what
23538,hello there
23539,well i just thought it was awfully pretty and a terribly unusual design of course it would have been much nicer to have stolen one of the pictures but ive tried that before and all sorts of alarms go off which disturbs the concentration
23540,yes well i think it is dont you
23541,oh
23542,good well well be off a quick stagger up the champs elysees perhaps a bite at maxims what do you think romana
23543,ah duggan what are you doing for heavens sake thats a louis quinze
23544,just behave like a civilised guest i do beg your pardon count
23545,now hermann if youd just be kind enough to show us to our cellar wed be terribly grateful do come along my good chap
23546,how longs the chateau been here hermann
23547,really that long restored four or five hundred years ago
23548,very stimulating very stimulating and this would be the cellar would it
23549,really good lord a laboratory are you locking us into a laboratory
23550,oh id much rather stay out here this looks so interesting
23551,what happens after that
23552,shush light the lamp
23553,then get it right
23554,exactly exactly whats the point of coming all the way here just to escape immediately what we do is we stay here
23555,let them think theyve got us safe
23556,then we escape light the lamp come on
23557,its not working
23558,dont
23559,it was useful against the daleks on skaro
23560,oh you wouldnt remember never mind
23561,its working would you like to stay on as my scientific advisor
23562,yes
23563,yes i suppose so why
23564,thats fascinating shall we look at the lab first
23565,no there are bound to be a couple of guards at the top of the stairs
23566,i want to look at the lab first
23567,in the last few hours ive been thumped threatened abducted and imprisoned ive found a piece of equipment which is not of earth technology and ive been through two time slips i think this lab might have something to do with it
23568,what about it
23569,yes
23570,theyre not going to steal it at five oclock in the afternoon are they
23571,because the louvre is still open
23572,now while were here why dont you and i find out how theyre going to steal it and why or are you just in it for the thumping
23573,i know but mainly for the thumping what do you think romanas up to
23574,nor do i looks intriguing dont you think
23575,what
23576,me
23577,me im the doctor what youre doing is terribly interesting but youve got it wrong
23578,well youre tinkering with time thats always a bad idea unless you know what youre doing
23579,the whole world
23580,well thats a very small place when you consider the size of the universe
23581,oh some can and if you cant you shouldnt tinker with time
23582,itll be the end of you if youre not careful never mind the cow look
23583,a few technical problems no no no the whole principle youre working on is wrong you can stretch time backwards or forwards within that bubble but you cant break into it or out of it its true you have created a different time continuum but its totally incompatible with ours
23584,have you tried this
23585,what do you mean what did i do i just reversed the polarity this is very expensive equipment isnt it
23586,well youd whats your name
23587,kerensky
23588,theodore nikolai kerensky a scientists job is to ask questions you should
23589,yes thats your philosophy isnt it if it moves hit it hes going to be all right if you do that one more time duggan im going to take very very severe measures
23590,im going to ask you not to  romana
23591,about what
23592,lets look
23593,yes four to five hundred years
23594,no no no in my view a room thats been bricked up for four or five hundred years is urgently overdue for an airing
23595,duggan
23596,he seems to be financing some dangerous experiment with time the professor of course thinks hes breeding chickens
23597,i think im going to need some machinery
23598,eh
23599,i dont know
23600,its the mona lisa
23601,i dont know whats hanging in the louvre but this is the genuine article
23602,the brushworks leonardos
23603,its as characteristic as a signature the pigment too
23604,every one what i dont understand is why a man whos got six mona lisas wants to go to all the trouble of stealing a seventh
23605,i wouldnt make a very good criminal would i
23606,can i ask you where you got these
23607,right or how you knew they were here
23608,theyve been bricked up a long time
23609,i like concise answers
23610,oh
23611,oh
23612,no
23613,duggan duggan why is it that every time i start to talk to someone you knock him unconscious
23614,well if you dont understand heads you shouldnt go about hitting them
23615,duggan your job is to stop his men from stealing the mona lisa the other mona lisa
23616,i should think so too that was a ming vase second dynasty absolutely priceless
23617,no you have romana you look after him ive got to go meet an italian middleaged italian in fact late middleaged renaissance come on
23618,me
23619,ah well i just dropped by to see leonardo actually is he about
23620,really
23621,captain tancredi
23622,no
23623,well ill want to question him so we can both have a little chat cant we
23624,you what are you doing here
23625,well i do flit about a bit you know
23626,yes i suppose so
23627,i dont know i dont seem to be able to help myself there i am just walking along minding my own business and pop im on a different planet or even a different time but enough of my problems what are you doing here
23628,well i mean if youre the last of them there cant be that many about to save can there jagaroth
23629,jagaroth i think it was on one of my trips yes you all destroyed yourself in some massive war wait when
23630,is it really how time passes so what are you doing here
23631,yes well four hundred million years ago it would have been a bit of a shambles no life to tidy it up no life
23632,well as i was saying
23633,what box
23634,that box i dont know ive never seen that box in my life ah
23635,oh thank you
23636,how can i talk if you confiscate my
23637,yes
23638,well jagaroth spaceships isnt it isnt it
23639,yes well i mean quite honestly when you think about all that jagaroth spaceship
23640,the borgias yes yes i see your point
23641,yes as i said i see your point
23642,i know its just his hands are cold
23643,all this is totally unnecessary
23644,ive changed my mind if theres one thing i cant stand its being tortured by someone with cold hands what is it you want to know
23645,its simple im a time lord
23646,well
23647,what do you mean times running out its only 1505
23648,are you all right
23649,righto
23650,is he often like this
23651,the centuries that divide me shall be undone i dont like the sound of that
23652,well what news
23653,what
23654,two people one was a pretty girl and a young man fair hair he was always hitting shush were they here
23655,shush no time ive got the human race to think about shush the human race
23656,patron you remember those two people i was in here with yesterday we kept being held up and attacked smashing things you dont happen to know where they went do you no they cant have been mad enough to go back to the chateau
23657,id like to make an appointment with count scarlioni at his earliest convenience if you dont mind that is
23658,what its been missing for centuries
23659,i know i recognise the handwriting
23660,no mine hed sprained his wrist writing sonnets wonderful stuff to be or not to be thats the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and take arms against a sea of troubles thats a mixed i told him that was a mixed metaphor and he would insist
23661,only nornorwest nobodys perfect if you think im mad because i say i met shakespeare where do you think your precious count got that
23662,contacts human contacts how much do you really know about him eh i think rather less than you imagine
23663,how long have you been married to the count
23664,long enough i like that discretion and charm so civilised so terribly unhelpful
23665,there is such a thing as discretion theres also such a thing as wilful blindness
23666,yes you see the count as a master criminal an art dealer an insanely wealthy man and youd like to see yourself as his consort but whats he doing in the cellar
23667,man are you sure of that a man with one eye and green skin eh ransacking the art treasures of history to help him make a machine to reunite him with his people the jagaroth and you didnt notice anything how discreet how charming
23668,think about it countess think about it
23669,indeed indeed yes i so much prefer the weather in the early part of the sixteenth century dont you wheres duggan
23670,ah there you are duggan are you behaving yourself good good now count this is what ive come to say if youre thinking of going back in time youd better forget it
23671,well because im going to stop you
23672,i am
23673,count that sort of blackmail wont work because i know what the consequences will be if you get what you wanted i cant let you fool about with time
23674,ah well im a professional i know what im doing i also know what youre doing romana put the equipment down
23675,count do you realise what will happen if you try to go back to the time before history began
23676,shush
23677,theyre not nice to know
23678,yes without the stabiliser he only had the time bubble
23679,what he was really trying to do was to put the whole world in the bubble like those tiny jumps in time when we first arrived
23680,cracks in time he shifted the whole world back in time for two seconds but what he really wanted to do was shift the whole world back in time four hundred million years
23681,what do you think weve been chasing about for all this time
23682,yes he couldnt have sold them anyway
23683,well before leonardo painted them i wrote these are fakes on the blank board with felt tip it would show up under any xray
23684,no because you supplied him with the vital component he needed
23685,one minute would be sufficient for him to go back in time contact his ship and prevent it exploding he wouldnt then be splintered in time and all history would be changed
23686,ive got an idea
23687,well ask duggan
23688,very pretty
23689,how very fulfilling for you
23690,what were going on a journey
23691,just dont ask come on
23692,the jagaroth will leave a faint trace through time but we can only follow it if we get to the tardis in minutes come on
23693,is no one interested in history
23694,this will be the middle of the atlantic ocean
23695,duggan we are where i promised wed be four hundred million years back in earth history
23696,yes
23697,hell be here ah theres the jagaroth ship the last of the jagaroth a vicious callous warlike race the universe wont miss them
23698,the amniotic fluid from which all life on earth will spring where the amino acids fuse to form minute cells cells which eventually evolve into vegetable and animal life you duggan
23699,yes well not that soup exactly its inert theres no life in it yet its waiting on a massive dose of radiation
23700,yes the explosion that caused scarlioni to splinter in time also caused the birth of the human race and thats whats about to happen the birth of life itself
23701,no no if we were watching wed be in dead trouble weve got to stop scaroth
23702,yes thats his real name if we dont stop him the entire human race will cease to exist instantly

23705,no scaroth you cant
23706,no scaroth no youve pressed it once youve thrown the dice once you dont get a second throw
23707,no the explosion that you in there are about to trigger off will give birth to the human race the moment your race kills itself another is born that has happened it will happen
23708,no the product of your destruction history cannot change it cannot

23921,no i was too busy being frightened and alarmed
23922,lets find out shall we
23923,oh please you put that very crudely
23924,i was just saying lady adrasta that k9 i thought you were meant to be guarding her  k9
23925,no
23926,organon goodbye old man so sorry about this thanks for all the help
23927,if my deductions are correct the wellbeing of two planets is at stake erato must not die
23928,no wait thats all youve got on this planet isnt it weeds weeds forest and weeds you scratch about for food wherever you can but you cant plough the land can you you cant do anything until youve mastered the forests and the weeds and you cant do that without metal
23929,do that and you will hurl this planet back into the dark ages and for what to satisfy the petty power cravings of that pathetic woman
23930,have a care yourself care for your people for a change
23931,now if my deductions are correct
23932,erato came here fifteen years ago to propose a trading agreement tythonus is a planet rich in metallic ores and minerals am i not right k9  k9
23933,the tythonions exist on ingesting chlorophyll large quantities of it judging by their size now theres a superabundance of planet life on chloris so
23934,right but who was the first person he met
23935,right and did she put the welfare of her struggling people above her own petty power no shes tipped the ambassador into a pit and threw astrologers at him
23936,lets see if erato agrees with me shall we
23937,well its very simple why dont you come over here take hold of the communicator and well hear the truth from your larynx
23938,come on just take hold of the communicator
23939,shes dead
23940,erato
23941,my pleasure
23942,yes yes of course huntsman see to it it is a bit claustrophobic down here
23943,dont say that
23944,i dont know just dont say it not yet
23945,i did i did and i discovered youre going to die of indigestion    k9
23946,well yes then we should know the truth
23947,well only as much as he wants us to know until hes set free
23948,why not
23949,he has no intention of crushing people
23950,nonsense he just wanted to talk
23951,yes talk talk after adrasta stole his communicator he was just trying any way he could to make contact
23952,yes we do in an egg
23953,in an egg when the shells complete its a blindingly simple space vehicle complete with photon drive
23954,well of course hes not going to leave it lying round where just anyone could take it he protected it very carefully
23955,it was concealed in the pieces he kept hidden in the pit
23956,yes
23957,yes
23958,yes
23959,yes
23960,yes
23961,yes
23962,yes
23963,yes
23964,yes after hes told us whatever it is
23965,and before he reaches his space vehicle to escape
23966,do remind me to give him back his photon drive
23967,exactly once he guarantees chloris safety well let him have it back and then negotiate a proper trading agreement
23968,yes
23969,well
23970,where is it
23971,yes im ready to speak to it i just hope im ready to hear what it has to say to me
23972,organon take this and guard it with your life i dont want to take it anywhere near erato until i want to give it to him all right
23973,romana take the communicator right erato lets hear what youve got to tell us
23974,oh do get on with it
23975,shush romana the communicator
23976,yes but now ive set you free you can contact them all and call it off yes
23977,oh please no more astrological mumbojumbo
23978,a neutron star
23979,i know what a neutron star is
23980,bad chloris sun will explode and your whole solar system will be destroyed is that bad
23981,shush
23982,ahem but your machine is in pieces
23983,how long
23984,how long
23985,one hour seven seconds and you spin out this vessel from the threads in your own body like you did in the pit
23986,and can you produce aluminium
23987,erato a thin shell of aluminium wrapped around a neutron star will minimise its gravitational pull and we can yank it back out of the suns field
23988,well the tardis we can exert short bursts of enormous gravitational pull on the star slow it up while you weave your eggshell round it and then let go
23989,right
23990,erato you came here for your own good and offered the deal to the wrong person will you now condemn an entire planet of innocent people to death
23991,i know im right well
23992,good now this is what
23993,oh well its a hypothetical question my dear old thing
23994,well i took the precaution of removing your photon drive be a good girl romana
23995,im so sorry to butt in and at such a delicate moment but if youre seriously thinking of taking over chloris i think theres something you should know in a very few hours all thatll be left of it will be a few trillion tons of deepfried rubble now does that influence your thinking
23996,wait im talking about a shell fragment if erato doesnt get his ship launched within the hour chloris sun will explode how does that appeal still want to be scrap iron merchants
23997,really look
23998,for what for this heap of scrap iron
23999,are you willing to sacrifice your life and the lives of everyone on this planet for wealth
24000,i thought youd say that k9  k9
24001,k9  k9
24002,have we picked up the neutron star yet
24003,good
24004,i dont want to hear them
24005,dematerialise now
24006,you in position erato
24007,gravity tractor beam activate
24008,deactivate tractor beam
24009,yes erato
24010,hold tight everybody
24011,how much longer erato
24012,good
24013,the control circuit i cant turn off the beam
24014,were pulling the star towards us
24015,erato we did it
24016,what seventy four million three hundred and eighty four thousand three hundred and thirty eight well thats extraordinary
24017,well thats my lucky number
24018,handsome yes yes i know organon
24019,are you in charge here now
24020,good good well weve just dropped in to say goodbye and to give you this its from erato
24021,hmm
24022,bit of a mishmash
24023,well one of the ships must have been in dematerialised form when it happened nasty could cause terrible problems  k9
24024,interfere of course we should interfere always do what youre best at thats what i say now come on
24025,i dont know
24026,at our own pace
24027,gentlemen gentlemen please id say it was knock for knock wouldnt you
24028,no no we answered your mayday im from galactic insurance and salvage been having a look around this is my assistant romana im the doctor how do you do
24029,oh k9 well a computer of sorts
24030,no but he has been know to bite arent we going to introduce ourselves
24031,we just met
24032,how do you do
24033,yes
24034,what about a better idea why dont we try to separate the ships
24035,i like doing the impossible
24036,oh youve spoilt it now
24037,therefore if we can recreate identical circumstances the ships could be separated
24038,then full reverse
24039,i preferred it when it seemed impossible
24040,are you pressing the right button
24041,can we switch on the wreck of the power unit
24042,all right all right wheres the power unit
24043,good no romana you stay here i might need you ill take k9 k9 k9  k9
24044,hold on i thought the idea was youd show me
24045,how very odd  k9
24046,yes
24047,yes ill tell you something about your man secker
24048,he ran away
24049,yes perhaps hes unwell can i have a look at your log and check to see if hes been to any planet where he might have picked up vraxoin
24050,what about one of the passengers one of them could have been the carrier so to speak
24051,anyone else
24052,tryst
24053,where had he been
24054,yes but id still like to know where hes been
24055,me
24056,well i told you im from galactic
24057,i wondered why i hadnt been paid
24058,thats what i thought where can i find tryst
24059,good good look you try and find secker and meet me in the first class lounge and
24060,no no do you want this ship repaired or not
24061,well then just find secker and meet me in the lounge in five minutes
24062,what
24063,i do
24064,no no no thats perfectly all right im just interested in the voyage its fascinating
24065,the volante
24066,and you invented this marvellous machine to collect your specimens you know i knew a man once who toyed with an idea like this what was his name professor stein
24067,yes
24068,yes well by reputation he once gave a seminar on the
24069,of course youre extremely anxious to be on your way
24070,no
24071,could you take me to the power unit yourself
24072,good good tryst thank you very much for your story very interesting we must have a chat about this machine of yours sometime
24073,and about the notion of your capturing alien species for your own private zoo
24074,yes
24075,by putting them in this machine
24076,ah yes of course just in the same way a jam maker conserves raspberries
24077,no k9 checked all the planets hed been to  k9
24078,absolutely sure
24079,fascinating the two ships are rejecting each other molecularly speaking that is
24080,exactly exactly is there another way to the power unit
24081,that wont be necessary ive got my own equipment
24082,wheres the power unit
24083,i dont know
24084,k9 see if you can find anything in there  k9
24085,hello no wait please
24086,i bushwhacked
24087,bushwhacked  k9
24088,yes someone aboard this ship is smuggling drugs vraxoin
24089,yes
24090,yes
24091,thats right they incinerated an entire planet someones found another source
24092,what the lift
24093,what about it
24094,oh no the animals themselves are converted into magnetic signals and their habitats
24095,yes the cet machines just an electric zoo for cages read laser crystals either way the animals are trapped inside
24096,what do you mean
24097,what
24098,thats a pity he might have been able to say what attacked him
24099,right first things first romana you take care of the cet machine
24100,oh im sure k9 will be careful wont you k9  k9
24101,hes not just a mobile blowtorch you know hes saved my life on lots of occasions beat me at chess once shush
24102,i dont know
24103,nothings inexplicable
24104,its inexplicable wed better put it back
24105,maybe but secker was a dead man already
24106,he was taking vraxoin
24107,dymonds ship
24108,yes the vraxoin must be found
24109,bad stuff its the worst ive seen whole planets ravaged by it while the merchants made fortunes
24110,what my people
24111,no im the doctor i keep telling you that
24112,work for i dont work for anybody im just having fun
24113,can you check the whole ship with this
24114,secker kept his in the luggage area i took what was left then someone took it from me after stunning me that is
24115,yes who indeed
24116,is there any possible shield against that scan
24117,really
24118,yes a small thick tube very mysterious
24119,yes i know i know weve got to get the ships separated
24120,yes you know there might be a way we can do it using my ship
24121,yes
24122,oh around
24123,yes or i you captain
24124,yes but whos helping whom
24125,right when i give the word i want dymond to put his ship on full power trust me captain
24126,i want to get as close as possible  k9
24127,are you sure about that that creature came through the picture
24128,you were right about this machine it is unstable and that creatures escaped from its electric zoo i wonder where it came from
24129,eden
24130,well it rings a bell
24131,im absolutely amazed
24132,no i mean im amazed at you tryst using a machine like this when its still so primitive the whole things utterly unstable
24133,good good i value my life and this machine makes me fear for it
24134,yes
24135,well at a rough guess id say the spatial integrator transmutation oscillator hologistic retention circuit shall i go on
24136,dimensional osmosis damper
24137,you mean you havent even got a dimensional osmosis damper professor you dont realise how unstable this machine is
24138,well im delighted to hear it
24139,good
24140,what
24141,im on my way romana off to the tardis ill give you details later tryst dont you forget to switch that off
24142,stay there k9 stay there right then dymond ready for another try i want you to put your ship on full power not now when i tell you  dymond
24143,here if its all right with you romanas in my ship i can keep an eye on things from here
24144,thank you romana  romana
24145,romana get ready what did you say romana get ready    dymond
24146,im looking for a man dressed just like you
24147,which way did he go this way  man 2
24148,i just want to talk to you i promise you youll enjoy it stop
24149,what are you doing
24150,romana stop do you know ive just come through an interface thats no mean feat im not even sure im all here
24151,yes i have i have did you see anyone while i was in there coveralls dark glasses
24152,it must have been the chap i was chasing the fellow who jumped me in the luggage section still i know something about him now he dropped his radiation band in the struggle just now look volante
24153,yes
24154,rigg said tryst and della were the only ones from the expedition to come aboard
24155,well we have to ask rigg
24156,what
24157,well that doesnt sound like drunkenness to me
24158,well inside the projection set its the only place romana weve got no choice
24159,what we have to do weve got to get inside that machine come on
24160,oh really
24161,you can
24162,romana please
24163,you are
24164,yes
24165,what
24166,well maybe its because shes innocent howd you know she did it
24167,thank you tryst
24168,good good now listen
24169,can i just tell you something please
24170,on this ship
24171,neither have i
24172,drugs vraxoin
24173,will you please listen someone aboard this ship is smuggling drugs
24174,well how would i know i dont even know who he is yet
24175,oh well im called the doctor date of birth difficult to remember sometime quite soon i think
24176,would you please listen vraxoin is the biggest killer drug in existence and its on this ship
24177,theres no good time the criminals must be caught
24178,youre wasting your time
24179,oh for heavens sake fisk
24180,all right can i just say one thing at this moment
24181,its simply that look
24182,get me eden
24183,test an old theory of mine come on
24184,come on romana we must we must
24185,weve got no alternative come on come on
24186,might give us a few answer though
24187,lets go east
24188,well i dont well go that way and well call it east
24189,all right well call it north
24190,can we go please
24191,the same way i knew we could get into the tardis tryst doesnt realise what hes stumbled on at least i dont think he has
24192,yes all this is recorded on laser crystal when its played back
24193,yes well roughly speaking
24194,yes
24195,yes
24196,idiots theyre worse than idiots theyre bureaucrats they just exist to tangle people up wrap them round and round in red tape until they cant move romana
24197,i cant move
24198,yes it eats people
24199,quick over there the root
24200,root root
24201,yes
24202,you know that didnt taste at all bad
24203,shush its waiting for us to make any kind of sound
24204,i dont know hello there thank you very much were terribly grateful to you for saving our lives
24205,stott stott of the tryst expedition
24206,yours i believe im the doctor this is romana were travellers and
24207,not bad not bad at all how long have you been here
24208,well stott youve got some explaining to do a hundred and eighty three days here
24209,yes yes quite tell me when did you first discover you could get out of the projection
24210,really
24211,why didnt you tell tryst and della youd got out
24212,really
24213,ah ha you thought it was me didnt you
24214,yeah youve got the stuff i had
24215,yes but more important is where the main supply is hidden and where it comes from
24216,then weve got to get the dimension projection sealed off again which means doing what we first came to do
24217,separate the ships tell me if we go out of the projection in that direction do we come to the power unit
24218,good good then thats what well do come on well come on      k9
24219,its all right hes mine
24220,its just a perfectly ordinary electric dog  k9
24221,of course i do i can start anything from a steam engine to a tardis have you got a match
24222,i want to jam this switch down
24223,perfect  k9
24224,youd better guard the door k9 how many were there  k9
24225,no no no until the ships are separated and the projection is stabilised itd be like trying to bail out a small boat with a
24226,yes
24227,is that the one romana romana was that
24228,k9
24229,ive got to get this finished romana did you check the cable to the reactor
24230,well check it i need to be absolutely sure
24231,was it the one
24232,its a good thing you checked i could have caused a spectacular explosion
24233,nearly two things one i need to know whether the power on the bridge is on maximum two the demat has to be switched on from the tardis at exactly the same time i switch on this old gas oven all right
24234,good
24235,stott i want you and romana to go back through the jungle k9 i want you to go back the way you came  k9
24236,no no im going to rig myself a little time device could i borrow your watch please
24237,good is that on ships time right now ill give you till 20
24238,ill have to use my wits off you go take care look out for excisemen i dont think they like us very much off you go then
24239,plenty of time  the doctor bends down for a piece of equipment just as the mandrel takes a swipe at him
24240,no no
24241,twenty twentyone ill never do it
24242,how very odd how very strange
24243,hello k9
24244,hello romana everything all right
24245,i got caught in the interface when the two ships separated hello della
24246,bit uncivil of them pointing their guns at us like that
24247,yes tell me what would you use an inchuka laser for
24248,shush could it carry a cet projection crystal
24249,because dymonds got a cet projection machine aboard the hecate with an inchuka laser attached
24250,it looks like it the only way of convincing fisk is to catch them in the act of transferring the vraxoin  k9
24251,never mind about us we know who the smugglers are
24252,dymonds the pickup man and the smugglers tryst himself
24253,yes the vraxoins kept on the eden crystal theyre about to transfer that crystal to the hecate
24254,yes one of them attacked me in the power unit poor thing was electrocuted burnt to a powder
24255,vraxoin
24256,yes they can make the transference across space by means of the inchuka laser
24257,yes
24258,i let them do it
24259,youre arresting the wrong man you know fisk
24260,romana what happened
24261,the callous wretches theyll be making the transfer to the hecate by now    fisk
24262,gentlemen once more into the
24263,they wont go anywhere without the eden crystal that gives us a little time
24264,well now that the ships are separated we can at last stabilise the cet properly
24265,yes
24266,it means fisk that we can finally clear this marauding menagerie back into the projection which is exactly where dymond will want it
24267,give him what he wants we have to bait the hook properly dont we
24268,im going inside now and i may be rather a long time
24269,quick switch it off
24270,romana youve got two minutes fifty eight seconds to rebuild this machine
24271,yes
24272,yes
24273,do i look as if im joking well
24274,five points thats not enough were going to need some more power from somewhere
24275,good
24276,i want to increase the range and power of this machine how many points now romana
24277,ten and building thats much better were going to be all right
24278,yes yes it was just a little shock thats all
24279,shush quiet quiet reverse the setting on the transmutation reflex its all right its all right its quite safe
24280,so
24281,will you please reverse the setting on the transmutation reflex
24282,forty seven point three vector seven niner niner i hope youre right k9
24283,have you ever heard the expression hoist by his own petard
24284,good well what
24285,on the contrary fisk ive already caught them there they are all yours
24286,go away
24287,go away
24288,the nightmares here on the eden crystal
24289,i think the best way of conserving the poor creatures trapped in these crystals is to project them back to their own planets dont you
24290,the mandrels have a perfect right to exist in one way tryst was right humans do have some kind of choice lets just hope that no one else discovers the secret
24291,there that should immobilise her for the moment  k9
24292,what do you mean he could be right how could he possibly be right hes only a dog you know
24293,we do seem to be moving
24294,yes but everythings off except whats on of course
24295,well ive just been trying out a little idea i had for a slight modification of the conceptual geometer
24296,so what
24297,no i dont what could possibly go
24298,there are no planets in the sector
24299,romana do you think id dismantle half the control systems including the conceptual geometer the dematerialisation circuits
24300,the dematerialisation circuits do you think id do that if there was the slightest risk of our being brought into a gravitational field
24301,its all right its all right its all right stay calm watch
24302,romana were moving very fast
24303,no its not pulling hard enough for that anyway theres nothing charted
24304,fascinating isnt it i wonder what it would be like to be crushed to a singularity
24305,hmm what
24306,oh right right k9 well put it together again i need your help k9
24307,yes of course i can fix anything given time
24308,what
24309,how interesting ha looks like a spaceship
24310,yes  k9
24311,well were jammed up against that spaceship pretty battered old ship been here for years centuries probably i think well go and take a look
24312,no ah heres a notion the defence shield on the doors on a different circuit it might be possible to extrude it
24313,watch
24314,it was nothing nothing k9  k9
24315,lets go
24316,yes i do believe it is
24317,what  k9
24318,oh yes no one in his right mind would mix hymetusite and passengers
24319,hmm doors locked
24320,well im the doctor this is romana who are you
24321,aneth thats a charming place
24322,yes but not yet
24323,nowhere
24324,skonnos
24325,what
24326,no thats all right i heard what you said i was just thinking what a curious thing to be
24327,what
24328,yeah well here as you so rightly say we are huh
24329,another things been drawn into the ship
24330,yes sargasso sea in space romana
24331,suppose just suppose someone were beginning to create a black hole
24332,artificially i mean
24333,oh yes fix gravity beam attract matter to one point in space and when theres enough it starts to collapse to a singularity but whod want to do that
24334,id say it was increasing
24335,unless we find a way of getting out of here were all going to be crushed to a singularity
24336,oh never mind about that seth whos in charge of this ship
24337,ah pleased to see you
24338,sacrifices
24339,no
24340,well thats a good question er can you get us out of here
24341,i might be able to why dont you put that thing away and show me your controls
24342,arent you going to put that thing away
24343,well all right if thats the way you want to play it    doctor
24344,hello whos that
24345,ah
24346,what
24347,but the ship hasnt crashed
24348,i dont like the sound of that
24349,these engines have seen better days
24350,well the sooner the better its a right hodgepodge up there very old engines patched up with new equipment a lot of it not really compatible
24351,yes
24352,the odd thing is the new equipment seems to be the product of an entirely different technology
24353,have to noticed how peoples intellectual curiosity declines sharply the moment they start waving guns about
24354,yes oh yes i can make it work the question is can we generate power soon enough to take the ship to escape velocity before we fall into a black hole with an event horizon
24355,shush you just hold the gun steady dont tax your mind
24356,not with that fuel
24357,brilliant i wish id thought of that
24358,ha ha take a look
24359,all right what do you think romana
24360,yeah well listen as soon as he brings the hymetusite
24361,good girl romana now listen im popping back to the tardis to get some gear here take this you might need it
24362,oh really really you made this not bad bit basic though huh thank you
24363,yes oh ha ha so sorry
24364,k9  k9
24365,were almost there get back to the flight deck and switch on the engines
24366,then you wait until i come and give you the signal to start building up power hurry and dont forget to wait for the signal
24367,right now as soon as he switches on the power you know what to do
24368,good girl
24369,im going to move the tardis into the hold of this ship then we can ride out with it park somewhere and repair it with as much time as we like
24370,well it would be if the dimensional stabiliser was working its all right its all right k9 said its just fused
24371,ow  k9
24372,the copilot
24373,poor romana  k9
24374,k9 k9 are you all right k9  k9
24375,right k9 without our gravitic anomoliser this is the best we can do lets give it a try shall we ah come on old girl
24376,right here we go again after five four three two one  come on
24377,there we are hello that looks interesting reminds me of something yes i think well take a look in there to start with  k9
24378,oh no not again how is it wherever i go in the universe there are always people like you pointing guns or phasers or blasters now dont do anything hasty its just a flying visit take me to your leader
24379,ah hello im the doctor
24380,yes i just dropped in
24381,mmm you must be soldeed
24382,i thought so
24383,thank you i say that looks interesting very interesting
24384,neutrino converter
24385,oh ive seen similar things here and there
24386,how very odd how very extraordinary then you dont know what a neutrino conversion is did you know that someones building a black hole on your doorstep
24387,yes i got stuck in it along with one of your spacecraft
24388,yes yes a good thing i got stuck in it too otherwise your ship would still have been there
24389,yes well with a little help from my friend nice girl i dont suppose youve seen her have you blonde about so big always sticking her nose in things that dont concern her
24390,i just thought she was heading this way
24391,oh no idea what im talking about how do you explain that soldeed
24392,its my gravitic anomoliser from my tardis  now wheres romana
24393,unaccustomed as i am to public speaking id like to say one thing and let me make it perfectly clear i stand before you desperate to find the exit can anybody help me    skonnos complex entrance
24394,hello is this a private party
24395,hello what are you doing skulking down here
24396,oh yes of course yes
24397,oh i dont know you call this a maze its a cheat
24398,well the walls keep changing
24399,just a minute i saw this place from above just before i landed it reminded me of something
24400,i cant think what
24401,no no no hell be too busy repairing his furnace
24402,no no he has another use for those altogether
24403,yes
24404,looked like a nuclear reactor to me
24405,yes your tribute had a very practical purpose i think theres something horribly evil going on here lets go shall we where are the others well
24406,what come on come on
24407,why not
24408,thats right
24409,well of course not whatever gave you that idea
24410,that i was trying to find a way out oh no weve got to go deeper into the complex
24411,right come on this way
24412,just as i thought
24413,it certainly is what do you make of it
24414,yes of course with the horns on the top as the antennae
24415,energy
24416,yes but for what purpose
24417,yes i think its about time someone else found out
24418,tell me and then run in that order
24419,got it
24420,now i know what this place reminded me of when i saw it from the tardis
24421,a giant positronic circuit
24422,and the reason why the walls keep changing is when the circuits in operation
24423,exactly
24424,need a computer to find that out
24425,got it k9
24426,certainly certainly well i should think so i mean he could follow our psychospores couldnt he      skonnos complex entrance
24427,no i thought for a moment it was a giant transmat
24428,thats right its a direction beam of some kind though
24429,yes wait a minute thats some kind of bearing of course its focused on the black hole
24430,well we said it was artificially created
24431,yes
24432,it could be a gateway towards hyperspace
24433,yes
24434,i dont know but ill tell you something interesting when i mentioned the black hole to soldeed he didnt seem to know what i was talking about
24435,exactly if soldeed doesnt know about the black hole what does he think all this if for
24436,that was quick good old k9
24437,quick come on hide hide
24438,i want to find out what hes doing
24439,i dont know what hes doing whatever it is hes doing i think were too late to stop him doing it
24440,what
24441,yes
24442,it wouldnt need engines would it romana
24443,two black holes one at the beginning of the journey one at the end and a hyperspatial tunnel in between
24444,yes
24445,thats right
24446,so did soldeed theyve been terribly clever fiendishly clever
24447,invasion
24448,yes it happens all the time when a race runs out of space or destroys its home it has to find somewhere else to live
24449,yes
24450,yes
24451,well
24452,millions
24453,well as more arrive theyll build more transmats and increase exponentially you dont imagine this is the only planet thats been tricked do you weve got to stop them
24454,seth and teka
24455,right
24456,i want to know everything about that capsule
24457,everything
24458,its all right
24459,i think ive found the main power control
24460,yes if i can reverse the flow the energy will go back to where the spacetime tunnel begins
24461,yes i might even be able to send the nimons back again
24462,there that should do it
24463,i said that should do it
24464,she must have been inside the capsule
24465,well ill have to switch the whole thing back lets hope weve got time
24466,its all right i can explain everything
24467,no well you see what happens is
24468,seth well done
24469,no just knocked out right now lets see what the damage is oh i dont like the look of that sorry romana
24470,its very bad i might just be able to fix it if i can cannibalise one of the other circuits
24471,no no youve done enough its k9 i need now
24472,it might help you see its an entirely different system but it just might be compatible
24473,well if its compatible itll work better than the original on the other hand if its not compatible
24474,therell be a bang so big you wont even hear it
24475,hell warn the nimon quick after him
24476,ah
24477,welcome back romana
24478,ah hello there i was just
24479,well really i was just standing admiring the view  nimon 2
24480,thank you seth
24481,ill do better than that ill lock it off for good romana
24482,i think were going to be all right
24483,k9  k9
24484,what do you mean what is it its my dog
24485,hes called k9 k9 i want to modify the controls i want to divert the spacetime tunnel and send the nimons back into the middle of nowhere what do you think    k9
24486,well if the nimons got her shell be in the larder
24487,ill meet you both there go on off you go
24488,k9 this is going to be a bit sticky
24489,no theyre not theyre just paralysed k9 get them out quickly  k9
24490,well youre not saved yet come on lets get out of here before the whole place explodes come on
24491,ah but they didnt have a brilliant tracker dog like k9 did they he can follow the scent all the way to the exit come on k9 come on
24492,what is it k9  k9
24493,what but it cant be try pointing the staff
24494,in the name of the second skonnon empire
24495,k9 what do you make of that wall in front of you  k9
24496,shush just a minute k9 is that a wall in front of us  k9
24497,everybody take cover the whole place is about to explode
24498,yes well what could possibly go wrong out here
24499,ive said it hundreds of times before
24500,oh four or three
24501,oh not much better nasty race of people still theyre too busy fending for themselves to bother anyone else now
24502,hmm
24503,crinoth
24504,good job too
24505,i should hope so i made sorak give them a ship
24506,poor old seth
24507,yes well just imagine the legends tekas going to build up around him hell have to spend the rest of his life trying to live up to them its terrible
24508,yes im glad this time i reminded them to paint their ship white the last time anything like this happened i completely forgot caused quite a hooha
24509,hmm oh other times other places well come on old girl theres quite few millennia left in you yet
24510,not you the tardis  ltback to the episode listing
24511,wordsworth rutherford christopher smart andrew marvel judge jefferies owen chadwick
24512,owen chadwick oh yes some of the greatest labourers in the history of earth have thought here
24513,oh definitely newton
24514,thats right
24515,oh yes there was no limit to isaacs genius
24516,restful
24517,its october
24518,i did may weeks in june
24519,so was the tardis
24520,yes well at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can go wrong no coordinates no dimensional stabilisers nothing just the water a punt a strong pair of hands and the pole
24521,er i think its about time that we go and see if the professor is back in his room ask me how
24522,for every reaction there is an opposite and equally different action
24523,what            doctor
24524,do you know i think youre very probably right you should have been an historian
24525,good afternoon wilkin   targetblank gerald campion
24526,wilkin you remembered me
24527,yes but how kind of you to remember me
24528,and you do it splendidly now
24529,oh good good good wilkin how did you know i wanted to speak to professor chronotis
24530,did i really i was here in 1958
24531,yes but in a different body
24532,nice to meet you wilkin bye bye  come on
24533,come in over there hell ask us if we want tea  chronotis
24534,you too professor this is romana
24535,have you really
24536,well i wouldnt have said no
24537,oh sometimes
24538,what can you do for me you mean what can i do for you you sent for me

24552,professor you said you brought it back by accident
24553,you thought that perhaps id take it straight back to gallifrey for you
24554,professor i dont want to be critical but i will its very risky bringing books back from gallifrey
24555,i mean they could be so dangerous in the wrong hands hmm
24556,on some nights new york was as hot as bangkok  ive read that
24557,once upon a time read that and ah ah ha and in the ancient days of rassilon five great principles were laid down can you remember what they were my children
24558,i know it is its very good
24559,yes it is good
24560,professor professor how many books did you bring back for heavens sake
24561,dangerous
24562,the worshipful and ancient law of gallifrey
24563,professor how did that book get out of the panopticon archives
24564,took it
24565,and were they
24566,excuse me delicate matter professor slightly
24567,its one of the artefacts
24568,professor you know that perfectly well rassilon had powers and secrets that even we dont fully understand youve no idea what might have been hidden in that book

24580,what cant read
24581,it did that
24582,hello im the doctor and you
24583,clare clare keightley can i have a look at your xray machine
24584,well the book must have stored up vast amounts of subatomic energy and suddenly it released it when the machine was activated  does anything strike you about that
24585,its a very strange way for a book to behave
24586,never underestimate the obvious
24587,nothing obviously
24588,so obviously it was meant to tell us nothing exactly the opposite function of a book therefore
24589,what was that
24590,look at that
24591,not only is this book not a book but time is running backwards for it i think id better return it as soon as possible dont you
24592,yes
24593,well im the doctor and you cant have it
24594,yes itll be taken to a place of safety
24595,oh a little place i have in mind
24596,im not mad about your tailor
24597,yes
24598,coming
24599,who are you
24600,never heard of you youre the one causing all the trouble
24601,wheres the professor
24602,he just what
24603,where was the body
24604,here
24605,its gone he must have been on his very last regeneration did you say someone had stolen his mind
24606,thats funny skagra threatened to do that to me too
24607,you know the name
24608,what
24609,shada
24610,shada no you
24611,well mister skagra or whatever it is you call yourself youve killed a time lord and a very old friend of mine its time you and i had a little chat k9  k9
24612,come on you too bristol
24613,there it is
24614,neither did i
24615,thats what i said watch that cow pat
24616,ow dont move
24617,shush k9 whats it powered by  k9
24618,how large  k9
24619,got to be an entrance whats that carpet doing here    k9
24620,k9 any sign of that deranged billiard ball  k9
24621,romana id feel much happier if you three waited outside no point in all of us walking into the spiders web
24622,i wonder if
24623,where have you taken them
24624,skagra what have you done with the professors mind
24625,it was serving a perfectly useful purpose where it was
24626,you realise he died
24627,you take a very proprietorial attitude to other peoples brains
24628,just exactly who are you skagra
24629,then you may as well tell me
24630,which book this book
24631,oh i have a very monotonous reading voice really by the time id got to the bottom of the first page youd be asleep and  id escape and then where would you be
24632,i presume you cant read gallifreyan then
24633,all right are you standing comfortably
24634,then ill sit down
24635,im paraphrasing of course
24636,shush shush shush youll like this bit this is a good bit  skagra do you realise  this book doesnt make one bit of sense
24637,skagra this thing is written in code how am i doing
24638,who me
24639,oh no no no im afraid im very stupid very stupid im very very stupid
24640,theres no point in giving me orders im very stupid
24641,it wasnt
24642,ah how stupid of me
24643,ah well i dont know about that i dont know about anything in fact im really an appallingly stupid creature
24644,very stupid ha very stupid
24645,whos that
24646,no whos speaking
24647,the ship a talking ship
24648,skagra must be hard up for friends will you tell me where my companions are
24649,oh i dont mean any harm
24650,im sorry
24651,i am
24652,oh well it wasnt was it the trick on those occasions is not to resist i just let the thing believe i was stupid so  it didnt pull nearly hard enough it got a copy of my mind but left me with the original intact understand
24653,no more do i perhaps i really am stupid no got it i know im dead
24654,ah well it must be true then will you tell me where my companions are now
24655,an enemy me not true if im dead then im an exenemy of skagra correct
24656,and a dead man can hardly be a threat to anyone correct
24657,then if i am dead i cant possibly give orders that would be any kind of threat to skagra
24658,then will you please arrange the release of my companions
24659,but im ordering you to and as we have established the fact that i am dead that im incapable of ordering  anything that would threaten skagra so if i were to order you to release them it cant threaten him will you release them now
24660,excellent thank you its getting stuffy in here
24661,yes i thought wed sorted that out
24662,what argh
24663,no im not im dead
24664,ive been nearly too clever by three quarters
24665,i persuaded the ship that i was dead and it cut off my oxygen supply
24666,it wont take orders from an enemy of skagra but since it believes im dead since i am dead the ship  has no reason not to accept my orders
24667,it only resumed the oxygen supply when you came in youre still alive officially
24668,wheres romana
24669,skagra he must suffer k9 is the tardis still where we left her outside  k9
24670,or when
24671,time machine
24672,so can he hes got a copy of my mind in that sphere of his everything i know is at his disposal
24673,well probably wants someone to show off too
24674,what
24675,shush shush shush shush im dead remember
24676,its only programmed to obey instructions not to think about them blind logic it serves skagra and doesnt think beyond that
24677,ship speaking to you as the late lamented enemy of your lord skagra i command you to tell me where he has gone
24678,thats it ow ouch
24679,square one thats where weve got to go if we want to find out what skagras up to  once we know that we know where to find him ship i order you to take us to where your lord skagra last came  before arriving here
24680,ship how long will the journey take
24681,what thats neary three months
24682,yes incredibly slow stop
24683,i said stop halt
24684,ship im now going to introduce you to a few new concepts now listen very carefully  reverse the polarity of your main drive feed right
24685,regrade your deossilation diagetic synthesisers by ten points
24686,did i say ten points sorry minus ten points
24687,realign your maxivectal meter on drag so they crossconnect with your radial bicentric arrows
24688,good now this is the easy bit
24689,ive constructed a primitive dimensional stabiliser by remote control the journey will now only take  a couple of minutes to anywhere
24690,oh well lets not harp on that aspect too much shall we
24691,oh come on ship whats taking you so long
24692,hurry up

24789,a great criminal unique mental powers he had the ability to project his mind into other minds completely take them over didnt he professor
24790,oh no no no no no quite the opposite skagra had the capacity to take minds out of people but he cant put minds back into them thats why he needs salyavin in the sphere and thats why hes going to shada
24791,with skagras mind and salyavins in the sphere skagra will be omnipotent
24792,yes eventually it might take thousands of years but that wouldnt matter his minds immortal it would spread like a disease
24793,skagras mind not a pleasant thought
24794,yes but how hes got a start on us and we dont know where it is
24795,you followed the tardis spacetime track of course of course lets go
24796,good good now you two
24797,stay here
24798,shush i am not at liberty to explain k9 you can come along but no tangling with any krargs unless of course if you have to tangle with any krargs

24807,shush shush quiet im thinking
24808,never mind about that just believe me all the minds that skagras stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own and operating as one and with the professors i mean with salyavins mind in there too they can now control anyone they can control everyone theyll be invincible

24829,good good good
24830,hello old girl howve you been keeping sorry i had to barge in through your back door like that  but if you had any idea what its like to travel through the spacetime vortex ha ha of course you do  silly me you do it all the time but at least youre built for it now lets see whats happening outside shall we
24831,hello
24832,what do you mean how did i get in there its mine i belong in there
24833,well skagra thats a very interesting theory  lets try putting it to the test shall we

24841,take them back to dear old shada
24842,let the time lords sort it out im not going to play judge and jury it was only forgotten about because the professor  made us forget he didnt want his escape to be discovered that must be why he stole the book when he left gallifrey
24843,well well find out

24914,of course it is its one of the artefacts
24915,yes yes each of the artefacts was imbued with stupendous power the meaning of most of them has been lost by now but the powers remain and the rituals
24916,what words
24917,yes pompous lot all words and no actions
24918,salyavin
24919,oh yes salyavin he was a boyhood hero of mine

24923,he was imprisoned before i was born
24924,on do you know i cant remember professor  chronotis
24925,ive only just asked you

24948,well the book must have stored up vast amounts of subatomic energy and suddenly it released it when the machine was activated  does anything strike you about that
24949,its a very strange way for a book to behave
24950,never underestimate the obvious
24951,nothing obviously
24952,so obviously it was meant to tell us nothing exactly the opposite function of a book therefore
24953,what was that
24954,look at that
24955,not only is this book not a book but time is running backwards for it i think id better return it as soon as possible dont you
24956,yes
24957,well im the doctor and you cant have it
24958,yes itll be taken to a place of safety
24959,oh a little place i have in mind

24976,come on you too bristol
24977,there it is
24978,neither did i
24979,thats what i said watch that cow pat
24980,ow dont move
24981,shush k9 whats it powered by  k9
24982,how large  k9
24983,got to be an entrance whats that carpet doing here    k9
24984,k9 any sign of that deranged billiard ball  k9
24985,romana id feel much happier if you three waited outside no point in all of us walking into the spiders web
24986,i wonder if
24987,where have you taken them
24988,skagra what have you done with the professors mind
24989,it was serving a perfectly useful purpose where it was
24990,you realise he died
24991,you take a very proprietorial attitude to other peoples brains
24992,just exactly who are you skagra
24993,then you may as well tell me
24994,which book this book
24995,oh i have a very monotonous reading voice really by the time id got to the bottom of the first page youd be asleep and  id escape and then where would you be
24996,i presume you cant read gallifreyan then
24997,all right are you standing comfortably
24998,then ill sit down
24999,im paraphrasing of course
25000,shush shush shush youll like this bit this is a good bit  skagra do you realise  this book doesnt make one bit of sense
25001,skagra this thing is written in code how am i doing
25002,who me
25003,oh no no no im afraid im very stupid very stupid im very very stupid
25004,theres no point in giving me orders im very stupid
25005,it wasnt
25006,ah how stupid of me
25007,ah well i dont know about that i dont know about anything in fact im really an appallingly stupid creature
25008,very stupid ha very stupid
25009,whos that
25010,no whos speaking
25011,the ship a talking ship
25012,skagra must be hard up for friends will you tell me where my companions are
25013,oh i dont mean any harm
25014,im sorry
25015,i am
25016,oh well it wasnt was it the trick on those occasions is not to resist i just let the thing believe i was stupid so  it didnt pull nearly hard enough it got a copy of my mind but left me with the original intact understand
25017,no more do i perhaps i really am stupid no got it i know im dead
25018,ah well it must be true then will you tell me where my companions are now
25019,an enemy me not true if im dead then im an exenemy of skagra correct
25020,and a dead man can hardly be a threat to anyone correct
25021,then if i am dead i cant possibly give orders that would be any kind of threat to skagra
25022,then will you please arrange the release of my companions
25023,but im ordering you to and as we have established the fact that i am dead that im incapable of ordering  anything that would threaten skagra so if i were to order you to release them it cant threaten him will you release them now
25024,excellent thank you its getting stuffy in here
25025,yes i thought wed sorted that out
25026,what argh
25027,no im not im dead
25028,ive been nearly too clever by three quarters
25029,i persuaded the ship that i was dead and it cut off my oxygen supply
25030,it wont take orders from an enemy of skagra but since it believes im dead since i am dead the ship  has no reason not to accept my orders
25031,it only resumed the oxygen supply when you came in youre still alive officially
25032,wheres romana
25033,skagra he must suffer k9 is the tardis still where we left her outside  k9
25034,or when
25035,time machine
25036,so can he hes got a copy of my mind in that sphere of his everything i know is at his disposal
25037,well probably wants someone to show off too
25038,what
25039,shush shush shush shush im dead remember
25040,its only programmed to obey instructions not to think about them blind logic it serves skagra and doesnt think beyond that
25041,ship speaking to you as the late lamented enemy of your lord skagra i command you to tell me where he has gone
25042,thats it ow ouch
25043,square one thats where weve got to go if we want to find out what skagras up to  once we know that we know where to find him ship i order you to take us to where your lord skagra last came  before arriving here
25044,ship how long will the journey take
25045,what thats neary three months
25046,yes incredibly slow stop
25047,i said stop halt
25048,ship im now going to introduce you to a few new concepts now listen very carefully  reverse the polarity of your main drive feed right
25049,regrade your deossilation diagetic synthesisers by ten points
25050,did i say ten points sorry minus ten points
25051,realign your maxivectal meter on drag so they crossconnect with your radial bicentric arrows
25052,good now this is the easy bit
25053,ive constructed a primitive dimensional stabiliser by remote control the journey will now only take  a couple of minutes to anywhere
25054,oh well lets not harp on that aspect too much shall we
25055,oh come on ship whats taking you so long

26599,a great criminal unique mental powers he had the ability to project his mind into other minds completely take them over didnt he professor
26600,oh no no no no no quite the opposite skagra had the capacity to take minds out of people but he cant put minds back into them thats why he needs salyavin in the sphere and thats why hes going to shada
26601,with skagras mind and salyavins in the sphere skagra will be omnipotent
26602,yes eventually it might take thousands of years but that wouldnt matter his minds immortal it would spread like a disease
26603,skagras mind not a pleasant thought
26604,yes but how hes got a start on us and we dont know where it is
26605,you followed the tardis spacetime track of course of course lets go

26645,k9
26646,k9 stop firing

26650,oh yes itll take a few hours but theyll all get their own minds back
26651,take them back to dear old shada
26652,let the time lords sort it out im not going to play judge and jury it was only forgotten about because the professor  made us forget he didnt want his escape to be discovered that must be why he stole the book when he left gallifrey
26653,well well find out
26654,her little homely dress her favourite cried the old man pressing it to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand shell miss it when she wakes

26886,what have i done
26887,well i cant get everything right
26888,one must always accept the unexpected
26889,well thats different this is the second time ive missed the opening of the brighton pavilion
26890,what
26891,well i cant spend the rest of my life running away from the black guardian
26892,do you have a better suggestion
26893,what
26894,fascinating
26895,argolis tell me about it
26896,its got to be unreal transfer
26897,its the only way to manipulate solid objects
26898,then how is it done
26899,yes nobody there did much with it
26900,do you know id completely forgotten about tachyonics some of those argolin solutions are really quite neat
26901,yes
26902,i suppose in theory a tachyon image could never be permanent
26903,somethings gone wrong
26904,im a doctor
26905,hes terribly hurt come on clear the area clear the area
26906,his mother
26907,yes but whos in charge here
26908,his mother good you take me to his mother come romana on
26909,hello how do you do  who are you ive got something very special here youll like it
26910,who am i ask him
26911,no but its a very understandable mistake
26912,ah well we must have missed the usual channels as usual
26913,well just a glimpse perhaps
26914,you spotted that good lets get back to the tardis
26915,no thank you were just on our way out actually oh by the way there are two unauthorised visitors on the premises keep an ear cocked for a description
26916,dont let me interrupt you gentlemen two discontinuous holograms have been edited together
26917,yes i noticed vague interference patterns
26918,what
26919,oh yes yes that too of course
26920,why are they so competitive
26921,well you could try shorting the servo lock on the door
26922,well its just a thought something wrong
26923,handsome fellow isnt he one of your tachyon images itll disappear soon look
26924,through a hole in the back
26925,there is now
26926,gallifrey
26927,well its just an obscure little planet in the constellation of kasterborous and were overdue i think we should be on our way
26928,well yes but in a purely academic way of no interest to anyone
26929,well id like to
26930,yes there you are so sorry
26931,well just a glimpse perhaps
26932,all right but wed better rerun the experiment dont you think mister hardin
26933,yes radon 222 decays rapidly
26934,really why how long did the war last
26935,as long as that
26936,so its not just a recreation centre
26937,do you think the hives being interfered with
26938,we could do with that in the tardis
26939,yes this leisure hive is the argolin farewell gesture
26940,normal but youre ill
26941,shush
26942,is that a schr�dinger oscillator
26943,why
26944,oh really
26945,ah so thats how its done
26946,oh thank you thank you
26947,yes
26948,arrest the scarf then
26949,im sorry
26950,yes
26951,evidence evidence you couldnt hang a hat on that
26952,im sorry
26953,ive got an idea theres a sort of blue box down the hall you could imprison us both in that
26954,right then ill take my chance
26955,was i in there long it felt like centuries
26956,yes i think so a bit weak why what are you all staring at
26957,no not recently why should
26958,i was just going to check something in there i cant remember what
26959,im sick of being old there must be some way of reversing the process
26960,pangols very young
26961,yes and everyone else is old except pangol and he runs the generator when you were fitting the schr�dinger oscillator did you notice there were two baryon shields
26962,i dont know i didnt have time to look five hundred years goes by so rapidly
26963,yes yes
26964,really its astonishing how far the argolins have come with tachyonics
26965,really are you sure of that
26966,no nothing except a sort of cabinet of illusions and then the name of the thing has that struck you
26967,recreation generator recreation
26968,things yes or people
26969,this way
26970,the radiation out there affected the argolin metabolism
26971,yes and made them sterile
26972,the implications of that could be very unpleasant
26973,yes or else there might be what do you call it
26974,yes or even a plan would do
26975,look at this old thing
26976,theres no doubt about it all this rushing about takes it out of you particularly when youre twelve hundred and fifty years old
26977,who is he
26978,what doesnt make any sense to me
26979,shush dont interrupt hes a foamasi
26980,i dont know ask him
26981,of course of course
26982,i wish i knew what you wanted friend
26983,back to the boardroom our scaly friends seen someone he wants to talk to
26984,well you can trust me thats the important thing
26985,oh no ive got a surprise for you all
26986,mmm it looks genuine to me
26987,if it has ended
26988,dont cross your bridges before theyre hatched
26989,please get on with it theres so little time
26990,the tardis
26991,perfect what a stabilising matrix
26992,the antibaryon shield antibaryon shield antibaryon shield now where was it exactly
26993,its terribly simple its a tachyon image outwardly pangol inwardly me unfortunately these tachyon images are very unstable  doctor 2
26994,come on weve got work to do
26995,shush careful
26996,the first one actually
26997,the first one out of the generator
26998,its hard to tell
26999,fifo stack yes i see what you mean first in first out wheres my hat thank you
27000,well i had concluded that empirically but its nice to have some theoretical background
27001,what mena come on quick
27002,i think i set it on rejuvenation
27003,its too late theyve written out the override
27004,so brock and klout are kaput little pangol
27005,hardin
27006,have a baby
27007,what about it
27008,why not i dont like not knowing where were going to turn up next
27009,some galactic hobo with ideas above his station the cosmos is full of them anyway theres been enough randomising on this job
27010,well then im going to be very glad to get back to work and im missing k9    ltback to the episode listing
27011,no no hovering will do
27012,tigella never heard of it
27013,well were all in somebodys history books
27014,oh yes
27015,why what screens
27016,oh oh those screens well of course ive been to tigella did you say tigella
27017,ive been there
27018,oo well a long time ago nice chap called zastor showed me around yes remind me to get in touch with him sometime in fact ill do it right now
27019,first things first
27020,but not necessarily in that order tigella zastor
27021,hed better not go in the sea in future hes likely to get into deep water you know
27022,quite can you remember where i left his manual
27023,why theyre not hostile
27024,you mustnt believe everything you read in books
27025,it was reasonably friendly to me mind you it was a long time ago
27026,ahem post repair test questions k9 can you hear me  k9
27027,bit of a nuisance if we have to reprogramme all his constants
27028,thats not a problem i happen to be an expert in power sources
27029,no no no a quick flight a quick service
27030,erm er yes yes something like that they didnt actually let me see it last time religious objections
27031,in a cave a sort of shrine
27032,in tigella what
27033,oh
27034,mind you its hardly surprising theyre in awe of the thing after all their whole way of life depends on it
27035,whats the matter
27036,well thats easy just waggle his tail
27037,well done romana well done youre becoming very accomplished at all this
27038,k9 what do you know about the prion planetary system  k9
27039,so now tigellas all thats left  k9
27040,whats the matter
27041,well thats easy just waggle his tail
27042,whats the matter
27043,well thats easy just waggle his tail
27044,thats the third time whats happening
27045,yes then what repeated time cycles oh no it couldnt be a chronic hysteresis could it
27046,yes
27047,whats the matter
27048,well thats easy just waggle his tail
27049,were still looking
27050,yes no thats a terrible idea
27051,theres no known technological procedure im sorry to whisper theres no known technological procedure theres no known technological procedure
27052,whats the matter
27053,well thats easy just waggle his tail
27054,yes thats what you said when you were repairing k9 youd tried everything tried everything weve tried everything of course
27055,can you remember the rest of what you said
27056,k9  k9
27057,yes yes yes before the cycle comes back again
27058,what
27059,yes yes of course good off you go then
27060,whats the matter
27061,ah thats easy just waggle his tail
27062,well done you know for one awful moment i thought youd forgotten your lines
27063,yes
27064,this place has grown up a bit since i was last here
27065,that way  k9
27066,yes ah yes well anyone can make a mistake
27067,well i only got the direction wrong because of tigellas anticlockwise rotation  k9
27068,come on theres no time for botany
27069,hello there im the doctor im expected
27070,what
27071,i say youve got a marvellous memory it must be fifty of your years since i was last here romana k9 do you know where she is  k9
27072,thats odd i could have sworn central control was this way ah excuse me im the doctor im expected
27073,no no its all right im a doctor
27074,i dont know i dont even know where central control is zastor how good to see you will you tell them who i am
27075,please please stay calm im sorry im late we could have been here earlier but for the chronic hysteresis thats a sort of time loop you see
27076,yes my assistant shell be along in a minute anyway zastor how are you
27077,ah
27078,but what about romana
27079,what you mean completely disappeared evaporated
27080,well as i recall the dodecahedron it was much too large to move
27081,im so sorry
27082,i keep telling you i dont know ive only just arrived
27083,yes
27084,in two hour time  you saw me you saw me
27085,i think i see the problem
27086,no no no no wait wait wait there are three possibilities
27087,one the chronic hysteresis ive never been in one before but it just might have projected a time image of me its theoretically possible isnt it
27088,ah
27089,well that makes even less sense
27090,well you see i just dont do that sort of thing
27091,i think what weve got here is a good oldfashioned doppelganger
27092,well thats the problem with doppelgangers you see you never know whos who
27093,right and lets hope that many hands will make the lights work
27094,it would have to be solid assuming some process like baryon multiplication
27095,huh heavy assuming an atomic weight of two hundred not even a dozen tigellans could have carried it away
27096,just how dangerous are the plants
27097,ah in that case i must hurry ive got a friend on the surface
27098,no
27099,i am well id be delighted to help in the ordinary way
27100,not in the ordinary way
27101,wont somebody please say yes
27102,yes but what does this meglos want
27103,zolfathura why would he want to do a thing like that
27104,right
27105,screens what screens
27106,of course the screens of zolfathura
27107,thank you zastor come on romana were in a hurry
27108,shes dead
27109,yes but weve got other things to do other lives to save come on
27110,right now you all stay here
27111,exactly on sight if meglos can impersonate me
27112,right i wont be long
27113,shirt sleeves eh  the doctor takes off his scarf and is about to remove his coat when a gaztak puts his hand on his shoulder he automatically puts his hands up onto the back of a screen
27114,no no more than i would you just mind holding it up for me while i check from inside thats it there we are
27115,well i cut a few corners i say i like his coat now what have we got here
27116,not yet not yet
27117,programmed
27118,oh well it is yes it is nearly just a few minor adjustments i wonder what thats for
27119,oh of course yes of course
27120,youve served me so well i thought you both deserved a little treat
27121,thats it
27122,no no brotadac no the screens dont reach their maximum capacity for two minutes im just going outside for a little stroll to see if i can catch up with myself and i dont recommend anyone touch those controls
27123,oh nasty
27124,ooof
27125,havent i seen you somewhere before
27126,yes theyve not been very clever have they unlike us
27127,well if my calculations are correct they certainly wont
27128,i inverted your control setting if he starts the countdown hell destroy himself as well as you and me and well the whole planet of course
27129,oh yes ive often puzzled about that
27130,well why a good looking chap like you should want to control the universe
27131,yes i mean it baffles me this burning ambition to burning
27132,oh absolutely burning
27133,no meglos hold him
27134,yes
27135,yes hes what youd call a colourful personality
27136,yes but were not quick back to the tardis or do you want to be atomised
27137,yes
27138,good
27139,youre not going to let us down this time are you old girl  brotadac
27140,yes id like to stay and help you but horticultures not my strong point  romana
27141,what
27142,gallifrey do they indeed well well see about that when weve dropped our friend off home unless of course you want to stay here and do some gardening
27143,oh
27144,well dont worry about that we can get you back before you leave
27145,you ready k9  k9
27146,oh yes we cant resist a summons to gallifrey anyway im so looking forward to seeing how leela and andred are getting on you can meet your twin k9 you know romana it romana
27147,yes well you only came to help with the key to time
27148,well you cant fight time lords romana
27149,hmm and lost
27150,im afraid so     k9
27151,i dont know
27152,never mind about that just give me the data  k9
27153,hmm
27154,indeed we have lets take a look shall we
27155,come on its not the end of the universe were home
27156,oh please dont keep apologising try and brighten up    doctor
27157,that is gallifrey that is gallifrey  k9
27158,but its absurd its just absurd  k9
27159,well we cant take off until we find out precisely whats wrong with the tardis
27160,practice practice
27161,what
27162,well of course you heard a noise
27163,what
27164,mistfall
27165,mistfall
27166,what
27167,a blue box really what was it like
27168,quite right were inside it its called a tardis this boys not hallucinating hows your transcendental dimensionalism never mind about that come on k9
27169,well to the marsh we cant stand around here theorising the boy convinces me
27170,whats wrong with what
27171,oh that yes that recurring image of gallifrey well its something really quite simple the image translator reads the absolute values of the coordinates
27172,well its just a thought
27173,nontoxic
27174,theyve stopped moving k9  k9
27175,its as if theyre trying to acclimatise which they seem to be doing rather quickly follow them k9  k9
27176,hello
27177,gently gently cant you see its terrified
27178,a visitor
27179,yes but i sealed it up again i try to leave things as they are shush come on come on youre all right come on everythings going to be all right youre quite safe with me
27180,no no no no no no leave it alone leave it alone shush shush
27181,and i am the doctor
27182,look im sure this ceremonials all terribly impressive
27183,well decider draith was dragged into the swamp what have the marshmen got against you
27184,why cant people be nice to one another just for a change i mean im an alien and you dont want to drag me into a swamp do you you do
27185,well i have a very reliable eyewitness and then when i went to the scene of the crime
27186,yes
27187,well an odd smell i agree but definitely nontoxic
27188,oh come on depends on your point of view
27189,so am i
27190,nice to meet you useless you say listen would you care for a second opinion
27191,what have you done to it
27192,it is
27193,well it wasnt aggressive when i met it anyway its only a baby one
27194,dexeter thats not psychodynamics youve been taking tissue samples
27195,i dont understand your tasks
27196,well youre all so busy maintenance crews everywhere what are you up to
27197,of course are you leaving alzarius
27198,then if youre leaving the planet why all the fuss about the marshmen
27199,well thats life dexeter
27200,there are look isnt it time we were getting it back to its natural habitat
27201,come to think of it its about time i got back to my own natural habitat havent seen a blue box with a light on top have you
27202,its called a tardis it must be out there somewhere
27203,oh i think i can organise something
27204,oh it was just a hypothetical idea
27205,you cant always go by the manuals
27206,certainly
27207,can resist a sonic screwdriver especially in expert hands
27208,excuse me oh what a pity i thought it was an image translator i need one for my ship
27209,at this rate the preparations could take years to complete
27210,generations
27211,yes but too much patience goes absolutely nowhere
27212,yes i have got a vehicle and im feeling rather lost without it
27213,really why would you do a thing like that
27214,oh  man
27215,all right
27216,good heavens its romana romana
27217,what
27218,romana
27219,where is she then
27220,these short trips dont usually work and the chances of reversing a short trip are even more remote still heres hopping would you cross your fingers
27221,romana are you all right
27222,giant crab spiders
27223,you collect k9 together
27224,collect that one too are you sure youre all right romana
27225,shes still alive some kind of coma did you find k9s head
27226,no its not a toxin it must be something in those spider bites some kind of psychochemical
27227,how do i know lets get back to the science unit i want to put some of that spider tissue under the microscope
27228,thats very good very good
27229,dexeter  dexeter
27230,dexeter please stop youve no right please
27231,adric go back to the tardis and wait with romana
27232,yes easy enough to destroy have you ever tried creating one
27233,not an alibi deciders you three are supposed to be leaders
27234,then nefred is responsible
27235,no no perhaps they havent let you in on the secret login shall i tell him gentlemen
27236,yes and the fraud of perpetual movement the endless tasks going round and round the same old components being removed and replaced
27237,preparations for what this starliner isnt going anywhere
27238,ready its been made ready for centuries look
27239,yes the willful procrastination of endless procedure you want to hold onto the old order
27240,true
27241,thats certainly true
27242,oh
27243,whats that
27244,what      man
27245,well
27246,what well so now you know
27247,oh oh
27248,yes the mists and then the high nitrogen content in the spider cells
27249,so its difficult to judge not knowing the norm on this planet we need some tissue samples from dexeter and the marsh child well of course now what did dexeter do with that slide
27250,not now adric not now
27251,what about romana
27252,what what
27253,marshmen in my tardis come on lets find romana    doctor
27254,its the other half of my waistcoat whats that
27255,what
27256,right no more pictures of gallifrey then come on        man
27257,decider
27258,really what did he say exactly what did he say
27259,tell dexeter weve come full circle hows your knee by the way
27260,that was quick
27261,really rapid cellular adaptation that settles it
27262,were going back to the science unit come on man
27263,no no no run and get away take her in the science unit
27264,in the science unit
27265,look youve got alien protein in your brain tissue i havent had time to analyze it yet but im sure effects are probably only temporary please please dont do that look this is your problem think about it psychopathology huh why are you doing this think about it look look k9 you remember k9 and the tardis thats nice stay by the tardis stay by the tardis stay by the tardis
27266,hes dead
27267,but its other peoples property do you think its right going around taking other peoples property
27268,well if it works on the tardis it would definitely prove we were in espace
27269,yes the exospacetime continuum outside our own universe i suspect that what we came through look do you mind if we do one thing at a time good now for a short course in cytogenetics
27270,thank you oh tsk tsk alas poor dexeter reduced to a tangle of stained chromosomes
27271,yes well that should put romana to rights
27272,you understand avoid all contact avoid all contact adric adric the serum
27273,quick the serum
27274,if it doesnt work shes dead how longs it supposed to be since the starliner crashed
27275,forty generations thats a good round figure cant be right though
27276,well evolution goes in quantum leaps but doesnt go that fast
27277,carrier type comparisons yes definitely morphological similar carrier types plus the inversions in bands eight to ten might be significant i need to establish how long the evolutionary process has taken
27278,from spiders to marsh creatures and beyond  romana
27279,yes the deciders procrastinated more than we thought
27280,thats not the marsh creature thats dexeter
27281,thats the marsh creature and thats the spider
27282,adric
27283,what
27284,is he dead poor varsh have you any more oxygen
27285,which will actually make the stuff
27286,splendid enough to fill the whole starliner
27287,no no i think we should let them go
27288,look they adapted quickly
27289,yes
27290,yes still the manuals in the great book room will show them how to put it all together again
27291,yes just like they did forty thousand generations ago theyre your ancestors
27292,oh i dont think so were all basically primeval slime with ideas above its station
27293,yes i see what you mean i suppose they are adaptive intelligent
27294,yes the creatures most willing to survive in it
27295,i know youre not terradonians youre not marsh men either are you which is what they seem to resent
27296,what you mean fly you to terradon
27297,good
27298,shhh ready thrusters 1 2 3 4 and 5
27299,got it
27300,which is that button there gentlemen
27301,have a good flight gentleman
27302,the green button gentleman
27303,they asked me to stay on you know become a decider
27304,yes i decided not too
27305,oh adric and i were too busy to think about you
27306,really an image translator loot he stole that still it might come in useful
27307,yes unfortunately
27308,yes that settles it were out of our own time and space romana
27309,yes what i think we came through was a charged vacuum emboitment
27310,well they made a decision
27311,yes im fine the tardis is feeling a bit queasy
27312,yes so would you be if you were warping about in espace
27313,yes but not you personally
27314,theres a low probability we can slip off home through another cve
27315,please dont keep saying that  k9
27316,well it might be quite nice here
27317,yes we wont know until weve seen the sights met a few more people
27318,come on espace isnt that small somethings bound to turn up
27319,yes i suppose i am really ive never given it much thought  k9
27320,oh knowings easy everyone does that ad nauseam i just sort of hope
27321,well at least theres life
27322,well i put us down close to k9s energy concentration
27323,computers arent infallible
27324,its awfully nice out there k9 protective castle with village dwellings huddled like ducklings round their mother classic medieval scene youd better stay here come on k9 someones got to stay on guard and you can compute a reverse transition from existing data you love doing that eh    doctor
27325,no
27326,hello
27327,well
27328,no no no please just the doctor will do this is romana
27329,how may you serve me well
27330,no no we were just wondering if there were any other scientists
27331,yes scientists you know witchwiggler wangateur fortune teller mundunugu
27332,yes
27333,yes visitors foreign devils you know people you dont know
27334,who lives in this tower of your
27335,please dont shout splendid im sure so you serve the lords but what do the lords do for you
27336,did you say the wasting
27337,oh come on ivo these lords of yours how long have they ruled over you
27338,really as long as that well thats a long time
27339,these people are more complicated than you think you know only to the next village
27340,hmm
27341,oh just bats they come out at night you know what do you mean there isnt another village of course theres another village theres got to be another village just a minute maybe youre right k9s orbital scan the settlement was the only thing to show up on it
27342,hmm
27343,hello im the doctor and this is romana er we were just passing your charming planet and we thought wed just er well drop in look i know this may seem a silly sort of question but we were wondering if you could tell us something about espace espace perhaps not
27344,well its quite a technocotheca youve got here
27345,i dont know i think its some sort of museum
27346,well ive dabbled a bit
27347,what do you mean who are we where do we come from that sort of thing
27348,come on lets not talk about us this looks much more interesting
27349,what isnt that a bit dangerous i mean a chap in the village told me the lords protected you from the wasting
27350,well only by hearsay what is the wasting
27351,yes
27352,ah
27353,what reading forbidden
27354,just a minute got it ha ha
27355,ah lovely old technology back on twentieth century earth the engineers used to just
27356,instead of which they finish up here
27357,yes not bad after a thousand years in memory
27358,yes long since dead
27359,what
27360,who did you see every day
27361,thats two
27362,well i think its time we got to know them dont you romana
27363,thank you
27364,night must fall romana even in espace
27365,never mind its bats quite harmless
27366,come on
27367,funny about the windows
27368,yes and then theres the general architectural style would you call it rococo
27369,just testing a theory
27370,yes
27371,greetings how do you do im the doctor
27372,gosh
27373,oh er well we were just admiring your tower werent we admiring the tower
27374,well you certainly do very well for yourselves here
27375,no no indeed still you do better than the peasants bulls blood i think
27376,quite right probably give them indigestion theres nothing worse than a peasant with indigestion makes them quite rebellious i hear youve been having trouble that way
27377,ah well toodleoo
27378,sorry are you all right
27379,yes we were blown offcourse
27380,we were hoping youd tell us how you got here or better still how to get back
27381,such a pity
27382,surely you realise something here must be wrong
27383,yes
27384,no what is is wrong look societies develop in varying ways yours just seems to be sinking back into some sort of primitivism wouldnt you say so
27385,on level two
27386,an even more powerful force
27387,well mysterious or not those rebels seem to think the power emanates from you
27388,a division yawning chasm id say wouldnt you
27389,oh i wish id thought of that thats a good diagnosis yes ive never seen such a state of decay
27390,ah
27391,what did you say
27392,ship of state
27393,ah its just odd you see that he should mention that because romana and i have just been at your ships old manifest and i cant remember what the ship was called but romana might be able to remember what was it called romana
27394,yes hydrax does that mean anything to you hydrax hydrax
27395,no please dont be silent its so fascinating
27396,you know something i dont think they want to be followed lets sit down
27397,thats very good have you ever heard of the brothers grimm
27398,they also discovered the law of consonantal shift how language changes over the years
27399,hmm
27400,thats right and macmillan becomes
27401,and oconnor becomes
27402,yes and this is the original ship the pilot here copilot there no no no pilot there copilot here instrument banks there control panels there
27403,yes do you fancy exploring it
27404,inspection hatch
27405,shush inspection hatch
27406,hmm
27407,yes its an arrow class scout ship romana it detaches from the main vessel for local exploration
27408,well why bother no one comes here look theres even a bit of power left in the energy cells
27409,possibly
27410,getting out is not exactly the object of our mission is it
27411,shush
27412,shush
27413,more evidence
27414,i have a suspicion but its too horrible to think about
27415,right in the bowels of the ship disused fuel tanks i think
27416,yes
27417,a way out
27418,i doubt very much if the creature lives in the tower but since the tower feeds it i imagine it lives close by
27419,well know that when we find it

27427,yes
27428,do you know what that is
27429,exactly come on
27430,do you know it just occurs to me there are vampire legends on almost every inhabited planet
27431,yes creatures that stalk in the night and feast on the blood of the living creatures that fear sunlight and running water and certain herbs creatures that are so strong they can only be killed by beheading or a stake through the heart
27432,whatever it is we want to find it dont we
27433,good come on then
27434,where
27435,ah
27436,well im glad to catch someone at home are we in time for a guided tour
27437,no
27438,me
27439,what purpose
27440,i could well you know ive never been a great one for swarming its awfully kind of you to offer but where were you thinking of swarming to
27441,ah ha so there was a guided tour
27442,was that when you were just plain science officer oconnor
27443,yes those officers arent the descendants of the originals they are the originals
27444,yes no too dangerous
27445,whos he talking about
27446,adric
27447,no there is a third choice
27448,i can destroy the great one off you go romana
27449,i will not serve i will not serve
27450,cover your eyes romana that might be all right for halfstarved peasantry aukon but it doesnt scare time lords
27451,there was once an old hermit from the mountains of south gallifrey
27452,yes yes he did he used to tell me ghost stories i like a ghost story do you want to hear one
27453,its about a race of giant vampires
27454,mmm they came out of nowhere and swarmed and swarmed
27455,swarmed that was the word he used
27456,they swarmed all over the universe and they were so strong that one single vampire could suck the life out of an entire planet
27457,yes
27458,well he wasnt a scientist there are other ways of looking at life you know anyway according to the story we time lords hunted them down across the universe in a war so long and so bloody that we were sickened of violence forever
27459,one of them escaped i think
27460,just vanished into thin air poof
27461,hmm when was all what supposed to have happened
27462,oh that oh in the misty dawn of history when even rassilon was young
27463,so
27464,and shush
27465,what time vehicles
27466,what time vehicles
27467,psst the tardis is a type forty
27468,yes psst you are wonderful
27469,yes im fine
27470,tarak now listen were going back to our ship for some information i want you to tell kalmar no wait tell kalmar to prepare an attack but not to move until i join you all right
27471,good come on lets go
27472,adric adric where can we start
27473,if that thing down theres what i think it is and if it escaped into our universe billions of lives would be lost could you take me there
27474,come on no no romana you take the tardis and ill take the inner sanctum
27475,good
27476,yes i know i know what do you mean letting stowaways aboard the tardis it isnt a number nine bus you know  k9
27477,well  k9
27478,the record of rassilon
27479,its no good k9  k9
27480,halt dont move look im awfully sorry to drop in on you like this but we do have a bit of a crisis on our hands
27481,lack of weapons no experience odds almost insurmountable but he who outlives this day and comes safe home shall stand atiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of espace
27482,thats the question
27483,yes yes
27484,youve got to be ready you people have had a thousand years to rid yourselves of this evil and now all youve got are three hours
27485,where do you think zargo and his friends got their powers
27486,no and thats the very devil of it if i had any instruments with me i could show you
27487,scanner scanner
27488,range
27489,right now kalmar youll see im telling you the truth gather round gentlemen hang on a minute hang on a minute itll take a moment or two for the picture to steady there we are oh it seems to scan right through the spectrum
27490,yes the spectrums a bit weak at the moment infrared picking up sleeping life forms now were going into xray watch the area below the tower
27491,the heartbeat of the great vampire well kalmar
27492,our hq the tower now we can take the tower between us
27493,aukon and his friends will be distracted by the ceremony
27494,well there are ways of dealing with guards
27495,yes but that was after a long and bloody war and they had bow ships that fire mighty bolts of steel and pierced each vampires heart
27496,their cardiovascular systems incredibly efficient they can just seal over minor wounds yes theres a very practical reason for the traditional wooden stake
27497,no i doubt if even that would be big enough and anyway how could we propel it mighty bolt of steel
27498,of course of course an arrow of steel and ive been looking at it all this time right gentlemen lets gather round and finalise our plans now we need a group of your best men a sort of commando force
27499,no
27500,and a dead shot with a nose laser
27501,k9  k9
27502,good good
27503,the others have gone therefore the ceremony must have started now listen to me all of you i want you to hold this tower until k9 gives the signal
27504,one day youll apologise for that
27505,shush never mind just trust me itll work after k9s signal you evacuate the tower and make your way round to the caves if you should find romana and adric see if you can rescue them and get away from here as far and as fast as you can got it good go stop dont forget k9 gives the signal
27506,three scoutships three chances now which one first this one
27507,come on dead as a dinosaur the circuits must be corroded have to try one of the others
27508,one to go
27509,come on come on what happened to all that earth craftsmanship eh just because youve been laid up for a thousand years
27510,romana right time for me to tell you what happened
27511,right yes
27512,dont worry dont worry have you ever heard the expression what goes up must come down
27513,i wish i hadnt
27514,get down get down
27515,well i just fired off one of the rocket ships you see and i arranged the controls so that it went straight up
27516,ah well they just went to pieces
27517,yes
27518,it was nothing
27519,yes
27520,go on then
27521,there that should do it well kalmar theres all the knowledge youll need in there use it well and if thats what you want you can be a high technological society in no time
27522,good good
27523,yes
27524,yes inside you two we just have to get on with this
27525,well i really dont know you see we came here by accident but you were brought here by the great vampires brain and his secret died with him kalmar such good luck
27526,and you young man youre going straight home  the doctor follows romana and adric into the tardis  adric
27527,havent you done enough damage already
27528,here let me have a try just needs a little friendly persuasion thats all
27529,probably too friendly i said a little friendly firm but friendly watch  the juddering stops
27530,its jammed ive lost control were adrift in espace
27531,have we
27532,maybe thats it
27533,the way out of espace
27534,i dont know what im doing im just following intuition
27535,whats so improbable about tossing a coin never heard of the iching
27536,random samplings that affect the broad flow of the material universe
27537,the holistic view
27538,its always darkest before the storm
27539,dawn isnt that right k9
27540,yes well that might help
27541,you didnt really think id activate the reverse bias did you huh its extremely difficult to generate nondeterminate action i mean ha maybe subconsciously i wanted to press that button
27542,yes in full flight
27543,no i dont think so dont you want to get back to gallifrey
27544,well well burn that bridge when we come to it its all academic unless we find the cve
27545,what about adric
27546,so
27547,oh hell love it on gallifrey
27548,adric
27549,good
27550,of course thats how he got in hes on a different timeline
27551,about the same way as we can see him
27552,others
27553,the shadow of his past
27554,romana check those coordinates
27555,yes now listen you two stay here and hold the fort im going to follow biroc come on k9 k9 come on he wasnt built to withstand this type of punishment come on now come on
27556,hes still alive
27557,yes
27558,yes ponder on that
27559,youre a machine i usually get on so well with machines i dont suppose you happen to know the way out into nspace do you i believe its somewhere around here its er
27560,theyve cut each other dead
27561,poor things hardly any better off than k9 ah ha memory wafer
27562,what particular brutes did you have in mind
27563,gateway gateway to where
27564,gateway to where just as it was getting interesting if only i had an alternative source of energy  k9
27565,listen k9 im sorry to have to ask you to do this but all this stuff about the gateway is terribly important  k9
27566,yes well look look im sure this is frightfully interesting could you get back on to the bit about the gateway please
27567,your ordinary world im from nspace
27568,ah ha
27569,well
27570,the thing is its not actually a physical gateway that im looking for
27571,ah so it is here the way out
27572,oh hello you seem to have attracted a big audience
27573,ah ahem he er he doesnt seem to be too sure of his lines
27574,all the gateways are one all the gateways are one you see im so sorry hes completely run down im the doctor by the way and thats k9 and we just happened to
27575,gundans eh
27576,stop that gundan
27577,biroc how did i get through the mirror
27578,what    aldo
27579,but what about k9 the time winds positively blasted him can he pass through the mirror
27580,k9 if we can get him through the mirror will it repair him
27581,what thats right yes i have look look
27582,then we must get him here
27583,so k9 can only be revived on this side of the mirror
27584,no dont go dont go please where is this place where have you brought us
27585,what the gateway still but thats nowhere
27586,i see i see espace thats right yes for you people its a jumping off point for espace but for nontime sensitives biroc biroc i understand biroc hes gone again its like talking to a cheshire cat
27587,i must be crossing the striations of the time lines
27588,my goodness you live like kings
27589,ah so this is what it was all like
27590,i notice you dont do too badly for staff this garden of yours the universe how do you manage it
27591,including her
27592,so youre the masters the gundan spoke of the enslavers
27593,yes yes this is no way to run an empire
27594,yes
27595,yes its alarming isnt it and the culinary arrangements are variable too
27596,much the best way if you can do it
27597,shush not so aggressive were all in the same boat and they know it
27598,i do
27599,oh no no one way only thats for tharils
27600,a hungry bunch now listen theres nothing beyond those mirrors for people like us except the reflection of whats here only the tharils can enter your universe that way and thats a talent theyre born with the talent that you hunt them for
27601,yes now unless we work very closely together we could be caught here until the crack of doom oh whats the use could i have one of your pickles i had a rush lunch
27602,well that goes for all of us yeah soon we wont be better off than that chap over there
27603,k9 where have you been my dear old thing
27604,dont say that he may have a point what mass conversion anomaly  k9
27605,what
27606,no thats not funny thats whats causing it  k9
27607,i think not if k9s right and he usually is this place is in worse shape than we thought it was
27608,soon it may not even be that
27609,quite a lot how long have we got k9  k9
27610,slowly
27611,yes yes but it would need a huge mass to disturb time and space to that extent even the tardis doesnt weigh that much neither does their ship
27612,what
27613,dwarf star alloy what are you playing at is it something to do with these
27614,yes trading in time sensitives and dwarf star alloy is the only material that will hold them
27615,how many more of those poor creatures have you got in that hulk of yours
27616,no wild theory about contraction k9 no k9 k9
27617,yes as the domain contracts
27618,playing for time quite the reverse
27619,yes and if i can get back to my tardis i can prove it and find out exactly how much time we have left
27620,hello biroc
27621,as you said the weak enslave themselves
27622,i wish you luck but what about us have you got any ideas on that count
27623,what
27624,biroc biroc its all very well for you but
27625,oh hes just a friend of mine adric romana get k9 outside quickly
27626,dont move lads its on automatic
27627,yes well thats one of the advantages of living in a rapidly shrinking microuniverse
27628,other what
27629,shush mass attraction theres something moving out there its shaking the entire gateway
27630,back blast
27631,back blast hes going to use the jets to try and smash through the mirrors
27632,yes
27633,yes
27634,shush
27635,im not hopeful
27636,yes what damaged area
27637,what
27638,yes

27640,thats an order its about time you started accepting orders
27641,with my eyes
27642,good come on
27643,i like that i think youre improving
27644,indifference thirteen and a half minutes
27645,look here rorvik youve got to stop this back blast youll kill us all
27646,you cant blast through those mirrors you must realise by now it just throws the energy straight back
27647,never mind the clipboard short the cables
27648,biroc what are you doing here
27649,its all right for you
27650,do nothing
27651,yes thats right do nothing if its the right sort of nothing
27652,weve made it quick quick inside whats the matter
27653,inside thats an order
27654,what what a moment to choose
27655,no no no wait wait theres something else k9 hell be all right with you behind the mirrors
27656,ill miss you you were the noblest romana of them all
27657,yes
27658,so it has nothing well thats something
27659,well if the espace image translator doesnt work im hoping were in nspace
27660,yes
27661,did i say sure
27662,yes one solid hopes worth a cartload of certainties
27663,all right shell be superb  ltback to the episode listing
27664,yes the old home universe its many times larger than anything youre used to
27665,yes
27666,well just the interesting ones
27667,well law of probability that sort of thing you know anyway were supposed to be on our way back to gallifrey
27668,no what adric i give you a privileged insight into the mystery of time yes
27669,open your mind to adventures beyond imagining yes
27670,and you criticise my logic
27671,ah ah oh youve noticed that have you well i mean anyone can talk sense as long as thats understood you and i are going to get on splendidly
27672,metulla orionsis id say does that make sense
27673,yes thats an interesting planetary system
27674,eh youre beginning to get the hang of this console yes traken  traken union famous for its universal harmony a whole empire held together by
27675,well by people just being terribly nice to each other
27676,yes i dont think ive actually been there just know it by repute so ill tell you all about it sometime
27677,going to traken who said so
27678,you set them
27679,but i didnt did i i wonder what the law of probability would say about that
27680,i thought so
27681,i thought you might appreciate it if i gave you the impression i knew what was happening we could panic of course but where would that get us
27682,i dont know
27683,adric
27684,adric if i knew everything that was going to happen where would the fun be
27685,its all right adric the keeper of traken
27686,oh well it wasnt difficult to guess whod taken possession of the tardis i mean there cant be many people in the universe with the capacity of just dropping in like this
27687,shush time reveals everything adric what can we do for you keeper
27688,yes yes i know that feeling
27689,oh come on its still fairly impressive i mean i couldnt flit around the universe in an old chair like this
27690,right
27691,how so keeper
27692,shush
27693,oh hes not local
27694,yes they say the atmosphere there was so full of goodness that evil just shrivelled up and died maybe thats why i never went there
27695,oh please keeper please
27696,melkur
27697,so what becomes of this melkur
27698,well that particular evil seems to be well under control
27699,sense what keeper
27700,anything i can do keeper
27701,shush well well see well see
27702,yes isnt it what do you make of it
27703,so do i we
27704,knowledge accumulated wisdom of centuries
27705,well theyre just a couple of my old time logs you know i really may have been to traken its so difficult to keep track of
27706,oh yes mind you i dont bother now much too busy actually this might not be the right volume here take that and make yourself useful
27707,well you know traken keepers allpervading evil
27708,yeah anything along those lines
27709,what
27710,and
27711,so
27712,ah yes well i suppose it is a bit above your head mind you they did say i had a very sophisticated prose style
27713,handwriting what about my handwriting
27714,weve arrived right now lets see what this place really looks like
27715,hmm looks pretty well calcified to me
27716,fiddlesticks
27717,put your hands up in the air like that
27718,i wondered when you were going to ask you know i hate to say this sort of thing but traken hospitality isnt what it used to be
27719,its probably the usual misunderstanding we keep running into this sort of thing actually we were invited here this time
27720,yes to pitch in help out that sort of thing
27721,well excuse my name dropping but the keeper actually
27722,in a manner of speaking yes
27723,well unless hes in the habit of soliciting help yes
27724,yes
27725,yes we thought wed walk the rest of the way you know fresh air stretch the legs
27726,yes
27727,look why dont we summon up the keeper or something
27728,sorry to trouble you keeper but we do seem to have a problem here
27729,keeper tell us
27730,consuls youre making a big mistake im sure youre all charming reasonable people at heart
27731,the least you can do is hear what we have to say
27732,quite and adric and i are willing to stamp with the best of them but lets stamp with some justice and precision consuls you saw what happened your keeper was attacked
27733,yes someone here or someone very near here
27734,did she say melkur
27735,a force was certainly brought to bear upon the keeper from some quarter tell me more about this melkur
27736,no not at all a high energy beam and if i had the right instrument
27737,yes and so i see are you tremas isnt it been investigating high energy forcefields eh
27738,well ive dabbled a bit in the bioelectronics line may i cast an eye over that
27739,plasma fields of this strength couldnt have been generated without some pretty formidable magnetic containment im hardly tooled up for that sort of thing
27740,consequences
27741,ah yes yes very civil of you consul and well do our very best to try and return the compliment wont we adric
27742,a sort of house arrest well that suits us eh adric
27743,its been here again
27744,whatever it was that was here last time
27745,those stones have been hit by a plasma beam theyre disintegrated look the suns coming up youre right it is morning tremas you know what i need more than anything else in the universe
27746,breakfast is your place far
27747,well if you dont mind i think its high time we got down to work
27748,well the first thing we ought to do is find my tardis
27749,hello
27750,oh fine fine its always nice to be reprieved listen you didnt notice a tall blue box with a lamp on top out there did you
27751,i know that tardis tremas its got to be out there somewhere
27752,thank you
27753,is something the matter
27754,huh thats hardly likely
27755,well i can see the force of that argument but what im more interested in is finding my
27756,really
27757,citizen trouble there
27758,theres someone in there
27759,dont shes in some sort of trance
27760,yes from the melkur thing
27761,its limitless organising capacity refined to a single frame and obedient to the will of your keeper a great achievement tremas and a great temptation to people less principled than ourselves
27762,now we put it down about yes here hmm
27763,its here its just been displaced slightly by the current time cone now whats the simplest way around this id like to set up a standing wave something the autosystems can home in on
27764,well itll be a start
27765,i thought i told you to stay with nyssa
27766,shush cant it wait
27767,all right come on through here
27768,the doctor thinks you might have a very good point this certainly looks like a tardis generator but you dont get shift ratios of this magnitude in an ordinary type forty adric we have a full backflow inducer in the making here
27769,there we are a fully fledged full backflow inducer
27770,yes
27771,quick the vault the vault
27772,youre forgetting about the tardis adric come on come on
27773,well give it a moment or two trust me
27774,so youre the cause of all this
27775,adric tremas dont look at its eyes
27776,he should be all right come on hes only stunned
27777,well quite a little home from home
27778,not till we came along that is
27779,some sort of electron lock still sonic screwdriver should do it
27780,seems a bit far along be a good chap will you and nip outside and unlock it for me im not a magician you know
27781,the keepers not dead yet so we still have a little time
27782,whatever happens melkur must not be allowed to make contact with the source
27783,exactly
27784,lovely day huh theyre not a very talkative lot your fosters tremas
27785,why why should she anyway ah a friendly face
27786,nyssa nyssa the lock
27787,right
27788,what i must remember never to fall out with your daughter tremas may i look at that yes very clever no selfrespecting fugitive should be without one
27789,back to the tardis much the safest place if we can get there
27790,its the only way in just stay calm eh ill think of something
27791,ah good morning or afternoon or is it evening its very difficult to keep track of time around here
27792,ah
27793,oh yes
27794,tremas weve got to get out of these corridors and lie low somewhere
27795,good thinking adric come on tremas lead on
27796,well the new regime seems to be making rather a mess of things tremas tremas
27797,blueprints master plans do you happen to keep them here
27798,well the master plans to the source manipulator of course
27799,tremas we must stop kassia becoming the keeper and for that we need the master plans
27800,well of course you swore an oath now you have to choose your personal honour against the safety of the whole of traken
27801,well thats fine thats fine tremas i mean when this thing has taken over the entire source youll have the consolation of knowing that you kept your honour intact
27802,good
27803,now nyssa you stand on guard its magnificent magnificent its a pity about that poor chap having to sit for thousands of years in a chair but it is magnificent
27804,yes i can see theres something in that adric put your mind to that
27805,agreed yes i wonder could it be tripped
27806,oh dangerous thoughts tremas dangerous thoughts look adric warp crossover connected there shutdown element there and
27807,well only if the servo blew
27808,well it could be done tricky and i hope not necessary yes thank you tremas put that away safely will you nyssa how are the fun and games over there
27809,good lets get back to the tardis off you go come on off you go
27810,well
27811,neither do i still what cant be cured must be endured
27812,yes yes dont listen to me i never do come on come on
27813,no it is very quiet wait wait come on quickly
27814,what is it
27815,what imagination come on
27816,well clarity is the soul of knowing what the other chaps going to do what are you going to do
27817,what
27818,yes and kassia will be the next keeper unless we make the sanctum
27819,oh yes yes were still here dont write us off yet will you
27820,consul dont do it
27821,consul kassia has betrayed you all dont complete the transition
27822,dont listen to her consul
27823,its our only chance secure the tardis take nyssa with you and wait
27824,your new keeper
27825,well i know its not exactly what you had in mind but now im afraid youre rather stuck with him
27826,i should do it consul if i were you hell make you
27827,huh no compulsion youve changed your tune
27828,my only ambition is to stop you melkur
27829,i want to get a closer look at that melkur creature i have the oddest feeling weve met somewhere before
27830,if you ask me poor old kassia didnt have much say in the matter
27831,hell destroy you too neman just as he destroyed kassia
27832,shush
27833,a creaction melkur all sweetness and reason because hes vulnerable
27834,well then perhaps we could apply the ultimate sanction
27835,what even though weve got the master plans of the source manipulator
27836,which in our case we have not got whats that piece of mechanism oh of course a recursive integrator hmm how are the rings encoded
27837,i see then therell be a single large prime number at the root of it and we dont have the integer key what a pity you still havent got your own ring
27838,oh i dont know i know one or two shortcuts
27839,dear me he seems to be almost back on form
27840,all right all right melkur theres no need to show off your powers as keeper we know what you can do
27841,tremas why dont you do as he asks its only a bit of paper after all you know why he wants it he doesnt want you to show it to me
27842,afraid i might spoil your fun
27843,oh by the way by the way neman neman come here you chaps might be interested in this as well
27844,so far its going magnificently melkurll be out of action for a while lets try and make that a permanent arrangement shall we come on
27845,come on through here come on
27846,not a very pleasant thought i had considered a more drastic solution
27847,no just an idea that adric and i had
27848,eight eight seven one zero another zero thats a bad sign
27849,what
27850,no three more digits to go
27851,shush weve still got a chance just remember three three seven
27852,thats a very popular delusion
27853,old scores
27854,all this and that too how do you propose to manage that
27855,of course the master
27856,i used to know an ancient remedy for mad dogs i must look it up some time good library here have you
27857,i thought you meant to destroy me
27858,then that is the end for a time lord
27859,adric three three seven
27860,you know i was going to mention that i think that one of you two should step into the breach if you want to keep this quaint old custom going
27861,you just missed your chance of becoming keeper yet again but confidentially i think that youre very lucky
27862,really
27863,ah well im afraid your lucks just run out adric and i have got to fly come on adric
27864,well she seems to be going right as ninepence now
27865,oh probably the master up to one of his little party tricks again then the general rundown condition it badly needs an overhaul
27866,well it involves an awful lot of recalculation and this types not really my forte
27867,oh guesswork mostly
27868,yes it did didnt it adric wouldnt it be nice to be right about everything
27869,chameleon circuit
27870,look whenever you see me in this part of the tardis pacing up and down like this be a good chap and dont interrupt me will you unless its terribly urgent its not terribly urgent is it
27871,good so now youll know in fact theres no need for you to come barging in here at all but if it is terribly urgent you can always ring the cloister bell
27872,yes
27873,well its a sort of communications device reserved for wild catastrophes and sudden calls to man the battle stations
27874,no no no nothing along those lines i sometimes think i should be running a tighter ship
27875,yes the second law of thermodynamics is taking its toll on the old thing entropy increases
27876,yes daily the more you put things together the more they keep falling apart and thats the essence of the second law of thermodynamics and i never heard a truer word spoken come on come on
27877,gallifrey oh yes yes are you really set on going to gallifrey
27878,oh
27879,thats one of the questions i was just pondering theres bound to be an awful lot of fuss about romana why she stayed in espace official investigations that sort of thing
27880,what she has broken the cardinal rule of gallifrey she has become involved and in a pretty permanent sort of way i think that you and i should let a few oceans flow under a few bridges before we head back home
27881,yes let me put another question to you i have a place in mind thats on the way well more or less give or take a parsec or two its my home from home its called earth
27882,thats the chap
27883,britain is thats the one place where we can find these blue boxes
27884,yes but theyre not no spacious accommodation no viewer screens they dont even time travel just elementary earth communications devices and more or less obsolete by the time well be arriving there theres some in the north that are still in use
27885,but not a police box
27886,yes what the mathematical model of a tardis exterior is based upon
27887,because i want to measure it
27888,block transfer computation
27889,im not surprised logopolis is a quiet little planet
27890,no thats the other place we go to logopolis afterwards
27891,no no no its all to do with the chameleon circuit problem we measure the police box on earth then we take the measurements afterwards to logopolis come on ill show you
27892,the cloister bell
27893,well nothing when its not ringing
27894,apparently not
27895,yes or else our old friend entropys nibbling away at the system circuitry lets take a look
27896,well its only the exterior of a tardis that exists as a real spacetime event
27897,precisely thats very good
27898,ah well thats a sore point according to the handbook yeah because the outer plasmic shell of a tardis is driven by the chameleon circuit or so the theory runs in practice i always meant to ask romana to help me fix it one day
27899,yes still the future lies this way
27900,exactly
27901,in a totters yard anyway it was ages ago it doesnt matter she was in on gallifrey for repair when i borrowed her
27902,well on a sort of finderskeepers basis yes i should have waited till theyd done the chameleon conversion but there were other pressing reasons at the time anything happening up there
27903,good ah
27904,well its an early version the instructions have to be punched in by machine code
27905,boring in theory we should be able to do things like this
27906,well weve got to be able to get in and out
27907,thats how the master hid from us on traken anyway if this worked id just have to punch a few buttons like this and wed be a pyramid
27908,yes im not sure we should be distinctive
27909,yes but since we left traken and then the cloister bell
27910,mmm
27911,yes ah earth nearly there
27912,at least i suppose its a miss but i thought just for once wed materialise on the right coordinates
27913,thats what i just said what a landing no no no no dont open the door
27914,theres no need to draw attention to ourselves theres a simpler way if i can just organise it the tardis and i are getting rather better at these short hops
27915,i hope not that could produce some unpleasant dimensional anomalies no its just an ordinary police box around which weve materialised with considerable finesse i hope youve noticed
27916,no no no leave it alone
27917,three point six seven metres normal to the back surface
27918,it has to be measured in every dimension
27919,in every dimension i need every detail the logopolitans convert that into a precise mathematical model
27920,well to overlay it on the tardis
27921,well its a way of modelling spacetime events through pure calculation
27922,no transcendentally its quite hard to explain in a word
27923,yes i meant to do it all of course when they first offered to do the chameleon conversion for me its highly specialised but they say itll work leg up
27924,because the actual workingouts incredibly tedious lots of fiddly computations much better to leave it to the logopolitans they do it standing on their heads
27925,standing on their heads is an expression
27926,as a matter of fact they dont use computers they use word of mouth
27927,no
27928,mutter intone
27929,yes
27930,ive wondered that myself i never quite had the nerve to ask them
27931,no
27932,well wed better not dematerialise till ive investigated i have a feeling im overlooking the obvious again back in two shakes
27933,what
27934,a tardis perhaps
27935,yes down to the last detail no wait wait
27936,its too early to tell
27937,i hope not because if it is well never get out of it
27938,we cant go back now
27939,we must be getting near to the nucleus of the bubble
27940,another tardis
27941,yes someones been here before us stay here adric
27942,which vehicle
27943,no
27944,so he did escape from traken
27945,but hes still about somewhere
27946,yes the master
27947,me lucky you dont think that i you do think
27948,well i do have opinions this is the calling card of the most evil genius in the universe and i have to tell you gentlemen ive got to get after him now if youll just help me to create a diversion hmm
27949,id love to
27950,would you mind awfully if i stopped to telephone my solicitor
27951,it seems were going to be awfully busy at this station of yours i mean isnt that a telephone box
27952,but that would do fine dont you agree
27953,er no
27954,it could be anywhere in the tardis
27955,absolutely
27956,a choice of emergencies wed better dematerialise first
27957,the tardis is very sluggish we may not have any choice at all
27958,well shut the door then there must be some way of simplifying this architectural configuration thats the one
27959,interior allocation of space adric im going to jettison romanas room
27960,this is life nothings sure
27961,look do you want a quick decision or a debate
27962,you see theres no need to shout
27963,yes
27964,somehow i rather doubt that come on adric
27965,why dont you answer it go on go on
27966,yes so now we know
27967,the message was very faint it was from traken
27968,nyssas all right
27969,vanished the master must have had a second tardis hidden away somewhere
27970,to renew himself he was very near the end of his twelfth regeneration
27971,yes
27972,well not just a time lord by himself but with some of the powers of the keepership still lingering huh and i was so sure i was so sure he must have known i was going to fix the chameleon circuit
27973,well hes a time lord in many ways we have the same mind
27974,no how can we with the master in the tardis theyre a retiring people they like a quiet life theres no telling what a creature like that would do on logopolis
27975,and theres no saying what that might do to the tardis systems can you swim
27976,good materialise the tardis underwater and open the door
27977,yes adric shut down everything fold back the omega configuration
27978,good exponential crossfield
27979,good pathways to conditional states seven to seventeen
27980,excellent main and auxiliary drive
27981,good now were partially materialised so therell be a slight jolt are you ready
27982,what well id feel more confident if you just said yes
27983,good here we go then
27984,we must have touched bottom
27985,yes good thing the water was there to break our fall
27986,careful now the water pressure could send us both flying ready
27987,now
27988,ah i thought theres be a perfectly simple explanation
27989,nearly but not quite right theres something not quite right about all of this
27990,nothing like this has ever happened before ive got to get to the bottom of this you stay here
27991,set
27992,logopolis
27993,ive just dipped into the future we must be prepared for the worst
27994,hmm how do you deduce that
27995,never guess unless you have to theres enough uncertainty in the universe as it is
27996,in the ordinary way yes this is something far too serious
27997,a chain of circumstances that fragments the law that holds the universe together
27998,yes that aerials a recent addition
27999,you are
28000,you and i have to part company
28001,adric dont argue
28002,who is she where did she come from what are we going to do with her
28003,your aunt woman in the white hat red sports car
28004,well a little of her that settles it shes got to come with us
28005,well its very nice of you to put it like that monitor
28006,shush were all very honoured to be here
28007,logopolis
28008,yes the antennas new monitor
28009,if your computations can help solve a problem in my tardis id be eternally grateful monitor
28010,yes all noted down monitor i dont wish to press you but my problem is now extremely urgent
28011,yes yes
28012,thats right
28013,yes historically the logopolitans do everything
28014,the numbers hes recreating the tardis
28015,thank you monitor im certainly looking forward to having a properly functioning tardis
28016,oh indeed monitor indeed
28017,do you really feel up to an explanation
28018,well adric you explain
28019,splendid monitor ive really been looking forward to this of course the pharos project but this is a near replica of the pharos computer room
28020,what
28021,what you can model the pharos project mathematically
28022,well then you can model any spacetime event in the universe
28023,yes yes
28024,a famous earth project to transmit signals to remote planets
28025,ah
28026,adric and the girl would you look after them for me
28027,no what lies ahead is for me not for them i hate farewells
28028,must dematerialise dematerialise nothing working nothing
28029,theyve arrested the dimension spiral things are looking up
28030,an error in the dimension subroutine somewhere here i will not be beaten i simply will not be beaten but i could certainly do with a little more help from outside
28031,the cheeseboard is the world and the pieces the phenomena of the universe as my old friend huxley used to say cheese board chess board and the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes nor makes the smallest concession to ignorance
28032,monitor
28033,i cant thank you enough
28034,you too tegan you too where are the others
28035,what they should know better than that thereve been enough unnecessary deaths as it is
28036,and the murder of innocent earth people
28037,yes
28038,yes im so sorry tegan im so sorry
28039,adric nyssa come on
28040,i dont want you two chasing after the master independently you adric should know how dangerous he is
28041,yes
28042,yes
28043,indeed i did and i am prepared for the worst
28044,because hes here
28045,theres much more to this block transfer computation than we thought
28046,yes yes but why why build a replica of the pharos project central register
28047,quite
28048,and i was vain enough to think it was me he was after logopolis is his target
28049,thats not your father tremas is dead murdered by him the master
28050,this is not conquest its devastation
28051,which is killing the logopolitans and turning them to dust
28052,yes
28053,youre interfering with the law of cause and effect
28054,dont you understand logopolis is crucial to the whole of creation this could mean the end of the universe
28055,then come into the streets and see whats happening
28056,the numbers were supporting the whole system
28057,the entropy you released is eroding your systems too
28058,dont
28059,passed the point
28060,we passed through one of your voids monitor
28061,not quite
28062,i cant choose the company i keep
28063,in the circumstances yes
28064,if we dont cooperate therell be no question of gallifrey
28065,please shush as time lords you and i have special responsibilities
28066,ive never chosen my own company nyssa it was you who contacted me and begged me to help you find your father tegan its your own curiosity that got you into this and adric a stowaway
28067,did i say there was no one in it
28068,i dont want any further argument one two three of you into the tardis quickly go on
28069,its impossible my friend in there will look after you im collaborating with the master now go on battle stations
28070,one last hope
28071,the monitor wouldnt abandon us
28072,yes maybe it was the last addition to logopolis it might be the last one to survive we need his knowledge come on
28073,the rot is spilling outwards into the universe from this point after eons of constraint come on lets collect the monitor and get out
28074,yes arent i
28075,monitor the stability of
28076,what do you mean the advanced research project
28077,monitor were you on the right track you must tell us about the project in every detail
28078,yes
28079,tegan i told you to get out of here
28080,as safe as houses eh
28081,no no no no listen reconfigure the two tardises into time cone inverters it would work what a brilliant mind
28082,the monitors programme you can help me
28083,yes i want this in pieces
28084,bubble memory
28085,yes you realise what this means
28086,bubble memory is nonvolatile remove the power and the bit patterns are still retained in tiny magnetic domains in these chips the research teams final project is still here
28087,ive an idea where we could find one on earth
28088,yes the masters tardis come on
28089,one good lift deserves another dont you think
28090,earth please
28091,yes i envy you your tardis master
28092,shush
28093,im so sorry i thought you meant to shoot him
28094,yes
28095,oh i dont know its a sort of vague faith in the nature of things i suppose
28096,yes well its the ageold battle isnt it entropy versus structure still while theres life theres six of one and half a dozen of the other
28097,yes but very comforting when worn next to the skin
28098,any good
28099,of course the programmes not being fed into the core
28100,we start again
28101,well well just have to wait until the data reaches the cve
28102,yes
28103,i suggest we use your tardis
28104,weve still got to get across to the antenna control room
28105,good
28106,three c four six one
28107,you overlooked the light speed overdrive
28108,thank you
28109,what and powered up i see
28110,the datas reached the cve its stabilising
28111,you did most of this
28112,youre quite right one mistake now could ruin everything
28113,what do you mean
28114,youre mad    master
28115,youre utterly mad
28116,only while that cable holds
28117,its the end but the moment has been prepared for
28118,its the end but the moment has been prepared for
28119,i oh
28120,ah youve come to help me find the zero room welcome aboard im the doctor or will be if this regeneration works out
28121,now ordinary spaces of course show up on the architectural configuration indicators but any good zero room is balanced to zero energy with respect to the world outside its four walls or however many walls it has
28122,gone really did she leave a note
28123,well if we did we did
28124,there are strong dimensioning forces this deep in the tardis tend to make one a bit giddy
28125,i dont know i can feel it isnt going to be as smooth as on other occasions sooner we get to this zero room place the better eh
28126,i left a waistcoat like that on ever been to alzarius
28127,really its a small universe isnt it
28128,not far now brigadier if the ice warriors dont get there first oh no oh dear weve wandered into the wrong corridor we must be close to the main tardis drive now jamie jamie you go back
28129,no nonsense be sensible go back when i say run run dont you understand the regeneration is failing
28130,adric adric not that way adric i remembered his name
28131,thats the trouble with regeneration you never quite know what youre going to get
28132,well i suppose ill get used to it in time
28133,the zero room door i heard it slam
28134,fit as a fiddle vicki but something very peculiar is going on in the tardis the zero room have you seen it anywhere
28135,good ill follow you
28136,hello carmine seepage
28137,oh thats a relief i thought the tardis autosystems were playing up again dreadful always going wrong its time we went to logopolis to get it all sorted out once and for all
28138,zero room oh its very big empty sort of grey pinkishgrey
28139,thank you you must be tegan works even better if you close the doors nyssa
28140,yes ive never quite understood why its quite peaceful isnt it
28141,oh just until my dendrites heal  the nervous systems a very delicate network of logic junctions
28142,oh yes i was forgetting nyssa bioelectronics is your strong point yes well my tussle with the master came at precisely the wrong moment when the synapses are weak theyre like radio receivers picking up all sorts of jumbled signals
28143,completely even the gravitys only local goodness me im tired
28144,bed oh i dont need a bed not in the zero room
28145,oh you dont do it it just sort of comes to you like sleep very like sleep we only just made it to the zero room in time doctor
28146,whats the matter
28147,there seems to be something distinctly wrong i can feel it
28148,oh worse than that the tardis is in danger whos in the console room
28149,and adric
28150,well is he or isnt he
28151,adric isnt what tell me
28152,ive got to do something
28153,tablets the mixture the ointment
28154,the potion the solution oh my little friend if only you were
28155,go softly on
28156,smoke heat and noise adrenaline and neuropeptides the brains working
28157,the manual override nyssa ill have to explain how to vent the thermobuffer listen very carefully my concentration may go again at any moment
28158,this will be simpler of course if you go into hover mode first always remembering of course not to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow the whole system is on manual now this is where it starts to get really dangerous
28159,the temperature will start coming down fairly quickly but without that stimulus my neuropeptide level will fall to normal
28160,good good now as soon as full console functions are restored you can start to reprogram the architectural configuration id better show you
28161,oh the architectural configuration system can do more than that we can actually delete rooms
28162,yes exactly zap enough zap and you have your thrust now follow this very carefully
28163,mass in motion thrust if you like time for lessons later
28164,yes well dont worry it works we had to do that once with adric to get away from by the way where is adric
28165,well where we need him
28166,well
28167,well tell me later theres not much time once the star field reaches critical mass well be shut into the inrush where were we jo deleting rooms
28168,shush come on weve got to finish this seventeen thousand tons of thrust say twenty five percent of the architecture
28169,doesnt matter same thrust
28170,yes
28171,oh yes thats the trouble with manual override
28172,get k9 to explain it to you good luck
28173,castrovalva
28174,how do we get there
28175,are you sure
28176,when the tardis is on manual you cant be certain of anything
28177,its harder to fly than you think i mean you dont just flick a switch
28178,so this air hostess persons flying it eh well i wish her the best of luck
28179,i dont think so
28180,what i dont know
28181,cant be
28182,jettisoned
28183,handy little device the sonic screwdriver got me out of a lot of scrapes
28184,unscrew the hinges if you wouldnt mind
28185,well done nyssa thats the idea we make another zero room out of whats left
28186,and unlike the tardis it is very small
28187,oh just the zero cabinet
28188,you wont feel my weight ill make it easy for you ill be levitating
28189,so sorry lost concentration for a moment very tired
28190,please theres not much time thank you
28191,hmm twelve of them at least war party maybe
28192,doctor everyones looking for him
28193,thats the strangest thing of all im not entirely sure
28194,librarian books and stuff
28195,then you read you all read
28196,castrovalva yes the place to rest
28197,definitely civilisation
28198,the hunt yes its all coming back to me you werent at the hunt
28199,i suppose thats why they made you librarian
28200,reaching down the books from the top shelf
28201,youre a doctor
28202,not the doctor i suppose i came here to find him i think
28203,the portreeve a sort of magistrate
28204,yes good night
28205,youre the portreeve
28206,yes that is good
28207,you overheard
28208,oh
28209,yes it has been a long journey tell me portreeve off the record will i find the doctor here
28210,good
28211,good night
28212,nyssa lovely morning im beginning to feel quite my old self or rather my new self
28213,i like your castrovalva portreeve very clever of them to have brought me here
28214,oh the ogrons and the daleks and that no no i think it does us good to be reminded the universe isnt entirely peopled with nasty creatures out for themselves
28215,whoever did this certainly has a way with needle and thread
28216,this device you mentioned
28217,fascinating demonstration portreeve how often do the pictures renew themselves
28218,some form of fast particle projection i suppose
28219,indeed
28220,you know i had no idea i was putting them to so much trouble its a very long way for three young people to carry me
28221,yes er tegan nyssa and er tegan no thats silly er nyssa tegan and nyssa nyssa tegan you know im sure theres someone missing
28222,one two good day one two no no no no
28223,what
28224,do you know thats exactly what i thought
28225,stop please youre making me dizzy well have to give you a badge for mathematical excellence  adric adric
28226,no time for that where is he
28227,adric
28228,adric told you
28229,please never mind about the apologies i think its time i heard all about this
28230,the tardis
28231,we cant go through all that again
28232,well well just have to hope wont we
28233,never mind come on
28234,sorry no time must dash come back later where does this lead
28235,thank you    out onto a set of stairs that leads to the balcony overlooking the plaza town planning by maurits cornelis escher he made a lithograph called castrovalva in 1930 a hrefhttp
28236,shush concentrate this could be serious
28237,very like it quick there may still be time to reverse the sense         shardovan
28238,castrovalva folding in on itself deliberately
28239,recursive occlusion someones manipulating castrovalva were caught in a spacetime trap
28240,be careful if im right the occlusion wont be dangerous to you at this moment youre only trouble will be finding the way quickly
28241,must be about five hundred years old
28242,well done margrave
28243,you know im very fond of history but i dont usually get much time for reading
28244,precisely what im trying to find out tell me mergrave what do you see out of the window
28245,and it all makes sense to you
28246,shardovan
28247,how do i know youre telling the truth
28248,a perfect example of recursion mergrave and recursion is exactly what were up against draw me a square large as you can
28249,now the library the square the portreeves house now wheres your pharmacy
28250,four pharmacies in a small place like this
28251,you positioned it four times
28252,hmm
28253,not as well as you but im afraid one of us is deluded about geography
28254,well thats castrovalva not ruther i suppose you know the whereabouts of the portreeves house
28255,well put show us on the map
28256,there is something amiss with castrovalva but because your perception is part of it you cannot see it
28257,yes well im afraid that would take some doing
28258,yes yes in a minute this library of shardovans are all the books like this
28259,these volumes chronicle the rise of castrovalva out of an alliance of warring hunters twelve hundred years ago or purport to chronicle
28260,yes well im no expert but i have the strongest possible hunch that these are forgeries
28261,oh the threads the bindings the paper are as near the real thing as may be but the contents are faked
28262,there is something were all overlooking
28263,i dont know im overlooking it too
28264,if there ever was a real history
28265,shardovan i thought as much i must see the portreeve
28266,one little suggestion
28267,youre the man i want
28268,youre the only man here who could not be persuaded to join the hunting ritual
28269,your intelligence would not permit it you suspected the whole tradition was invention from beginning to end and heres the proof your annotations of the histories
28270,hmm the fiction of castrovalva a civilisation evolving out of tribal warfare into an ideal community it is a fiction and the thing that confirms it
28271,oh i know it its on the tip its on the tip of my mind the books are five hundred years old at least but
28272,but you do see it the spatial anomaly
28273,we must be very close to whatever hes using to power all this come on well have to hurry youre a good tall chap
28274,shush
28275,listen carefully this man you know as portreeve is the most evil force in the universe you have got to help me defeat him got to do you understand
28276,well say something please
28277,yes would be best
28278,i know i know stay back
28279,deadly you mean
28280,all right master its me you want let the boy go
28281,there was no call for that
28282,unless you let every one of them go now
28283,shardovan get back
28284,he gave his life to help us
28285,so must we without the web to support it the local space will fold up into itself come on
28286,it still makes sense to mergrave stay behind him
28287,the square again
28288,it couldnt take off space is squeezing in too fast
28289,it cant collapse without causing a breach somewhere
28290,adric created it which way
28291,anything you dont recognise as castrovalva
28292,follow adric hold on to each other
28293,mergrave  master
28294,mergrave we have got to leave
28295,lets hope so
28296,got to be fit to crew the tardis trim time ship and a shipshape team
28297,you flew the tardis
28298,there arent any
28299,it was a projection
28300,adric preprogrammed it whatever you did to the console wed have ended up at castrovalva
28301,the master leaves nothing to chance
28302,oh i think so in fact i feel quite like my old self well
28303,well whoever i feel like its absolutely splendid lets go   ltback to the episode listing
28304,oh a bit ahead of schedule when was your flight again
28305,february the twenty eighth 1981 oh youll have time for a cup of tea its only sixteen fifteen hours
28306,last time i was there they were doing strange things to terminal three oh no youre right it doesnt
28307,oh adrics just showing off he means the milky way your galaxy ha massive magnetic field shift
28308,i suppose it could be part of the piccadilly line
28309,no no no wait wait wait the atmospheres wrong
28310,diminution of oxygen nitrogen traces of mercurial compound intense proton activity
28311,er im going to take a look around now none of you is to leave here is that clearly understood good
28312,well were in motion so we can be pretty sure its a spaceship
28313,patience
28314,and it appears to be unmanned adric through there space packs no need to bother with the visors
28315,theres a lot to interest you out there young lady highly advanced innovative stuff
28316,yes there appears to be nothing but machinery out there but we are under scrutiny theres a monopticon out there
28317,well i suppose it would be best described as a sort of mobile black eye with a hypnotic stare
28318,yes if you like stay here adric
28319,hello again you must be having a ball
28320,amazing work worthy of gallifrey noncorrosive alloys saturated polymers highly advanced
28321,yes an interferometer
28322,but we could use it on the time curve circuits
28323,belts and braces
28324,yes thats whats interesting see if you can get it going    monarch
28325,so your lips are sealed well would it be in order for you to take me to your leader if you have a leader that is
28326,oh well thats a friendly gesture thank you er perhaps one of us should stay with nyssa adric
28327,good man come on well see you both later
28328,here we are
28329,you look as if you might be
28330,enlightenment how do you do
28331,friendly i hope
28332,i am the doctor
28333,of everything
28334,a gallifreyan tegan is an earthling adric is an alzarian and nyssa there is from traken
28335,of course and inadvertently as a matter of fact
28336,thank you may i ask who you are
28337,goodness me you are a long way from home
28338,youre very kind
28339,you know i drop in from time to time myself and nothing on earth changes quite so often as the fashion you wouldnt believe the way some people look some of them even wear safety pins
28340,earrings
28341,yes a lot of it about
28342,drop in times
28343,yes i promised to put tegan on her plane
28344,yes in a sense they go from heathrow airport
28345,no not even the quarantine area
28346,an error my assistant miscalculated the coordinates
28347,or it could have been your dense magnetic field causing a fluctuation of my artron energy
28348,yes silly isnt it only my professor at the academy seemed to understand it just goes to show how academic everything is
28349,come on adric explain the formula
28350,come along children not in front of our hosts
28351,thank you monarch
28352,majesty
28353,im sure shes all right
28354,ah there you are thats reassuring
28355,hello im the doctor this is tegan adric and nyssa
28356,are you an earthling
28357,greek
28358,what are you doing here
28359,salt if youre an earthling how do you come to be on this ship
28360,you speak the dialect
28361,well i know that whats he saying
28362,whats he doing here
28363,sorry to interrupt
28364,the dreaming
28365,is that where youre going
28366,no of course youre not
28367,how do you do your highness
28368,who are her people
28369,goodness thats going back a bit   targetblank burt kwouk enters in quilted mandarin jacket to complete the cast
28370,greetings
28371,well id never have guessed it you look in the best of health to me
28372,youre all earthlings what are you doing on this ship are you hostages is that it
28373,no
28374,well thats very civil of his majesty who are you
28375,magical
28376,but you have
28377,well we must read your history books
28378,one couldnt wish for a more enchanting teacher
28379,enlightenment
28380,yes of course and you must be minister of persuasion
28381,may one ask the purpose of your journey to planet earth
28382,many of you
28383,yes well
28384,i see so weve accepted your invitation
28385,au revoir
28386,i hope were not putting you out
28387,youre with your family
28388,seems young for his age dont you think
28389,on the face of it
28390,oh i dont anticipate a great deal of difficulty
28391,i knew a sailor once friend of mine chap named drake
28392,he said something like theres time enough to get to terminal three and beat the armada too
28393,could there really be more than one of these
28394,if our conversation is to remain private yes
28395,she didnt talk of people she talked of population
28396,sloppy thinking adric do you know there are at least three billion bacteria in this chamber alone and if a frog with a funny head can turn itself into a semblance of a human being in a matter of minutes there isnt much of a limit to what it cant do to say nothing of the dressmaking
28397,i am beginning to wonder i mean here we are four days from earth on a spaceship with three billion and three frogs and four earthlings why wait a minute wait a minute how long is one hundred generations
28398,call it twenty five
28399,right right so its at least two thousand five hundred years since our hosts last visited earth when they rescued bigon now if the return journey to urbanka takes the same time as the journey to earth hows your ancient history tegan
28400,well not to worry mines pretty good now the futu dynasty in china i would put at four thousand years ago the mayans in south american flourished eight thousand years ago and kurkutji the aborigine says its so long since he was taken he cant remember how about twelve thousand years
28401,yes so you keep saying tegan is anyone saying youre wrong
28402,or maybe tegans right why do it
28403,no but his ancestor was wouldnt be the first time that whole generations have known of no other life than a spaceship
28404,im saying that the urbankans have visited earth four times and taken at least one cultural representative and this time theyre coming for good well i say good three billion earthlings plus three billion urbankans i really dont think so i really dont think so at all
28405,explore
28406,bring these
28407,hmm i get the feeling we were meant to lose them
28408,oh what do you suggest come on and try to keep calm well get nowhere if you lose your head
28409,more earthlings hello some sort of entertainment
28410,thank you
28411,im afraid theyve got lost you know what children are
28412,how is urbanka represented
28413,no no no no as percy over there said they cant be far
28414,why should they
28415,nonsense wouldnt make any sense
28416,well take the advice of a mad man and look happy
28417,try to look as if youre enjoying yourself in these situations its the best form of defence and it gives me time to think      enlightenment
28418,i fancy ive made our quarters private enough
28419,ill do my best
28420,act up to me
28421,quite all right thank you just a dizzy spell must be the altitude
28422,a little diversion i think were on to something bigon wants to talk to me
28423,four visits every four thousand years or so
28424,how can organic life endure that long
28425,incredible engineering
28426,exactly just three silicon chips
28427,oh a thousand millionth of a metre
28428,well like it or not tegan youre looking at a fact if not a fact of life this ship contains the entire population of urbanka nine billion silicon chips
28429,so the aborigine the chinaman and the mayan are
28430,so it would seem as long as you have spare parts you could go on forever
28431,of course thats it hes after the silicon
28432,one of the biggest components of the earths crust is silicon all the chips he wants
28433,oh yes carbon too
28434,i thought he said urbankas son was a supernova
28435,and all this for what
28436,what
28437,absurd so he believes that to travel faster than light would mean going backwards in time back to the big bang
28438,if you feel this way why have you not acted before
28439,well the only course of action i can think of is to go along with him appear to cooperate
28440,its all right its all right just leave everything to me
28441,could you perhaps show me the part of the ship that controls the population all the information you can
28442,just keep calm
28443,not yet please will you stop thinking of yourself for once
28444,of what wholl believe us well be laughed at
28445,yes another way
28446,yes just coming now stay here youll be perfectly safe i wont be very long
28447,yes you will in here you cant be seen out there you can you stay here  go a little in front of me that will tell them not to confront me and i can surprise it
28448,shush
28449,yes and thats the way well deal with them all come on
28450,is the course controlled from here
28451,what are these doing
28452,intensified ultraviolet for photosynthesis
28453,and now its a source of oxygen
28454,point taken
28455,there were others
28456,and the frogs
28457,an appalling thought
28458,its a tall order
28459,nyssa wake up
28460,are you all right
28461,yes the devils wheres adric
28462,oh do they
28463,could we expect support from the others kurkutji and futu
28464,yes difficult to resist
28465,is there nowhere we could hide ourselves to get a plan together
28466,no weapons
28467,then our only hope is to get to the tardis and warn earth might these be of any use to us
28468,what for
28469,yes
28470,oh good grief
28471,ah yes i        monarch
28472,i think i will yes
28473,eye glass im a bit shortsighted in this one
28474,its a piece of string
28475,its a cricket ball a memento i used to bowl a very good chinaman
28476,i cant think why
28477,oh is it usual for a host to kill a guest
28478,my actions were motivated by scientific curiosity
28479,reports can be garbled your majesty
28480,i wouldnt dream of interfering with your monopticons
28481,thank you your majesty
28482,i know i know and thats what im sorry about you know i think i may have been entirely mistaken about monarch
28483,all great leaders have to be ruthless its the intention the mission      doctor
28484,now listen to me you young idiot youre not so much gullible as idealistic i suppose it comes from your deprived delinquent background monarch is the greatest being in the known universe for evil he will destroy earth and much more if hes not stopped
28485,yes back there he could hear us here he cant im playing for time
28486,do you want to save nyssa
28487,then shut up and listen he is not concerned with bringing civilisation he has the greatest contempt for anyone but himself he wants to rob earth of its minerals in order to travel faster than the speed of light
28488,its stored in the mobiliary if his mission is peaceful why does he want the poison
28489,do you really think that
28490,because he doesnt want to upset you yet
28491,look he wants to use you his subjects are all synthetic you are flesh and blood if you speak up for him on earth you can delay their opposition
28492,no you dont do you look the urbankans are synthetic they are not like you and me however sophisticated their circuitry they are still machines with me
28493,well make up your mind we havent much time
28494,i havent the slightest intention of telling you until i know if youre with me
28495,i dont believe it
28496,thats good with any luck they havent put this one right yet
28497,get some allies this door leads to the mobiliary nyssas in here now with this  i can distract the monopticon without disabling it it wont scan us but neither will it draw attention to us be ready to take over from me when we get inside
28498,saving your life i hope
28499,no no hear me out you are in great danger
28500,you must know all i say is true put them back bigon must have them back
28501,you must lin futu you are a very old and wise man you have been promised leadership of your people on earth
28502,do you think for one moment that monarch will honour that the chinese are the most populous and powerful race on earth once monarch grasps that what hope is there for you
28503,leave that to me will your dragon dance be included in the recreational
28504,then let it be next
28505,wake up nyssa nyssa nyssa
28506,what about the princess and kurkutji
28507,well somehow i must get to the tardis there are hatches i must try to get to it on a lifeline
28508,oh no no no that wont do for the temperature out there and anyway ill need your help
28509,splendid adric i can use this  but we have only six minutes thats as long as i can stand subzero temperatures
28510,what about the androids have you control of them all
28511,well is there no way to break the contact
28512,no theres no time anyway youd be seen
28513,can you arrange a collective activity
28514,youre spoiling my concentration come on old girl just dont let me down now dont let me down now
28515,rescuing nyssa and adric look just do what i say and do it quickly
28516,ah had the feeling he might
28517,save your breath you two put these on and you adric have you another helmet
28518,well assemble it quickly
28519,i can go into a trance which reduces the need for oxygen ah
28520,thank you bigon
28521,can you change the course of this ship
28522,urbanka
28523,id go home if i were you    doctor
28524,well come on come on im taking you back to earth
28525,oh its quite all right he needs the atmosphere as much as we do
28526,partly anyway the poison only works on organic matter
28527,you know i had my doubts about anyone who wants to go backwards in time by travelling faster than the speed of light its impossible fallacy of flesh time
28528,yes all right  are you coming
28529,good luck
28530,heathrow here we come
28531,hmm nearly there
28532,oh just mild mental disorientation nothing that forty eight hours of induced dsleep wont cure
28533,yes of course theres no need to shout come along nyssa
28534,well done adric its functioning as a delta waveform generator
28535,why should we need it
28536,there you are tegan theres always something to look at if you open your eyes
28537,good question any ideas
28538,adric dont wander off not on a new planet so tegan the question is who built it and what is it for
28539,of course to build this to achieve the delicate resonances involved would require a high level of technical skill and yet look around you no signs of civilisation no cultivation no roadways even and yet whoever built this must have a musical sense not unlike not entirely unlike our own are you sure youre all right
28540,must be the fresh air its very puzzling dont you think    adric
28541,whatever it is it could be distinctly unfriendly look at it
28542,hmm its obviously an armoured suit of some kind i would say its occupant was probably human in shape
28543,or she or
28544,adric
28545,there is a difference between serious scientific investigation and meddling
28546,isnt there
28547,thats better
28548,intentions unknown hypothesis unfriendly as k9 would say
28549,roberts was roberts
28550,id be very pleased to its a little difficult to concentrate
28551,well im afraid we cant help you the er thing was empty when we came across it
28552,s14
28553,the kinda are the native lifeform
28554,who built the chimes
28555,could you repeat the question
28556,just passing through look i dont suppose theres a chance of some breakfast are you hungry adric adric he usually is boys you know if you could oblige look if we turn out to be hostile then fair enough until we do why not give us the benefit of the doubt its commonsense really dont you think
28557,the ilf
28558,the kinda
28559,ah no no i dont seem to be very er these difficulties you referred to
28560,roberts
28561,what do you think the kinda took them
28562,are the kinda dangerous
28563,used to
28564,the hostages
28565,could i see them
28566,ive a friend still in the forest im quite concerned for her safety id like to know how much of a threat the kinda are
28567,hmm complete lack of neuromuscular reaction theyre not sulking shock wouldnt you think in the circumstances your arrival here must have come as something of a surprise and then to lock them up
28568,oh illogical please let me out of here have you any idea of the affect upon a primitive mind
28569,well it could be the double helix
28570,thank you what could they know of molecular biology
28571,which means the kinda have no need of shelter and no fears for food supply
28572,what
28573,i thought the native produce was forbidden
28574,yes
28575,what
28576,theres a kinda out there now
28577,he doesnt look as if hes living in paradise
28578,what are your plans for this planet
28579,oh well of course if hindle would have a fit
28580,an apple a day keeps the er no never mind
28581,i dont think thats
28582,nothing
28583,can i come with you
28584,im quite concerned about my friend tegan
28585,that may not be enough
28586,hes not altogether stable in fact i think hes on the verge of a nervous breakdown
28587,well er logically that one
28588,well now logic would dictate that one  but wait no ill try and second guess you that one
28589,no no no quite impossible that would be in direct contradiction to the laws of the material universe
28590,oh er well that one that one
28591,should we
28592,how
28593,choose
28594,go on
28595,youre sure
28596,not the other one
28597,yes
28598,shush    hindle
28599,rather what
28600,oh
28601,oh dear
28602,well perhaps it might
28603,well you dont have to
28604,and then
28605,what are you defending the dome against
28606,oh i see
28607,well perhaps if we could define the exact nature of the threat posed by the trees
28608,yes but
28609,nearly nearly nearly i thought that the kinda
28610,of
28611,why do you think the plants are hostile
28612,adric
28613,i dont know
28614,id like to know what hes up to
28615,oh good that is good news isnt it if in doubt then fire and acid every time dont you think
28616,ravenous
28617,what
28618,oh i see a little game yes er that one      doctor
28619,look its only a game
28620,dont hurt him
28621,dont
28622,i think your guess was right the kinda are telepathic
28623,i dont know ive tried to communicate with them myself but i cant get through
28624,look i have a suggestion
28625,well i was simply going to suggest that you banished him from the dome left him at the mercy of the trees
28626,oh yes i was forgetting
28627,hes the first to return isnt he
28628,good then we may find out what happened to the others
28629,well there may be another reason
28630,something more hostile out there
28631,well now if the kinda are more sophisticated than they first appear is it not possible that their enemies are also
28632,hmm
28633,not half so much as hindle frightens me
28634,by whom
28635,yes i know sanders do you know whats in the box
28636,unfortunately so could he
28637,well weve established one thing
28638,the kinda have a sense of humour  hindle
28639,i think its safe to assume we all three had the same experience how do you feel
28640,not different
28641,somehow the box linked us up with the kinda we were seeing the world through their eyes
28642,yes its shock hell be all right come on
28643,you were right this is no planet of primitives and the answers out there in the forest come on leave the box
28644,well jump
28645,has anyone ever told you you ask a lot of questions
28646,yes so you are
28647,er that way
28648,come on
28649,yes
28650,were lost
28651,well i thought the cave in the dream
28652,oh absolutely
28653,tell you what toss for it heads this way tails that  heads
28654,heads  he follows her
28655,nonsense
28656,look
28657,culturally nonhostile didnt you say
28658,er well i dont really see what i could er wait a minute
28659,i thought you said the kinda had no voice
28660,well he certainly seems to
28661,its the girl from the dream
28662,the prophecy
28663,gladly
28664,where are we going i expect you know these woods backwards eh well i dont suppose youve come across a young woman
28665,yes thats her tegan
28666,now where is she
28667,well is that far
28668,come on
28669,you said hed been sick
28670,yes but now he can speak he has voice
28671,yes but so do you
28672,panna
28673,is he how many do you have
28674,seven
28675,isnt that rather extravagant
28676,well on the whole one
28677,yes
28678,such stuff as dreams are made of
28679,hello
28680,yes most enlightening
28681,well i suppose i must be i have been called one many
28682,yes
28683,what is
28684,you said once again
28685,and i suppose this happens many times
28686,yes thats right
28687,what do you know of the mara
28688,i too have heard the legends of the mara
28689,we must do as she says
28690,look
28691,you heard panna this is the beginning and the end
28692,we cant
28693,did you recognise the laugh
28694,no the mara within him
28695,in a manner of speaking
28696,both and now we must get back to the dome stop the attack
28697,well the old woman must direct us
28698,what
28699,in certain states of deep trance the bodily functions slow down to such an extent that they are barely perceptible thus freeing the mind to such as we have seen however on this occasion it seems
28700,pannas dead
28701,well unlikely perhaps
28702,er well its a good scientific question where are you
28703,both of you
28704,so when panna died her knowledge and experience were passed over to you
28705,well did you see it
28706,well so did i
28707,unless we stop the attack on the dome
28708,and somehow one of them has crossed over into this world and has taken over the mind of aris one thing puzzles me
28709,how did it cross over
28710,which is
28711,of course tegan
28712,tegan
28713,what is the function of the chimes
28714,share share what minds
28715,what would happen if one person dreamt here alone
28716,then i have to wake her
28717,i have to take that risk tegan tegan
28718,are you all right
28719,dream
28720,what dream
28721,now come on tegan you must tell me
28722,youve been asleep for nearly two days
28723,oh not now tegan please theres no time you must tell me about the dream its very important
28724,yes of course the other man standing there laughing go on
28725,what a snake
28726,well was it
28727,good go on
28728,you werent yourself
28729,aris
28730,dont be silly tegan it cant have been come on what did you do
28731,no of course you werent
28732,isnt it obvious your mind and body were occupied the mara who found its path to this world through your dream just as karuna said
28733,oh its all right youre perfectly safe now in fact ill introduce you
28734,theyre about to attack the dome
28735,come on
28736,i have an idea its controller is rather inexperienced
28737,adric stop listen to me this is the doctor
28738,are you all right
28739,look after adric
28740,have you oh good theres nothing quite like it is there
28741,what is it
28742,yes of course
28743,and the security arrangements
28744,no no no id rather know how you control the kinda
28745,mirrors yes very clever
28746,yes may
28747,im so sorry
28748,when i what
28749,deactivated all quite harmless now
28750,he now appears to see the situation in quite a different light
28751,he opened the box
28752,the box of jhana the box sanders was given by the kinda
28753,yes
28754,the box is a powerful kinda healing device i suspect it generates sound at a frequency beyond our ears
28755,helps bring the mind back into phase
28756,with everything with life out there the kinda are very sophisticated people
28757,oh yes the more the mind is out of phase to begin with the more dramatic the apparent effect
28758,ill explain everything in greater detail later
28759,escaped
28760,well we must find him quickly before hes destroyed by the mara within him
28761,i dont know yet
28762,what oh the mirror they thought hed captured their ah
28763,i dont suppose youve come across any large mirrors in your wanderings about the dome silly question really
28764,well reflective surfaces of any kind come on quickly think
28765,where
28766,show me
28767,what is the one thing evil cannot face not ever
28768,itself
28769,ah hindle captured their innocence the mara will rebel they cannot face themselves dont you see
28770,good adric tegan hes coming
28771,well according to the legends
28772,no mara can bear the sight of its own reflection it must recoil from itself understandably dont you think given its nature
28773,very well then trapped in a circle of mirrors each mirror reflecting not only the mara itself but also
28774,in an endless series
28775,exactly
28776,it retreats back to where it came from
28777,or wherever but not here thats the main thing its all quite logical
28778,well tegan survived but
28779,well it would do no harm would it to keep ones fingers crossed
28780,ah there you are we thought youd got lost
28781,im called the doctor
28782,because i share the kindas aim where youre concerned
28783,well you did for a while but no longer
28784,yes so i hear but it is the voice of a mara in the body of aris the snake on your arm the symbol of your power confirms it
28785,oh youre too late now
28786,the mara is detaching itself
28787,its leaving aris it has no further use for him
28788,tegan tegan tegan are you all right
28789,close these gaps
28790,yes
28791,yes
28792,its all right its all right stand firm look its starting to weaken look
28793,who can tell
28794,back to the dark places of the inside or wherever but not here not anywhere here this world is free of it
28795,come on its finished
28796,is it decided
28797,which is
28798,is he
28799,oh hell be all right he was just driven out of his mind just what he needed what about you will you stay
28800,youre not tempted by paradise
28801,ah yes one moment
28802,oh no that would be completely impossible wouldnt it
28803,if not ridiculous
28804,yes it seems some people are getting impatient
28805,goodbye
28806,nyssa how are you
28807,excellent
28808,oh nothing much this and that having fun
28809,i dont see why not
28810,how many times have i told you adric not to interfere with with things that you dont understand
28811,in the tss you were lucky you didnt destroy the whole kinda tribe
28812,that isnt the point you should never have got into that unit
28813,apart from aris
28814,try to understand adric because you get away with something it doesnt justify it
28815,next time you want to escape from somewhere walk
28816,is tegan ready
28817,a fault
28818,must be the lateral balance cones again you know i must do some maintenance after weve delivered tegan
28819,now dont jump to conclusions adric sometimes we humanoids try to disguise our our true feelings well dont just stand there adric help me
28820,not one of the most stimulating places in the universe but nevertheless where requested to be
28821,oh no
28822,hmm yes a small error has been made
28823,its probably due to nothing more than a temperamental solenoid on the lateral balance cones
28824,and as you know the tardis isnt always
28825,why does she always overreact
28826,then why didnt she say so rather than fly off the handle like that
28827,no no no too much has been said already earthlings
28828,and ill keep it consider this a fortuitous mistake it isnt everyone who gets the chance to wander round their own history
28829,what i suppose it does a bit
28830,sulphur
28831,wrong time and place for that
28832,undoubtedly when we find the person whos burning the sulphur perhaps youll believe him
28833,probably not
28834,theres potassium nitrate in with the sulphur
28835,potassium nitrate and sulphur are constituents of a primitive explosive gunpowder
28836,this time i agree
28837,come on come on this way
28838,can you help us
28839,lead on sir
28840,why were those men following us
28841,well were new to the area
28842,of course the reason for the sulphuric smoke purification fires
28843,hence the guns
28844,how bad is the plague
28845,why
28846,theyre not due for a comet for years
28847,interesting and so is the ornament around your neck
28848,yes not yet may i see
28849,hmm interesting piece of work what do you think
28850,yes
28851,do you mind if i have a look around your loft
28852,fit for a climb adric
28853,part of an alien bracelet made for a very special purpose
28854,oh make your own guess a comet when there shouldnt have been a comet a meteor that doesnt look like a meteor whatever the phenomenon was it certainly wasnt natural
28855,or burning up in the atmosphere
28856,ah not necessarily the bracelet is strong enough to have survived the crash however if we find something more fragile
28857,correct
28858,of course ive met kings emperors megalomaniacs in my time
28859,im calling on the master of the house not his servants
28860,you knock while i look around
28861,just nyssa if anyone opens the door call me
28862,perhaps we should find out that window doesnt look fastened properly
28863,no not yet lets see whos at home first hello
28864,well im not for all i know they went to the village
28865,indeed so the sooner we find out the sooner we can return tegan to her own time anyone at home
28866,no not really polygrite is found in many parts of the universe so are power packs
28867,well if im right the comet that actor saw was their ship burning up in the atmosphere theyre probably stranded here desperate they could wreak havoc
28868,oh twist their arms a bit to let me take them back to their own planet
28869,ill find something
28870,gunpowder someones been careless
28871,so they have been here
28872,youre beginning to sound like tegan
28873,look
28874,and fired from a weapon
28875,hold this
28876,well you only build a staircase to lead somewhere
28877,why should anyone want to build a wall here
28878,well this should be a very important staircase logically it should lead from the main hall to the kitchens
28879,no theres something wrong i can feel it
28880,ah
28881,yes
28882,it is isnt it
28883,very simple i found the door
28884,its there all the same i knew there was something peculiar about this wall
28885,right i picked the lock
28886,camouflage as you pass through it it opens around you
28887,i must speak to the people who invented it
28888,not yet
28889,soliton gas
28890,well someone who needs it to breathe properly lets find them
28891,so
28892,theyre near
28893,you said you wanted wine help yourself
28894,just dont disturb anything
28895,the regulator isnt pulsing properly
28896,oh well perhaps theyre just for research
28897,no dont
28898,just get out of here
28899,now i dont know if you can understand me but i would like to point out how volatile soliton is when mixed freely with oxygen
28900,thats what youre supposed to think
28901,an android a mechanical man a machine
28902,oh it takes more than a pair of flintlocks to damage an android
28903,no but i dont know how badly hurt she is where are you going
28904,i came up here to get you
28905,adric and tegan are hurt i need your help to get them out
28906,like this
28907,well
28908,why are earth people so parochial
28909,come on nyssa lets go
28910,well theres nothing we can do now until weve dealt with the android
28911,no well er well try modifying the sonic booster in the tardis if we connect it to a frequency accelerator
28912,well we may just get a high enough pitch to vibrate the android to pieces
28913,very
28914,i have no intention of doing so now if youve quite finished lecturing me i suggest we go back to the tardis and get started
28915,were wasting time nyssa
28916,come on
28917,no one here
28918,most of the hardware is up at the house i should think
28919,an escape pod a sort of life boat only from a ship that flies
28920,thats right
28921,because it buried itself on impact
28922,vintaric crystals quite a common form of lighting
28923,the lights you saw in the sky a few weeks ago were the main part of the ship burning up in the atmosphere
28924,the presence of the pod confirms it
28925,ah that would be rather difficult to explain
28926,which is more than you can say for the owners of this ship
28927,i wonder how many terileptils this pod could carry
28928,yes terileptils build those things too well
28929,it has to the androids are programmed to protect the only way around them is to destroy them before they destroy you
28930,well it obviously wanted prisoners we cant rely on it remaining so benign
28931,yes a refresher course in android design might help as well
28932,i too have a ship of sorts it isnt the most reliable of machines but its aged memory banks might contain something of use
28933,are you beginning to believe that im telling the truth
28934,lets see if the coast is clear
28935,i see it
28936,the bracelet overrides fear unless youre prepared to use them theyre quite useless
28937,go back to the pod
28938,i am indeed how do you do
28939,another time perhaps
28940,there are three at the moment fire those we could have a dozen to contend with
28941,our friendly neighbourhood axe man
28942,he might get lucky could hit an opening mechanism on the other side hang on
28943,get down
28944,well you cant rest yet
28945,the miller of course why didnt i think of that
28946,oh its him im interested in not his horse he comes and goes from the house as he pleases maybe he can help us why dont you go back to the tardis and start work on the booster while we look for him
28947,well youre more than capable
28948,and ill be back as quickly as i can
28949,now then which way to the mill
28950,just direct me then you can wait here for the poacher and his friend
28951,hello
28952,were here to see the miller
28953,ah good day im the doctor you must be the miller
28954,no no let him go
28955,nothing in there lets get back to the tardis help nyssa
28956,at once
28957,we havent got the plague i can help you wait listen
28958,not again
28959,thank you im the doctor i can help
28960,the headman was wearing a bracelet
28961,yeah for the terileptils
28962,not as their prisoner
28963,it might be more subtle
28964,well youd better snatch it back again quickly the headmans coming i want to get his bracelet off
28965,we have no choice free of it we might be able to reason with him
28966,yes yes of course of course but first i would like to thank you very much for saving our lives
28967,it was worth a try
28968,oh dear how is he
28969,hell be all right
28970,there must be some way out of here adric and tegan are depending on me
28971,here let me try
28972,tegan
28973,concentrate tegan you can override the effects concentrate hard get back to the tardis and tell nyssa whats happening
28974,i dont think youll have seen anything quite like a terileptil before
28975,sorry its just im quite concerned about a couple of friends i left here ive already seen tegan but id like to know that the boy adric is
28976,well thats unfortunate because we had intended to help you
28977,to get back to your own planet yes
28978,not at all
28979,so youve been to prison what does that matter
28980,theres only one place in the universe a terileptil can acquire such scaring the tinclavic mines on raaga
28981,terileptian law was never my strong point
28982,i see your point but there are countless uninhabited planets you could settle on
28983,youre highly intelligent you have your android your skills your way of life wouldnt remain primitive for long
28984,i can take you anywhere you want a billion light years from your home planet youd never be found
28985,i cant let you do that
28986,the tardis is a very temperamental machine needing very careful handling
28987,you didnt take very good care of your own ship
28988,i gather its breakup made an impressive spectacle
28989,there are only four of you
28990,against the millions who already live on this planet youd never establish yourself here
28991,genocide
28992,youll find their annihilation more difficult than you think and the tardis will not help you
28993,ahem
28994,he is one untrained man what will you do when they send thousands of their soldiers against you
28995,a neat idea dressing the android up as death
28996,yes
28997,tell me what happened to the occupants of this house
28998,ive never been able to reconcile the terileptils love of art and beauty with their love of war dont i qualify for a bracelet
28999,cruder but more effective hey
29000,oh i know but by your admission these people are still primitive whats your excuse
29001,oh for a proper key
29002,someday i must get a proper survival kit together
29003,it isnt my day is it
29004,why not smile and let me live
29005,you overestimate me
29006,the poor old black rat and his flea
29007,but youd need thousands of them
29008,i thought the local plague was already doing that
29009,then who will serve you
29010,this carnage isnt necessary
29011,thats hardly an argument
29012,tegan i know you never listen to a word i say but please put the cover back on the cage you can do it just concentrate and you can override the control think hard cover the cage
29013,steady youll be all right
29014,im the doctor take it easy
29015,oh almost your old self
29016,its more likely the electrical charge i gave him so what am i to do about these
29017,will this be any good
29018,open the cage and find out
29019,oh yes
29020,the terileptils find it disturbingly easy to justify themselves how are you doing with that lock
29021,er just a moment more
29022,youre right stand back
29023,i said stand back
29024,i never miss
29025,try the door
29026,the master control is overriding the switch stack some of these empty boxes up along here
29027,just stunned
29028,a nearby city which is the nearest city
29029,have a look around see what papers you can find
29030,will you just look around there might be something
29031,you wouldnt
29032,or terileptian script you know i didnt realise their technology was so advanced
29033,what oh yes
29034,it doesnt matter
29035,the control panel ive disconnected it
29036,oh well find it
29037,lets get back to the tardis
29038,sos this
29039,if you abandoned some of that junk you might
29040,its stuck
29041,its been sealed well have to find the back door
29042,help if were lucky
29043,i dont know
29044,it may be the only glimpse you ever get of my tardis
29045,so you got here at last
29046,i like long walks
29047,well i knew the booster would work in theory but practice is another matter
29048,ah in search of our terileptil
29049,yes yes thats why im searching
29050,wait and see
29051,the terileptil base
29052,its an electrical emission from a piece of scientific equipment not something youd expect to find in seventeenth century earth
29053,because i wasnt looking for it until i found it
29054,when a millers cart stands outside a bakery it isnt hard to deduce where the miller is
29055,good evening
29056,you were expecting me
29057,i brought the android as well
29058,the guns about to explode
29059,we must go our presence here would raise too many awkward questions can we drop you anywhere
29060,into the tardis
29061,oh a keepsake
29062,good luck
29063,i have a sneaking suspicion this fire should be allowed to run its course
29064,ill explain someday    ltback to the episode listing
29065,i have
29066,whats the matter old girl why this compulsion for planet earth
29067,a railway station
29068,three oclock june the 11th 1925
29069,its interesting isnt it and no jet lag shall we go outside
29070,oh that would have happened if wed been there or not all part of earths history
29071,come on
29072,you think so as a boy i always wanted to drive one
29073,why not
29074,this is nyssa
29075,and adric and tegan
29076,ah i regret i have none
29077,smutty
29078,er no as a matter of fact
29079,not bad
29080,fast
29081,middle stump
29082,howzat
29083,howzat
29084,how do you do
29085,the master
29086,yes of course
29087,thank you
29088,well certainly a cold drink
29089,great scott
29090,well i do have a terrible thirst perhaps a lemonade with lots of ice
29091,well its very charming of you to make us so welcome
29092,thank you
29093,it certainly is what are you going to wear
29094,adric
29095,er not quite hes alzarian
29096,yes
29097,whos that
29098,why do i always let my curiosity get the better of me
29099,hello
29100,lady cranleigh
29101,how do you do
29102,im afraid im lost
29103,i should explain
29104,oh but there is you see in my meanderings ive come across something rather unpleasant
29105,theres a body through there
29106,a dead man in a cupboard

29123,miss talbot is quite mistaken i have just come down these stairs before that i was wait a minute was i like this
29124,well thats it then
29125,a completely logical explanation a duplication of fancy dress someone else must be wearing an identical costume
29126,and only one murderer lady cranleigh i agreed to keep it from your guests but i have the distinct feeling im in rather hot water
29127,why
29128,why would i attack you have you done me any harm
29129,no then ive no reason to harm you and besides
29130,well it wouldnt be cricket
29131,no of course not
29132,thats a very difficult question

29134,im afraid if i told you you wouldnt believe me
29135,im a time lord
29136,i told you
29137,i travel in time and space i have a time machine youve read h g wells
29138,lady cranleigh please help me
29139,theres something terribly wrong here lady cranleigh knows i showed her another dead body
29140,i showed you a body in a cupboard up there you and the indian

29146,im not imagining all this
29147,lady cranleigh i appeal to you it was you who introduced me to this man
29148,no the indian
29149,yes his name was ditoni or something like that you said he was a friend from brazil

29152,thats very kind of you
29153,accomplices
29154,thank you lady cranleigh for a delightfully unexpected afternoon
29155,sergeant do we pass the station
29156,i mean the railway station
29157,would you stop there a moment
29158,theres vital evidence that will prove what im saying is true
29159,stop and ill show you
29160,its not here
29161,what i wanted to show you
29162,this one will
29163,please
29164,in this sense
29165,come in
29166,the man in the cupboard
29167,i could get you there sooner
29168,the stairs are burning
29169,tell him lady cranleigh and why hes so interested in ann
29170,the black orchid for one latoni for another
29171,ill leave lady cranleigh to do that i have to rescue nyssa

29173,try and hold his attention here ill find a way up through the house
29174,george that isnt ann ann is down there look
29175,thank you i shall treasure it    ltback to the episode listing
29176,you must read this adric the black orchid
29177,its fascinating such scholarship
29178,whats the matter
29179,why
29180,oh no one thinks that
29181,well everyones teased from time to time
29182,thats not true
29183,time we have spent many hours discussing and debating endless topics
29184,all right ill make more time
29185,i give you my word
29186,thats not fair
29187,have you quite finished
29188,well it can wait
29189,the tardis is not designed for espace nyssa tell him
29190,he wants to go home
29191,and that would involve the tardis going back into espace
29192,how do you calculate negative coordinates
29193,it would also involve passing through the cve now you cant calculate random coordinates
29194,you do not have the monitors skill adric and even if you did i am not going back into espace
29195,espace is another universe there isnt a taxi service goes back and forth
29196,do you really think id be making all this fuss if it werent
29197,oh help yourself im not waiting around while you plot the course to your own destruction
29198,earth
29199,twenty sixth century
29200,thank you
29201,why not adric wants to use the computer i want to go for a walk
29202,you see
29203,im going outside now i might be gone some time
29204,so peaceful and cool down here
29205,all right but im not taking him back into espace and thats my final word on the matter
29206,all right ill look but im not promising anything
29207,now look here adric
29208,what
29209,phosphorescence
29210,hmm
29211,an amazing species
29212,you should be proud if they were
29213,they were also the most successful creature ever to inhabit the earth
29214,fossilised remains have been found all over the planet not bad adaptation for a creature with a brain the size of a pea
29215,hundred million years or so they seemed so secure and yet they died out virtually overnight
29216,initially hypothermia then starvation
29217,something equally as devastating the earth collided with something from space
29218,could be i dont know ive always meant to slip back and find out       snyder
29219,its size it was gigantic
29220,the impact would have caused millions upon millions of tons of earth and rock to be fragmented and then hurled up into the atmosphere enveloping the whole planet
29221,to such an extent that the surface temperature would have dropped radically
29222,sixty five million years
29223,primitive tegan very primitive
29224,er i dont think we should go any further
29225,how do you do im the doctor this is tegan and nyssa
29226,what are we supposed to have done
29227,anything we can do
29228,what bodies
29229,weve only just arrived
29230,i know nothing about it
29231,i cant
29232,nyssa
29233,androids thats why they didnt register on your scanners
29234,no if you want proof youll find theyll kill me as willingly as theyll kill you see what i mean
29235,do you know why
29236,whoevers controlling the android thinks there is
29237,yes they will but you must concentrate your fire
29238,no its only damaged
29239,undoubtedly
29240,waiting
29241,were you working near the rockfall the first time you were attacked
29242,well maybe their function is to protect that hatch
29243,lets find out
29244,oh theyre just like people
29245,which can be their weakness
29246,adric
29247,brave heart tegan now the androids are programmed to protect that hatch in order to carry out that duty successfully its important they remain operational
29248,well the androids now know we have the ability to inflict serious on them so if we attack that hatch we create a dilemma
29249,the conflict between duty and survival should cause enough confusion in their logic circuits for them to start making mistakes which is exactly what we want
29250,well lets find out
29251,well done
29252,its adric
29253,you think so
29254,lieutenant
29255,i think you should curtail the celebrations for the time being
29256,we must get this hatch open
29257,whoever built this hatch now knows weve destroyed its guardians
29258,ow your troopers got quite carried away didnt they i would suggest you get your people well back the hatch may be boobytrapped
29259,well my arms are only this long i cant get any further away
29260,no youd better get back too
29261,ah got it the release mechanism youd better get back too
29262,im not in the mood to argue
29263,further than that
29264,yes
29265,oh
29266,a bomb my opening the hatch has started up the arming procedure youd better let your people on the surface know whats happened
29267,ive no idea tegan get everyone into the tardis
29268,it was my own stupidity that started it off the least i can do is to of course come on
29269,the arming procedure on the bomb is being operated by remote control
29270,yes but not till i know where its coming from
29271,not long
29272,if they increase power they could break through
29273,enough
29274,to make life intolerable for the few who survived
29275,well there is somewhere we just dont have enough of the pieces yet
29276,laser cutter
29277,why you think they should have attacked earlier
29278,oh i dont think so the androids are programmed to protect this hatch now the cave system is enormous why draw attention to yourselves and your charge by attacking on the first day
29279,magnetic drone
29280,there was power in that circuit
29281,the signals breaking through
29282,i think drastic action is called for
29283,abandon methodical procedure for blind instinct laser cutter
29284,why a bomb and not a missile or some other device and why these particular caves theres a reason
29285,oh isnt it
29286,right the bomb is deactivated your own scientists can dismantle it good luck
29287,well thank you thank you but we must go still a great deal to do
29288,no there isnt time
29289,sector sixteen
29290,er no just from where their signal originated
29291,well im hoping that wont be necessary
29292,all right
29293,er adric
29294,do you have a moment
29295,look im very grateful for your help with deactivating the bomb
29296,it was very brave of you also the way you tackled the android
29297,hmm look ive been thinking about your wish to return home
29298,well i thought that if we could work out a satisfactory course i might give it a try
29299,really
29300,youve done extremely well
29301,look er im sorry about our argument earlier
29302,do you really want to go home
29303,so youve done all these calculations for nothing
29304,as near as ive been able to trace it
29305,and the crew entirely innocent of whats going on so well start with a recce
29306,youre sure
29307,oh i dont think it really matters    two crewmen enter one carrying a large box followed by the redoubtable
29308,theres no one about the ships totally automated
29309,a small one somewhere
29310,i want to announce my presence to see what the reaction is
29311,someone should have seen us by now
29312,minute or two more
29313,whats the matter
29314,were being followed
29315,over there
29316,theyre finished
29317,yes
29318,then make sure you kill the right people look at them
29319,look at the state theyre in
29320,look
29321,let me show you how we travelled here we have a ship of our own we dont need to be stowaways
29322,i assure you you have the wrong people
29323,how can we weve only just arrived on your ship
29324,every word
29325,oh i wouldnt dare
29326,you said yourself things have occurred you cant explain
29327,well the crewmen who disappeared may have discovered otherwise
29328,how often has this happened
29329,cant you isolate the power line
29330,well its the only way youll stop them
29331,i dont know but i have the feeling whatevers causing your power loss is out for considerable more than control of this ship
29332,your first officer is right you must listen to her
29333,the story about the bomb is true whoever planted it is now in your hold
29334,youve got clearance through to earth thats where they want to go youre giving them safe passage
29335,why a bomb and not some other device
29336,hmm we still dont know what theyre really after
29337,perhaps i could help
29338,about time
29339,definitely not
29340,cybermen
29341,far worse you must withdraw your men they dont stand a chance
29342,oh you havent seen anything wait until the cybermen start
29343,oh yes we go back a long way
29344,its the cybermens way
29345,i bet it isnt in gold
29346,cybermen are rather allergic to the stuff brings them out in a cold sweat
29347,it clogs up their chest units suffocates them doesnt it
29348,originally mondas but that was destroyed you know im surprised they didnt mention me
29349,oh i doubt it especially as i confined them to a frozen tomb on telos didnt they mention that either oh well they have been forgetful
29350,listen the firings stopped
29351,look out
29352,and then
29353,theyre an invasion force earth is where they want to go there are considerably more than a few on board
29354,unfortunately cybermen dont need it is there any way you could jettison the hold
29355,not at all
29356,not yet there may be a way to neutralise that
29357,theyve started i see from the computer the ship is powered by antimatter
29358,how is the antimatter contained
29359,is there any way we could tap the stabilising device
29360,excellent
29361,yes
29362,we are under attack adric
29363,all right first tell me what is the square root of three point six nine eight seven three
29364,oh hes very good and almost right
29365,antimatter powers the ship for the antimatter to remain safe it has to be contained in a vessel with a totally stable molecular structure otherwise it would well blow to bits
29366,absolutely right although with computercontrolled electronics it is possible to simulate it
29367,right however destructive the antimatter is the vessel is always stable
29368,oh it is
29369,well if it doesnt were dead
29370,right hurry
29371,right
29372,just a second
29373,i should have realised
29374,er no er
29375,you never change always the perfect guests
29376,fondness im surprised your emotionless brain understands the word
29377,youve tried before
29378,i suspect the ship is now on a locked off fixed coordinate
29379,yes
29380,because i think theyre turning us into a flying bomb
29381,i didnt know it was lost
29382,the reason for the red alert
29383,so you destroy a few presidents in a needlessly destructive way
29384,of course a war you couldnt possibly win
29385,destroy the conference and you destroy the unity
29386,so the freighter replaces the bomb
29387,if the freighter crashes into earth with you on board wont that make it rather difficult for you to carry out your task i mean you would be very crumpled
29388,you dont surprise me
29389,compared to some this one is positively flippant
29390,where did you come from
29391,an earthling no one of consequence
29392,be quiet
29393,in a manner of speaking
29394,of sorts
29395,emotions have their uses
29396,they also enhance life when did you last have the pleasure of smelling a flower watching a sunset eating a wellprepared meal
29397,for some people small beautiful events is what life is all about
29398,shes a friend
29399,i do not
29400,no
29401,no
29402,this isnt necessary let them go
29403,youve already proved your point quite adequately
29404,i want adric too
29405,i need him to help me fly the tardis
29406,im not going without him
29407,good luck adric
29408,good luck to you all
29409,hes safe
29410,yes
29411,it isnt necessary to taunt her
29412,not at the moment
29413,gently tegan
29414,no you do things like that well all finish up dead
29415,the freighters jumped time warps
29416,where
29417,i cant
29418,its physically impossible the freighter is no longer on a fixed course the coordinates are constantly changing thats why it keeps fading ive got nothing to lock on to
29419,although the freighter is spiraling backwards in time its still locked on to the same spatial coordinates
29420,yes
29421,earth
29422,it may be of some small consequence to know weve travelled backwards in time some sixty five million years
29423,think about it
29424,the antimatter vessel will split open on impact there will be a tremendous explosion
29425,it seems inevitable as is your history as we know it
29426,not at all youve lost the earth is safe
29427,youve failed leader
29428,get down
29429,the consoles damaged
29430,i must save adric
29431,crew of the freighter safely returned to their own time
29432,we feel his loss as well
29433,no
29434,and change your own history
29435,now listen to me both of you there are some rules that cannot be broken even with the tardis dont ever ask me to do anything like that again you must accept that adric is dead his life wasnt wasted he died trying to save others just like his brother varsh you know adric had a choice this is the way he wanted it
29436,and me but he wouldnt want us to mourn unnecessarily
29437,special treat to cheer us all up
29438,hyde park the crystal palace
29439,all the wonders of victorian science and technology
29440,how about opening day pass the time of day with the foreign royals we could even drop in at lords see a few overs from wisden and pilch i wonder if the lion will be bowling
29441,yes all right
29442,it could be the relative drift compensator
29443,feedback from the solar comparator no
29444,another ship what do you mean another ship
29445,if we dont materialise the tardis will be destroyed
29446,somewhere above hyde park the view should be spectacular
29447,youre right
29448,coordinate override a sort of anticollision device
29449,so i have
29450,well well only be here a moment i hope
29451,i am ah
29452,i wont be a moment
29453,i dont know what english cricket is coming to
29454,hmm
29455,well i try to be
29456,nonsense well be away from here in no time
29457,is that a good idea
29458,yes of course security
29459,unit
29460,youd do much better to check with unit department c19 sir john sudbury is the man you want
29461,oh just tell him its the doctor and do send my regards to brigadier lethbridge stewart unless of course hes a general by now
29462,be quiet im thinking
29463,well we will eventually
29464,look tegan this is your planet i would have thought you wanted to help
29465,well i might be able to help
29466,hello and this is nyssa and tegan
29467,now i believe youre having problems with concorde
29468,disappeared
29469,indeed i wonder
29470,remember the turbulence we experienced
29471,yes i wonder very much indeed
29472,exactly
29473,i suspect its not a question of where but er when
29474,we must follow the same route same height same speed and with my equipment on board i can identify what i believe to be an exponential time contour
29475,exactly and we cant have a navigational hazard like that hanging about the galaxy
29476,and this is nyssa and tegan
29477,right
29478,it would seem to be the logical explanation
29479,ah youre forgetting the tardis
29480,thats right      stapley
29481,this thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside
29482,so useful when you want to maintain a dignified attitude
29483,concorde has just flown into the time contour
29484,oh i doubt it captain its simply reacting to centuries of galactic radiation through which were passing
29485,im afraid your radio is useless captain by my estimation were the spatial equivalent of four hundred billion miles from air traffic control  man
29486,thats why this tree doth continue to be since observed by yours faithfully god
29487,to be is to be perceived a naive eighteenth century philosophy
29488,nothing there i wonder perceptual induction
29489,i want you all to concentrate very hard
29490,concentrate look at anything observe it in every detail
29491,perceptual induction and im undoing it concentrate its the only way to fight it and find out where we really are
29492,no you think youre at heathrow so did i well almost up to a moment ago now concentrate all together it must be a concerted effort
29493,you see the coherence is breaking up
29494,just where you thought we were captain
29495,some a hundred and forty million years ago
29496,quite the reverse mister scobie youve just woken up
29497,definitely jurassic theres a nip in the air though we cant be far off the pleistocene era
29498,its times like this i wish i still had my scarf better watch out for the odd brontosaurus
29499,i doubt it but i should think they came from this time zone
29500,have you another explanation
29501,very violently by the look of it
29502,its like having a tooth out under hypnosis you dont feel a thing
29503,so was the indian rope trick
29504,oh dont worry captain well find them lets hope no one finds us first
29505,behind every illusion theres a conjurer in this case i shouldnt think he went to all this trouble for our entertainment
29506,tegan wait all of you stay here
29507,i doubt it the illusion is always one of normality
29508,i think the answer might be over there
29509,been here a long time
29510,captain stapley are you all right
29511,what creatures
29512,oh you mean the plasmatons
29513,protein agglomeration random particles assembled from the atmosphere quite harmless i assure you
29514,oh isnt there now what about the energy that telepathically generated the idea that we were at heathrow you think that cant operate on a physical level
29515,its simply a form of psychokinesis
29516,what
29517,and this is nyssa and tegan
29518,yes im sorry if we seem like an unlikely rescue party
29519,well dont worry youre not imagining us
29520,who are they professor hayter
29521,guards oh you mean the plasmatons
29522,oh it doesnt matter at least you managed to get away without alerting these guards look i want you to show us the way to this mausoleum
29523,and ive got to find my tardis
29524,come on then
29525,keep still
29526,who are you
29527,the intelligence its using nyssa as a medium
29528,be quiet who are you what do you want
29529,someone wanted to stop her talking
29530,im afraid we dont have the right kind of energy
29531,well if we could find the source of the power we might be able to free her
29532,tegans right look shell be perfectly all right as soon as shes free you both go back to the concorde
29533,and dont try and follow us captain professor
29534,is that a reason for abandoning your fellow passengers
29535,something with the same resource of psychokinetic energy
29536,it could well be
29537,those guards as you call them are fully occupied with nyssa
29538,the creatures you saw are particles of protoplasm bonded by psychic energy the essential protoplasm can take any shape
29539,yes but i suspect the power and raw material is limited so as long as nyssa is trapped
29540,scientifically speaking i think we should find the others      the passageway passes entrances to a large welllight area some people are trying to prise open a large stone object
29541,i wonder if they know where the tardis is
29542,it cant be far away
29543,you say that as if you expect a round of applause
29544,your domain
29545,well i apologise for my levity not to mention my curiosity
29546,what youre doing in this time zone for a start
29547,would the spirit have anything to do with the ruins of that spaceship out there
29548,yes
29549,ah then exactly how do you travel
29550,magic arabia oh come on you can do better than that
29551,oh yes yes youre surrounded by a lot of powerful bioenergetics kalid but i cant help feeling theres something a great deal more mechanistic about all this
29552,what are you doing sitting at the end of a time contour like a spider in a web and what do you want with my tardis
29553,your spirits are very wellinformed
29554,not just me kalid what do you want with all these passengers
29555,you have the plasmatons
29556,you mean you need the psychotronic energy for something else
29557,we
29558,you can exclude me from your wizardry
29559,very impressive kalid but your incantation is just triggering someone elses energy youre not in control here youre just as mortal as anyone else
29560,ive always found domination such an unattractive prospect
29561,there is no power that will give you control of the tardis
29562,kalid
29563,no
29564,hes thrown up a barrier i did try and warn you
29565,youre wasting your time kalid
29566,ive already told you
29567,out of bounds are they kalid
29568,you mean youve not been able to
29569,well kalid it seems a power greater than yours is protecting them
29570,its your powerhouse is it
29571,no
29572,i dont think so weve all got quite good at resisting your sorcery
29573,im not so sure about this one
29574,kalid is drawing on deeper reserves of power and that thing is bonding itself into something far more dangerous than a plasmaton
29575,the answer is still no kalid
29576,the powers gone
29577,you wont find what youre looking for
29578,i dont understand    master
29579,so you escaped from castrovalva i should have guessed
29580,the crystal is simply a point of focus the communication is purely telepathic
29581,what indeed
29582,for a new source of power i think youre too late it seems to have expended itself
29583,oh theyre as likely to have been protected as destroyed the power works against as well as for you
29584,no heroics please gentlemen the master will eliminate you without a second thought
29585,not exactly the first class end of the market but a serviceable vehicle captain
29586,i do not wish to believe therefore i hallucinate is that the philosophy of darlington men professor
29587,try telling that to tegan and nyssa when the master materialises in the sanctum
29588,the power source is unstable sometimes it works for the master sometimes against
29589,i dont know but i intend to find out
29590,no no just the professor and myself
29591,youve seen the hallucinogenic effects the power source can have the closer you get the stronger it is you wouldnt be able to resist
29592,the professor has shown stronger resistance than most by the way if the master turns up again dont be surprised it may take him a little time to discover i left the er coordinate override switched in ready
29593,exactly
29594,lets hope they still have enough strength left to break down the wall for us
29595,thats not necessarily a good thing
29596,are you any good at explanations
29597,are your passengers unharmed
29598,oh im sure of it either theyve been pressganged into other work or theyre locked up safely out of harms way
29599,the masters tardis
29600,of course thats where hes hidden the other passengers
29601,something else for me to explain later
29602,the time yes thats another thing
29603,whats this
29604,an induction loop so thats how he generated the time contour dont you see what this means
29605,hes already harnessing the power in the loop in the chamber in the sanctum
29606,the wall is much more important tegan and nyssa are behind it
29607,now you dont have to come in if you dont want to
29608,good man the rest of you stay here
29609,theyre just stunned
29610,are you all right
29611,you rest a while
29612,look in the sarcophagus professor
29613,an immeasurable intelligence at the centre of a psychic vortex all seeing all knowing
29614,it didnt thats why it deflected your attack
29615,a massive burst of psychokinetic energy
29616,the power diverted to defend itself
29617,jekyll and hyde
29618,oh not the creature itself the power was being used by the master
29619,part of the benign intelligence must have triggered a hidden mechanism
29620,we had to force our way in
29621,the power must be returning
29622,well someone filled in the hole
29623,whatever part of the intelligence that is now controlling them wants us walled up in here
29624,till the master turns up with the tardis
29625,the xeraphin
29626,a legendary race long since extinct
29627,theyre supposed to have lived on the planet xeraphas before it was devastated by crossfire in the vardonkosnax war
29628,oh theres nothing green about the xeraphin i assure you highly developed creatures beings with immense mental power
29629,its the weapon i warned you against if the master used it on you youd end up just like this they must have come out of the casket
29630,dont you see cellular fusion reduction to a hypostatic amalgam no wonder the animus is so strong apart from the masters victims the entire race of the xeraphin is in this sarcophagus
29631,the whole race physically amalgamated into one organism with one immense personality thats why the master came here thats why he laid this loop around the chamber he wants this at the centre of his tardis
29632,he must have exhausted his own dynomorphic generator
29633,and infinitely more powerful
29634,we must find a way out of here
29635,no nyssa youll be absorbed
29636,no stop nyssa talk to me explain it to me
29637,but the knowledge will consume you
29638,no professor
29639,it will destroy you you dont understand what youre doing
29640,professor hayter get back from there
29641,the molecular structure has completely broken up
29642,i think the xeraphin is trying to materialise
29643,what are the xeraphin doing on earth anithon
29644,radiation poisoning
29645,you achieved the absorption of a whole race into a single bioplasmic body
29646,what went wrong
29647,the master
29648,weve seen their remains
29649,how did the master gain so much control over your psychic power
29650,but surely theres more good than evil in the xeraphin and the good is controlling the power that helped tegan and nyssa and is still resisting the master
29651,well have to deal with the master first
29652,zarak thats just a dream the master will use the power for his own evil purposes hell never allow you to regenerate
29653,the argument of course the debate between black and white xeraphin whichever xeraphin wins will control their combined power
29654,zarak is summoning other evil xeraphin
29655,how can we help you
29656,you must
29657,the masters perfected the induction loop
29658,it means the master has finally defeated me
29659,well it would help if you could remember where you came in
29660,then we have to resort to brute force
29661,how do you suggest we make contact
29662,captain stapley
29663,my dear captain you really are the most remarkable man to pilot the tardis and with such precision perhaps you could take us to the other side of that wall
29664,no
29665,possibly a telepathic projection perhaps he isnt really dead
29666,hello
29667,have you seen another tardis
29668,could well be
29669,i dont think so hes still in this time zone he cant be far away
29670,in its new state the masters tardis wont be fully operational yet hes got the nucleus all right but hell need to work on it
29671,the passengers
29672,captain your passengers are now in greater danger than ever before
29673,ill explain later nyssa i want you to take the tardis back to the concorde cargo hold captain i want you and your crew to get your aircraft ready for takeoff immediately
29674,wing and a prayer captain
29675,well im sure youll do your very best tegan come with me nyssa the coordinates are all set
29676,and taken everything with him including the bits of my tardis
29677,molecular disintegration that way the master has a neat little store of protoplasm with which he can do anything he wants
29678,in a manner of speaking lets get back to captain stapley
29679,theres something wrong
29680,no no you cant can you come on
29681,ill explain later wheres my tardis
29682,hmm captain is your aircraft all right
29683,ah not a good idea
29684,if that were concorde
29685,that aircraft was damaged now its in perfect condition
29686,im afraid not thats the masters tardis
29687,the masters operated his chameleon circuit
29688,is inside the masters tardis of course i wish i had time to explain dimensional transcendentalism look im going into my tardis you stay here
29689,theres no other way
29690,theres no time for anything else
29691,without the bits he stole from my tardis we can only travel in this time zone
29692,im afraid so
29693,ah well thats the way it goes if you will steal other peoples property  whats he talking about nyssa have you been tampering with the tardis
29694,have you any idea what would have happened if id tried to go
29695,you captain
29696,stupid it was brilliant  your prospects seem rather limited
29697,ah but such a restricted range
29698,you return all the passengers we have access to both aircraft you return all the components of my tardis not necessary for the normal functioning of your machine
29699,a temporal limiter
29700,hell never give that up without it his tardis is useless
29701,well well know that in a moment
29702,captain ill need your aircraft ready for takeoff as soon as possible
29703,now you two stay here
29704,you seem to have mislaid the quantum accelerator
29705,if youd be so good as to follow me
29706,right ill run a line from the tardis oh youll need a compressed air supply
29707,and he hasnt got the temporal limiter the idea you see is to keep him waiting until were ready to take off
29708,no i need the tardis to deal with the master
29709,im thinking about it
29710,good i just need a few more minutes
29711,oh well wed better not keep him waiting
29712,the temporal limiter
29713,heathrow actually
29714,hes virtually running in a new tardis in order to check out the temporal dimensions hell need to track back the line of the time contour
29715,yes
29716,quite right shall we go on board
29717,not with my temporal limiter in circuit
29718,of course it does you dont think i could fool the master do you mind you there is an inhibition factor inherent in the er programming
29719,hell arrive after us
29720,ready to go
29721,ah ill just programme your flight computer
29722,well its heathrow airport we appear to be on schedule for a change
29723,ah now what we needs a diversion now with a bit of luck not to mention judgement
29724,knocked back into timespace like a straight six into the pavilion
29725,oh they stand a much better chance on their own planet
29726,that was millions of years ago the atmosphere will be perfectly clear by now not a very nice climate for the master though
29727,well i think with that extra energy on board my temporal limiter will need replacing
29728,yes lets hope its for good now wheres tegan
29729,ah well really officer were were just in transit as it were
29730,er you know my friend the airport controller im sure he can give you a full explanation
29731,er well ill just make a quick phone call which should clear the whole thing up
29732,and such a simple repair job
29733,well you know how it is you put things off for a day next thing you know its a hundred years later
29734,mmm
29735,perfect
29736,and now we have nothing to look at couldnt be better peace and quiet is just what the doctor ordered
29737,well theres nothing urgent is there
29738,no well you see ever since the cybermen damaged the console
29739,yes well nobodys perfect
29740,sensors show were converging with a massive source of magnetic radiation
29741,well somethings causing it we must change course
29742,anywhere so as long as its away from here
29743,i dont know
29744,i know
29745,i just tried
29746,somethings coming through
29747,no extradimensional
29748,how long have i been here
29749,from another dimension
29750,from the tardis yes
29751,well for a moment it did what you saw was an attempted temporal bonding the molecular realignment of two basically incompatible lifeforms
29752,are you sure then its worse than i feared
29753,oh it is somewhere and halfway to achieving its purpose it wont have given up that easily
29754,matter and antimatter in collision yes i take your point come on weve got work to do
29755,theyre very rare on burnout it creates quardal magnetism thats what the sensors picked up its the only force known to shield antimatter
29756,has to be but its known to decay rapidly anything else
29757,thats it nyssa thats how it came through what we saw was the gateway to the dimensions the arc of infinity
29758,right
29759,which in my case exists only in the matrix on gallifrey
29760,hmm this creature controls the shift of the arc just think of it nyssa with such power you can unlock the door to travel between the dimensions of matter and antimatter
29761,high council of time lords were being taken back to gallifrey
29762,i dont know it must be urgent only twice before in our history has the recall circuit been used
29763,the security compound in the heart of the citadel
29764,handprint activated from the outside fetch my indent kit from the workbench will you i might just be able to trip it quickly      receptionist
29765,not now nyssa
29766,i wish i could believe that
29767,it wont be that easy to track this creature down the universe is rather a big place and there is an easier alternative
29768,possibly
29769,i doubt it not with this kind of lock and certainly not as quickly         guard
29770,the computer room its not far now
29771,well they certainly know weve arrived
29772,not the most welcoming return
29773,thats the only way to keep me and the tardis here
29774,we need a link something to prove the connection between this creature and gallifrey
29775,theres no need for all the fire power
29776,the council chamber i suppose
29777,my companion is not involved in this
29778,councillors
29779,and you hedin nyssa my old friend councillor hedin councillors my companion nyssa of traken
29780,given the chance i would have returned willingly
29781,romana chose to stay in espace
29782,yes well now that im here thalia have you given any thought to whats happened
29783,has anyone checked to see if my biodata extracts have been removed from the matrix castellan
29784,i would have thought that was obvious none of this could have happened unless the creature had that information
29785,indeed president borusa
29786,without knowing its purpose here
29787,lord president this creature is here now because it bonded with me to do so it needed something very special full and precise details of my biological makeup now i didnt pass this information on somebody did the question is who
29788,chancellor can bonding occur without the full imprint of a socalled bioscan
29789,lord president i ask for time to have this fully investigated
29790,i have a great deal to say
29791,executing me will not alter the fact theres a traitor at work on gallifrey
29792,damon
29793,he is a friend of mine
29794,you dont have to relish them so much
29795,your guards will not allow me to leave the console room
29796,if im to die i want to prepare myself mentally for that i need to be alone
29797,my companions it has already been searched
29798,my bioscan
29799,so soon what about my appeal
29800,how did you get in here
29801,well thats very generous of the castellan come well walk while we speak
29802,excellent well damon what news of my old companion leela      damon
29803,in here maxil has just planted a listening device in the console room well now we have proof my biodata extract was removed from the matrix
29804,indeed and a disaster in the making unless im mistaken gallifrey could lose control of the spacetime matrix
29805,thats exactly what the high council think so we must see what we can do to stop it happening look damon i know youve already risked a great deal for me but could i impose on you a little further
29806,i need another spacetime element for the tardis preferably without a recall circuit
29807,yes you could check to see if the matrix is aware of any details concerning power equipment movement transportation
29808,well commander our time is up so soon well nyssa thats my final word no appeals we must accept the decision of the high council understood
29809,and the decision was unanimous
29810,thank you hedin i much appreciate all youve done
29811,no nyssa i will not have blood spilt to save my life
29812,theyre right nyssa we cannot escape
29813,please you must obey the lord president i know what im doing the weapon please
29814,who are you
29815,i must be in the matrix
29816,i knew you couldnt let me die
29817,i guessed besides i hoped it would give me the chance to meet you
29818,itd difficult to say without knowing who you are
29819,if you have something to offer the time lords why not speak directly
29820,then you must be known to gallifrey
29821,it would mean losing control of the matrix to you the price is too high
29822,thats very generous of you may i ask what ive done to deserve it
29823,i will do everything i can to stop you
29824,tegan
29825,no its a trick its not tegan
29826,it cant be tegans on earth i know she is
29827,all right whatever you say
29828,as yours depends on mine
29829,wait
29830,pity long cancelled i expect presidential code four five four four five five three nine one
29831,pure luck
29832,there wasnt time nyssa damon did you do as i asked
29833,what about the power equipment anything turn up
29834,fusion
29835,what from water
29836,now listen damon this is very important i need to know the precise destination and who sent it do you think you could find that out
29837,were going to earth nyssa
29838,thats where this creature is
29839,its got tegan i saw her in the matrix
29840,pity
29841,who
29842,the lord president
29843,well we must see the lord president immediately
29844,thank you for all your help damon i shall never be able to repay you
29845,no
29846,hedin you dont believe this stuff about the lord president
29847,what is it
29848,so its you
29849,the bioscan the rigged termination all your work hedin
29850,it was all done to make us think you were responsible lord president and now hedin
29851,its that close
29852,i always considered you a friend hedin a man of learning respected by all why now turn to evil
29853,this creature will soon control the matrix is that what you want
29854,omega
29855,but omega died
29856,omega is insane once in control of the matrix
29857,you fool he could have told us where omega is
29858,lord president we must shut down the matrix
29859,no but it could delay it give us time to hunt omega down
29860,its too late omega controls the matrix        omega
29861,you seriously believe you can reverse what happened  omega
29862,omega listen
29863,we know hes on earth
29864,perhaps but i would have to enter the matrix to find out
29865,please nyssa
29866,wait in the tardis please
29867,well omega youve won we cant stop you now
29868,that was an accident is tegan safe
29869,prove it let me speak to her
29870,i told you youve won even if we know where you are we cant leave gallifrey you know that
29871,shes unharmed
29872,yes
29873,dont worry tegans unharmed
29874,one or two things ive got to get together
29875,good
29876,omegas using a fusion booster to build up energy to transfer if we can attach this it should knock it out of phase
29877,hopefully itll feed the power back through his own equipment
29878,exactly hows the meter
29879,i dont believe it
29880,i think we made it come on
29881,when i spoke to tegan she mentioned her cousin and the jhc
29882,she risked her life to give us that piece of information if we find out what the jhc is it might lead us to where she is
29883,well start with the telephone directory
29884,wont we jhc jhc jhc jhc jhc jeugdherberg central youth hostels must be where tegan was staying
29885,well theres not many of them well give them a ring ah nyssa money
29886,afraid so antimatter present but steady omega hasnt transferred yet but it cant be much longer
29887,if only it were that easy
29888,no other choice we must check every hostel on foot
29889,cant risk it might alert omega this way
29890,well theres no other way
29891,we go on nyssa
29892,no theyve done all they can and now its up to us
29893,well it cant be long i fear omega is about to transfer
29894,and what about her cousin
29895,yes sorry well thank you
29896,yes
29897,no tegan is our only link
29898,yes
29899,may i see
29900,frankendael where is that
29901,could you show me
29902,thank you
29903,sorry sorry
29904,its only a matter of minutes the fountain tegan said behind the fountain
29905,of course ive been so silly amsterdam is located on the curve of the arc below sea level to maintain pressure for fusion conversion
29906,an ergon one of omegas less successful attempts at psychosynthesis quickly
29907,its too late omega you cant transfer now
29908,the arc of infinity is shifting go omega please while you still have a chance
29909,down
29910,no the bond is not complete
29911,its not permanent it will fail revert to antimatter
29912,i must find the matter converter i cant destroy omega without it tegan help me
29913,tegan hurry
29914,yes hed want to hide himself in the crowd well at least we have some idea of what hes wearing
29915,the biggest explosion this part of the universe is ever likely to witness
29916,i dont know the magnetic shield is in accelerated decay now
29917,hell revert to antimatter
29918,i see you omega
29919,this way
29920,hell be all right
29921,i warned you this would happen omega
29922,we didnt hate you omega why couldnt you be content to survive as you were why
29923,i can expel or destroy you omega its your choice
29924,willing his own destruction dont force me omega
29925,its over
29926,well he seemed to die before yet he returned to confound us all
29927,excellent
29928,its been marvellous to see you again
29929,so it seems  ltback to the episode listing
29930,were not where were supposed to be
29931,i dont know there are traces of antimatter
29932,oh highly unlikely hes still alive its not a navigational malfunction either
29933,no no theres no danger although its puzzling its very puzzling
29934,well at least we can breath the air i suppose thats something you look different
29935,the question is how did we get here
29936,former homeworld
29937,no no the other one
29938,this is serious someones been playing around who set the coordinates
29939,no no no earlier i was trying to teach both of you to read the star charts now one of you actually read out the coordinates for me to set who was it
29940,it was tegan
29941,the dream what dream
29942,but youve had this dream this particular dream before
29943,havent you
29944,always the same dream
29945,but the same feelings of fear remain
29946,she means it i think she could be right
29947,very simple question where are we
29948,no were not so
29949,think
29950,please tegan think reach into the back of your mind
29951,good
29952,yes we are
29953,manussa formerly homeworld of the sumaran empire which may or may not ring a bell does it tegan the sumaran empire
29954,yes we must recover tegans dream and simple hypnosis is the quickest way
29955,dreams are important nyssa never underestimate them once a man fell asleep dreamt he was a frog when he woke up he didnt know if he was a man who dreamt he was a frog or a frog who was now dreaming he was a man
29956,well have to see
29957,it does seem likely im sorry
29958,well obviously below the threshold of conscious thought i would imagine that when awake your mind is still strong enough to resist but in sleep it loosens its grip and battle is joined
29959,yes
29960,for control come over here
29961,its possible the mara seized temporary control and brought itself home now insert the earpiece try to relax and when switched on listen to the sound
29962,where are you now
29963,what are you doing there
29964,you must go deeper tegan much deeper where are you now
29965,how old are you
29966,tegan now you must leave your garden
29967,and go still deeper deeper and further much further can you hear me now i want you to go into the dream
29968,why not
29969,tegan youre perfectly safe you must go into the dream where are you now
29970,out where
29971,go in
29972,tegan you must go into the cave we need to know whats there
29973,tegan
29974,youre perfectly safe you must look we need to know what is there
29975,the mara speaking through tegans mouth
29976,it does as mental resistance weakens but this time i can prevent it
29977,with this it inhibits the production of brainwaves associated with dreaming
29978,we must find the cave the snake mouth in the dream
29979,oh yes whats more i would guess its somewhere nearby
29980,now she will be experiencing total exclusion of all outside sound so you must be her ears
29981,dreams are occurring in the mind all the time come on we must hurry
29982,i was right it seems theres a cave system near by that fits the description its er this way
29983,its the cave from her dream
29984,well youll have to stay with her ill go into the cave alone
29985,no im afraid its not
29986,director director of what
29987,are you indeed then you may be able to help
29988,at present it exists as a latent mental force in the mind of my companion
29989,its using her dreams to increase its power eventually it will take over her mind altogether but ive put together a device to inhibit this temporarily
29990,why dont you come and meet her shes outside
29991,certainly follow me  ambril my lord
29992,nyssa whats the matter
29993,what
29994,where
29995,come on
29996,oh this is hopeless what state was she in
29997,well lets go back to the tardis she might try and find her way back there
29998,well as long as shes wearing the antidream device she should be safe
29999,i dont know i just dont know why has the mara returned why now after so long what does it want            doctor
30000,no no no this is the maras homeworld the answers we need are out there ill try the director of the research institute and you look for tegan in the market well meet back here
30001,er hello
30002,do you
30003,look
30004,what ceremony
30005,when is it to be held
30006,impossible it must be called off at least until my companion is found
30007,what
30008,look the facts are these first of all my companion brought us here to this world without ever having been here before now why should she do that why here why now then i used hypnosis to establish the presence of the mara in her head you see she has a recurring dream
30009,and in this dream what is it
30010,the legend of the return
30011,well tell me look all i wants a little information what possible harm is there in that
30012,to the dark places of the inside
30013,im so sorry do go on
30014,what does it want
30015,the great crystal
30016,how can minds meet
30017,what is it
30018,try it on
30019,try it on
30020,please i want to show you something then ill go and leave you in peace
30021,now count the faces again
30022,and one makes six the sixth face of delusion is the wearers own that was probably the idea dont you think
30023,what is it
30024,indeed
30025,why are you telling me this
30026,do you believe in the legends
30027,one more question who are the snake dancers
30028,well where is she now
30029,was she marked
30030,on her arm the mark of the snake
30031,it must be the mara come on
30032,facts nyssa facts theres something i noticed before i need to take another look
30033,the maras waited a long time for this return i think it plans to be spectacular
30034,there now look what do you make of that there in the centre could that represent the great crystal
30035,and these lines from the centre energy of some sort
30036,what
30037,hmm minds meet in the great crystal but what are these now everything in this pictogram tells us something if we know how to read it so what are these
30038,the great crystal the great minds eye thats the clue the lines do represent the flow of mental energy but not going to the individual figures coming from them
30039,just as a lens focuses the rays of the sun the great minds eye gathered all the individual thought energies and concentrated them and amplified them and redirected them there
30040,now according to the legend the great crystal is the source of the maras power but where is it now what exactly were its properties oh if only we could take a look at the great crystal itself unless i wonder  the doctor takes the little minds eye from his pocket
30041,just think about it
30042,sit down
30043,yes
30044,it doesnt matter
30045,well try another way
30046,hmm im adjusting the frequency i need to eliminate all unnecessary outside noise as an aid to concentration there right lets try again you come and stand over here watch the crystal closely and observe any changes you ready
30047,right
30048,well of course its small its power is obviously limited
30049,youre missing the point nyssa its not what you saw but that you saw anything at all it proves the crystal has the quality of transforming thought into energy
30050,perhaps even into matter itself just think of the power the great crystal must have whatevers in your thought whatever in your mind it can actually make it occur
30051,exactly the mara needs the great crystal in order to make itself reoccur er stay here
30052,to warn ambril he knows where the great crystal is now he must be made to listen
30053,i do assure you it is most important where is the great minds eye
30054,the great crystal from the snake in the chamber
30055,you know where it is
30056,where
30057,the great crystal is the source of the maras power it needs that power to make itself reoccur thats why it has returned
30058,through the great crystal the mara will reoccur as a physical fact here on manussa
30059,how long am i to be locked up here
30060,well come on surely at least you can tell me that
30061,that will be too late whatever is to happen will happen at the ceremony
30062,do you think im inventing all this what would i have to gain
30063,but youre not sure it is all nonsense are you
30064,why did you tell me about the crystal
30065,what happened to dojjen
30066,the lock is extremely primitive its practically a museum piece theres no electronic impulse matrix to decode no sonic microcircuit to disrupt crude mechanical six barrel movement key operated primitive but adequate well its more than adequate actually because the key is what we dont have
30067,quickly
30068,id much rather you unlocked the door and let me out
30069,why dont you have the key
30070,ambril i suppose
30071,has the key in his room
30072,no wait wait of course im interested the last page you say
30073,its a reference to the great minds eye
30074,before he what
30075,before he what
30076,why what was the function of the dance
30077,what kind of powers
30078,yes of course
30079,so dojjen believed the legend of the mara to such an extent that he gave up everything went up into the hills to purify himself in readiness
30080,shush
30081,what do you suggest
30082,how
30083,well we havent so for the time being we must make use of what we do have
30084,this
30085,well
30086,this is a record of a journey a private mental journey now he must have discovered something that finally decided him
30087,oh i dont know the mara the history of the planet the origins of this crystal
30088,what
30089,yes of course i should have realised structurally perfect it has to be free of all flaws and distortions even the minute distortions produced by the effects of gravity
30090,the crystals were designed and built by a people who had mastered the techniques of molecular engineering in a zero gravity environment
30091,no and according to chela this crystal is eight hundred years old
30092,not necessarily i suspect that when they built the great crystal they overlooked one vital factor the nature of the mental energy would determine the nature of the matter created the great crystal absorbed what was in their minds the restlessness the hatred the greed absorbed it amplified it reflected it
30093,indeed and in the reign of evil which followed they must have forgotten the most important thing of all that the mara was something they themselves had blindly brought into being
30094,only some of it the rest he must have learned from the snake dancers who kept the knowledge alive hidden in traditions and legends
30095,he didnt know exactly when and nobody would listen just as no one will listen to us
30096,good question i dont know
30097,we wait
30098,patience
30099,i think he will
30100,no
30101,well done
30102,what made you change your mind
30103,youre forgetting tegan
30104,back the way we came
30105,your mother is right
30106,my only concern is for tegan and the great crystal
30107,if im allowed to live long enough ill explain
30108,but why
30109,why did you request it and why did he agree
30110,who said we wanted to assassinate you
30111,no of course not how foolish of me ive been very stupid do you remember me telling you nyssa on the kinda world the mark of the mara i should have realised
30112,wheres tegan what have you done with her
30113,you wont succeed in the end evil never does
30114,now
30115,to find tegan
30116,tegan wont die until the mara within her is free
30117,same reason as tegan he still has a lot of his own personality
30118,very much so
30119,what is it
30120,custom
30121,or what
30122,im afraid i dont have a coin
30123,i wish it was that easy
30124,how long have we got when does the actual ceremony begin
30125,how long
30126,i wonder if theres still time there must be its our only hope come on
30127,change of plan to find dojjen
30128,its not as simple as that
30129,we wouldnt be preventing the maras return only postponing it it would continue to exist as a mental force no this time we must destroy it completely
30130,i dont know
30131,i hope so
30132,youre forgetting we do have this
30133,it wont it will help him find us trust me
30134,this should be fine
30135,sympathetic resonance
30136,thought directed at this crystal should set up a resonance which is picked up and echoed by another
30137,well the snake dancers wear these dont they
30138,hopefully
30139,now we wait
30140,good question nyssa asked exactly the same thing
30141,i dont know perhaps well find that out too
30142,im afraid we have no choice if were to have any hope of saving tegan
30143,yes i do know    dojjen
30144,thought what no i survived
30145,i dont know somehow he saw me through
30146,yes of course the ceremony
30147,i think i did well have to see i just hope were not too late
30148,come on jump
30149,well lets hope were not too late
30150,come on come on hurry up
30151,now
30152,no no
30153,no i will not submit
30154,thank you  the doctor runs up the steps and pulls the great crystal from its socket the mara screams the snake shrinks and dissolves tegan collapses the crowd are freed from its influence dojjen walks away from the ruins the doctor goes and sits next to tegan who is back to her old aussie self and crying
30155,its all right its all over now
30156,well youre free of it now
30157,yes the mara has been destroyed  ltback to the episode listing
30158,tegan tegan tegan
30159,there isnt any need to be
30160,its your minds way of coping with the experience youve suffered a great deal
30161,no he couldnt the mara during the process of its becoming it had to be trapped between modes of its being
30162,well youre completely free of it now tegan for you the mara is dead forever
30163,indeed
30164,warp ellipse cut out
30165,and whats the probability of that
30166,im afraid its much more serious than that
30167,theres a chance somethings on a collision course with the tardis
30168,well theres a chance of anything statistically speaking if you gave typewriters to a tree full of monkeys theyd eventually produce the works of william shakespeare
30169,now you and i know that at the end of the millennium theyd still be tapping out gibberish
30170,we cant weve converged with the warp ellipse
30171,hold this steady
30172,ill try and materialise on board the ship hold tight
30173,i have a weird feeling the warp ellipse will be travelling for a very long time possibly through infinity
30174,amazing
30175,theres a length of flight indicator this ships been in orbit three thousand years
30176,mmm transmat terminal
30177,well someone certainly left the ship almost six years ago
30178,earth
30179,the ships orbit takes it within range of earth for six years
30180,any time come on lets get back to the tardis
30181,the tardis wont dematerialise
30182,i wonder
30183,the transmat beam its been operated the signal is interfering with the tardis
30184,well the capsule and the tardis must be dimensionally very similar and the beams still functioning its supposed to cut out when the capsule completes its journey
30185,i hope so
30186,ah
30187,in a manner of speaking its on earth
30188,if these readings are correct its 1983 on earth
30189,well the capsule originally left the ship six years ago
30190,yes i wonder what its been up to all that time come on back to the tardis
30191,who are you
30192,this is turlough
30193,the transmat capsule
30194,seven eight all set
30195,earth via the transmat capsule
30196,well it worked one way once ive disconnected the beam jamming the tardis you should follow me through to earth
30197,youll be safer in the tardis
30198,all right why not see you on earth
30199,come on
30200,done it
30201,not with the dead reckoning alignment in the coordinates this is 1983
30202,then it should be here
30203,i hope so now what did i do wrong
30204,brigadier brigadier alistair gordon lethbridge stewart
30205,brigadier
30206,id forgotten
30207,ive regenerated
30208,what would you say if i told you i was looking for my tardis
30209,what about our time together with unit
30210,so you do remember
30211,is there somewhere we could talk
30212,an undercover operation is it brigadier i mean i hardly expected to find you at a boys school
30213,your quarters
30214,quite
30215,brigadier i need your help ive lost the tardis
30216,and you dont remember me
30217,oh theres much more at stake than a breach of security ive lost my tardis youve lost your memory id be surprised if the two events werent connected
30218,by the way hows sergeant benton these days
30219,and harry sullivan
30220,do you ever see anything of jo grant
30221,my assistant jo grant  voice
30222,sarah jane  voice
30223,liz shaw youll remember of course  voice
30224,are you all right
30225,perhaps it was a yeti colonel lethbridge stewart
30226,its hardly your fault brigadier
30227,exactly
30228,the mental block there must be some reason for it some trauma some shocking experience maybe some induced effect
30229,no no of course not so if there was a way of tracing how far back the inhibition goes you could perhaps get some treatment
30230,well no
30231,absolutely
30232,brigadier
30233,when did you leave unit brigadier
30234,and you teach
30235,well brigadier much as i appreciate your company ive still got to find my tardis
30236,yes well just at the moment id settle for half a tardis and im very worried about nyssa and tegan
30237,whats the matter
30238,oh tegans after your time brigadier shes travelling with me in the tardis
30239,your tegan my tegan its the same person
30240,so tegan nyssa and the tardis theyre all here
30241,or rather they were if you see what i mean
30242,i must have miscalculated the offset the tardis came through in the right place but the wrong time zone
30243,now its vitally important you remember exactly what happened
30244,very much in the present brigadier you never did understand the interrelation of time
30245,you have in your memory the information i need to track down the tardis and communicate with nyssa and tegan
30246,what worries me is the level of coincidence in all this almost as if some cosmic influence still that wont get me the tardis back now brigadier weve got to establish the precise time all this happened
30247,well dont worry just relax think yourself back
30248,june the seventh 1977 well done brigadier come on
30249,hes trying to get away in the transmat capsule that is if he can repair the beam transmitter
30250,it could be done given time
30251,tegan is absolutely right i am not in the tardis
30252,you tell me brigadier
30253,dont you see brigadier the tardis came to earth in 1977 and so did the transmat capsule carrying someone from that ship in space
30254,indeed and what did you think
30255,you were there
30256,you must i need the information to protect nyssa and tegan
30257,that experience could be the reason for your nervous breakdown
30258,now come on weve got to get back to the capsule before turlough works out how to operate it or i may never get the tardis back
30259,reflect the beam back off the ship
30260,thats right
30261,always the optimist brigadier
30262,by the way yours i think
30263,turlough would you check to see if the transmitters functioning tegan and nyssa can use the beam as a beacon if all goes well the tardis should reappear ah brigadier quickly think did you go into the tardis with tegan and nyssa
30264,of course it matters can you imagine what would happen if you walked out of the tardis in 1977 and met yourself in 1983
30265,its not ridiculous brigadier almost certainly catastrophic
30266,obviously youd exist twice over and if the two of you met youd short out the time differential dont you see the blinovitch limitation effect oh dear as tegan would say zap
30267,oh no
30268,thank you brigadier the problem is now strictly academic i cannot even return to the ship
30269,unless i can assemble some equipment for tracking the tardis and soon
30270,indeed
30271,what did you say
30272,where
30273,brigadier where is it
30274,come on there isnt a moment to lose
30275,it isnt working
30276,hopefully
30277,thats it
30278,it must be on the ship im a fool i should have realised
30279,yes come on the capsule
30280,youre forgetting this the tardis is on board the ship and this will home in on the tardis come on
30281,good of you to come and see me off brigadier
30282,the transmat could be dangerous
30283,if you insist
30284,turlough could be useful
30285,it still exists but if youre so concerned about turlough set an example and stay behind
30286,come on        brig 77
30287,the creature will have left the tardis by now hell need his own life support systems
30288,someone on this ship has been trying to regenerate  brig 83
30289,there have been some very cunning modifications  brig 83
30290,right
30291,er wait here
30292,wheres turlough
30293,and the brigadier but ive lost both of them
30294,you mean hes here with you as well
30295,how could you be so stupid
30296,he also insisted on coming with me
30297,precisely come on weve got to find them
30298,it was you who stole the regenerator from gallifrey
30299,and you modified the machine and created endless life for yourself
30300,ah you induced a perpetual mutation
30301,how were you able to come to earth
30302,its the result of your own criminal ambition
30303,fools who tried to turn themselves into time lords it all went disastrously wrong
30304,for what its worth
30305,no
30306,i cant
30307,dont you understand if i did it would be the end of me as a time lord
30308,dont you see eight of them eight of me
30309,its the only way to end their mutation
30310,with this equipment yes  brig 83
30311,you have the regenerator the facilities of the laboratory continue your experiments find how to reverse the process
30312,i must
30313,i dont know  brig 83
30314,you see brigadier thanks to your imperfect memory there is now a lethbridge stewart some six years your junior at loose in this ship  brig 83
30315,well i hope so because ive got to get the tardis away from here
30316,there isnt time to think brigadier  brig 83
30317,stay here all of you
30318,the two time zones the brigadier did go with tegan and nyssa there are now two lethbridge stewarts on this ship
30319,now i will take the brigadier in the tardis back to 1983 earth
30320,you must find the other brigadier and take him to the transmat capsule youll be quite safe the mutants wont harm you
30321,it will the capsule is locked into the tardis homing device it will transmat to the centre of the tardis i wired the device myself
30322,now when you arrive whatever you do stay in the capsule dont let the brigadier out until i give you the word now quickly
30323,im afraid so
30324,sometimes you have to live with the consequences of your actions now lets get away from here
30325,it takes a remarkably cunning set of the coordinates to clear a warp ellipse
30326,this is a temperamental old thing but im getting remarkably good at sorting
30327,not at all were on course for the brigadiers school you see there was a problem with  brig 83
30328,i dont know  brig 83
30329,no dont touch them the transfiguration can be controlled
30330,stop thats it travelling through time is accelerating the degeneration  brig 83
30331,you were infected when you carried mawdryn into the tardis the journey to his ship would have made it worse
30332,well it shouldnt be i can only assume their constant experimenting to correct their error brought about a viral side effect  brig 83
30333,that wont work ive got to programme a temporal deviation to escape the warp ellipse  brig 83
30334,oh no  brig 83
30335,were travelling in the opposite direction out of the ellipse its having a reverse effect
30336,someones trying to operate the transmat capsule must be turlough taking your other half to the centre of the tardis  brig 83
30337,take me to your laboratory
30338,you will activate the energy transfer brigadier it will take several moments for the charge in the machine to build up you can read off the countdown to the moment of exchange are you all right  brig 83
30339,activate brigadier now      guardian
30340,a massive discharge of energy exactly synchronising with the moment of transfer
30341,i dont think so
30342,its all right old friend  brig 83
30343,amazing the brigadiers timing a millisecond either way and
30344,at the moment of transfer the power didnt come from me
30345,well from the tardis really the two brigadiers just shorted out the time differential
30346,yes thats right zap
30347,youre as good as new
30348,i am a time lord
30349,they would have travelled for the rest of time tegan death was all they wanted come on we must get the brigadier back to 1977
30350,come on
30351,the ship is dying with the mutants
30352,yes hurry
30353,one has to move with the times how are you feeling  brig 83
30354,i think you already have  the doctor and turlough shake hands while tegan and nyssa roll their eyes at each other and mawdryns ship goes kaboom  ltback to the episode listing
30355,what is it
30356,were in trouble ill explain later
30357,the rotors jamming well theres a safety cut out
30358,well well see im trying to refocus the exterior viewer on the interior of the tardis
30359,dimensional instability thats the danger nyssa
30360,oh no the outside universe is breaking through
30361,i dont know but if she stays in the room shell die
30362,i dont know
30363,another spacecraft
30364,the tardis found it theres a failsafe on impending breakup it seeks out and locks onto the nearest spacecraft
30365,well it never worked before
30366,shes gone stay there
30367,what have i sent you into nyssa
30368,nyssa
30369,i think its some sort of old passenger liner
30370,yes well some people have the strangest ideas about decor come on lets get back to the tardis
30371,ah i dont remember this we must have taken a wrong turn
30372,a massive plug the hull must have been damaged at some time
30373,yes i know come on well try er this way
30374,certainly not
30375,we have a ship of our own
30376,unarmed
30377,hardly
30378,raiders by the look of it probably an advance party to open the airlocks
30379,yes
30380,i think not
30381,if you put the guns away please
30382,i think we should get out of here follow me
30383,whatever you do dont let them touch you
30384,look at them i doubt if they can feed themselves let alone fight
30385,no i rather think hes got a lot to tell us
30386,dying some cargo you came to steal
30387,indeed
30388,in a moment can you see any more computer blocks
30389,information about terminus there must be something here the liners just docked with it
30390,must be terminus nyssa
30391,what do you make of this
30392,nyssas right how do you know about lazars disease
30393,on terminus
30394,and you didnt try and find out why
30395,what do you make of this
30396,in all you heard about terminus was there ever any comment on its position
30397,theres something very strange about this
30398,well it could be pure coincidence but terminus seems to be at the exact centre of the known universe  space liner floor plates
30399,its no wonder we got lost
30400,look
30401,we must get out of here  space liner floor plates
30402,we cant have missed the door there was a book lying on the floor
30403,thats the wave pattern the tardis homed in on  space liner floor plates
30404,someones calling
30405,stage two sterilisation come on
30406,down there
30407,then why dont they reply tell me the star charts on the liner do you think they were accurate
30408,let her go
30409,id appreciate some help
30410,no hes wearing radiation armour keep him covered
30411,come on
30412,well at least the levels acceptable for the time being come on
30413,why do the crew put up with such a radiation leak
30414,olvir said there wasnt one so why dont they repair it
30415,hmm radiation fallout now thats a thought
30416,nothing just an idea worth pursuing
30417,well he seems happy enough lets find out
30418,hes hurt hello im the doctor can i help
30419,terminus entrance at least we know where the radiation comes from
30420,indeed im the doctor
30421,a little
30422,in what way
30423,chain reaction
30424,when
30425,some sort of signal
30426,the control lines the ones bor said he followed
30427,yes youre right about the sickness i want to find out what he discovered
30428,i think it could be rather important
30429,terminus control
30430,do you remember bor saying one of the engines had exploded
30431,he was wrong it didnt come to that look at this terminus was once capable of time travel
30432,well to push a ship of this size through time would require an enormous amount of energy
30433,well think about what weve learnt terminus seems to be at the centre of the universe yes now imagine this ship in flight suddenly the pilot finds he has an enormous amount of unstable fuel on board what would you do
30434,perfectly normal procedure unfortunately he ejects his fuel into a void
30435,starting a chain reaction
30436,enormous biggest explosion of all time event one
30437,yes
30438,a chemical reaction in a primeval swamp can create life on a planet why couldnt the universe be created by a similar chance factor hmm
30439,it only appears simple because the circumstances were exactly right
30440,well the pilot timejumped the ship forward before realising how unstable the fuel was the resulting shockwave must have caught up with him boosting the ship billions of years into the future
30441,yes
30442,not quite whereas the first explosion created the universe the second would undoubtedly destroy it  space liner floor plates
30443,i dont know oh no
30444,it wasnt the pilots decision the computers just started an automatic sequence to jettison the unstable fuel if we dont do something quickly the whole universe will be destroyed
30445,not yet
30446,its controlled by the computer and the computers uncontrollable  space liner floor plates
30447,the technology here is phenomenal unfortunately there must be a way to reset that handle
30448,a giant
30449,the garm
30450,well we can only hope there is
30451,you ready
30452,lets just get into the control room ill do the rest
30453,well humour him right lets go
30454,id appreciate it if youd hurry
30455,if you can return the lever i can disconnect the computer controlling it
30456,its the end of the universe
30457,it must you must push harder its the only way
30458,thats it
30459,indeed you have
30460,rest youve earned it come on
30461,youre taking a very narrow view of all this
30462,youre quite happy to see things go on as they are
30463,things could change
30464,nyssa ive been so worried
30465,how do you know
30466,well you think it could be
30467,well he has it now
30468,where is it
30469,its locked olvir may i borrow your laser
30470,youre the expert what do you think
30471,think you can synthesise it
30472,how do you do im the doctor and this is nyssa
30473,yes well before you start perhaps one of you could show us the way to the damaged engine theres still a great deal to be done
30474,itll be good to see the tardis again
30475,yes well itll be nice to know shes safe tegan
30476,what are you doing
30477,i told you not to follow me
30478,yes well im pleased to see her but she shouldnt have followed us
30479,yes well well talk about it later valgard
30480,now its important you inform the authorities about whats been going on here make it impossible for terminus incorporated to retaliate for example you must make contact with the pickup ship
30481,the one that takes the cured lazars away well the garm will know all about it
30482,then speak to him win his confidence youll find him very agreeable
30483,what is it
30484,what
30485,well you cant stay it isnt safe certainly not until the vanir have sorted out how theyre to run terminus
30486,you do fully understand the commitment youll be undertaking
30487,and that life here will be very hard
30488,then youre a very brave person i wish you every luck
30489,ah
30490,interesting it isnt a leak
30491,no our powers being tapped somehow
30492,its just draining away i dont understand
30493,im sorry did you say something
30494,oh well er well block the outlet there for a while well just have to run on reduced power  white guardian
30495,quiet im trying to listen to something
30496,im not quite sure it must have been my imagination
30497,thats it of course a message turn up the power
30498,power
30499,we must increase energy output now push that lever to full
30500,of course now keep it at full whatever happens
30501,were giving you everything weve got it is you isnt it
30502,keep it going
30503,quiet keep back stay in the console room nine zero
30504,what not allow what
30505,never ever disobey my instructions again
30506,and because of you many others might die
30507,the white guardian
30508,ive no time to explain i have to sort out these coordinates
30509,i dont know i lost contact before i could get more information
30510,prevent something happening something dangerous
30511,no but when the white guardian says theres danger hes invariably right
30512,time override locking must have been in the coordinates were here
30513,well i have to find out whats going on turlough get a couple of torches
30514,no i need you here
30515,the white guardian may try and make contact again
30516,no i need someone i can rely on its important
30517,save the arguing until later
30518,operate this lever his powers badly depleted hes having to draw on ours to get through at all
30519,yes exactly
30520,well apart from the coordinates i could understand very little
30521,no there may not be time
30522,yes and going out is the only way to learn what it is
30523,thank him politely wont be long
30524,listen rats
30525,i dont think so look at this
30526,really look again
30527,were on a ship a sailing ship the hold probably
30528,i didnt know you were so keen to find it down
30529,checking the stores
30530,yes almost as though he were hypnotised still at least he didnt find the tardis come on
30531,no its a door
30532,gently turlough this one will do for me you can take that one
30533,behaving as if weve just joined the crew edwardian england
30534,so it seems
30535,theyre sizing us up focsles fairly cramped its important to know who youre sharing it with after all we could be cooped up here together for months
30536,only if were both here for the trip
30537,no i must find out why the white guardian wanted me to come here
30538,we stay
30539,yes thanks
30540,ah turlough and im the doctor
30541,youve been expecting me
30542,the doctor of course the ships cook
30543,have you been below decks for two days
30544,how do you do did you all come aboard at the same time
30545,curious
30546,celebrating your last night ashore
30547,and youre quite sure not one of you can remember coming aboard
30548,surely surely you must find it rather strange that none of you can recall signing on
30549,you know where the tardis is if things get difficult
30550,what are you doing here
30551,youre unharmed did the white guardian make contact again
30552,well tell me everything you can remember
30553,well is that it
30554,well you did your best
30555,it may do especially as were on a racing yacht
30556,weve been talking to the crew
30557,how do you do im the
30558,please
30559,oh brave heart tegan
30560,youre not going with them
30561,hmm
30562,to find tegan if your courage is up to it shes on the way to the wheelhouse dont ask me why she left the tardis did you manage to find out anything about the race
30563,yes when weve found tegan
30564,are you all right
30565,maybe thisll tell us where we are
30566,oh theyre considerably more than that
30567,look at the screen were not on a yacht were on a ship a spaceship
30568,yes what about the officers
30569,no no its much more complicated than that tegan
30570,oh nonsense tegan the ships hardly moving
30571,now wait a minute
30572,yet
30573,look at the chart
30574,if you look carefully enough youll see its a solar system containing earth
30575,indeed look leave now find where marriners taken tegan
30576,i want to see what else i can find out here
30577,venus
30578,what are you proposing to do
30579,all the period detail is impressively accurate
30580,everything except that jewel
30581,the only think out of period why
30582,and the crews for the ships you collected from their different time zones just as a diversion too
30583,ephemerals
30584,you had no right to do it theyre real living breathing flesh and blood
30585,youre reading my thoughts
30586,and where do you function
30587,what are you doing
30588,do you think that wise were coming in too fast
30589,come about or youll crash
30590,heave to
30591,were running before the wind
30592,its some sort of ion drive it comes to the same thing
30593,well we had a lot of luck
30594,and winner takes all
30595,we must stay with it remember what the white guardian said winner takes all it has to be the winner of this race
30596,theyre not interested tegan
30597,no
30598,you saw the way the ship was manoeuvred around venus these vessels are built to withstand enormous stress
30599,or it was shot down it seems this race is getting serious someone is prepared to kill in order to win
30600,that we must find out i think its time we had a conference
30601,not here tegan your cabin ill meet you there in a moment
30602,then who did it
30603,oh it spoils the fun you mean what is against the rules
30604,you chose this ship
30605,and the crew
30606,but why i mean its not just to sail the ships is it no of course not you need their minds human minds
30607,ephemeral then from any planet any galaxy any time the minds of living beings you depend on them
30608,and i wonder where you got it from all your technology mind you if you can pick earth beings from nineteenth century england from the athens of pericles from the chin dynasty i suppose you can just as easily pick the minds of more advanced beings from other galaxies
30609,parasites thats what eternals are you feed on living minds you use them as blueprints
30610,oh absolutely i do see what you mean living minds are contaminated with crude emotions organic irrational creative entertaining
30611,you talk as though they were toys
30612,then why is one of you taking this race so seriously
30613,you dont know
30614,you didnt know though just for a second interesting
30615,whats the matter
30616,yes well they can make anything they see in your mind thats how this ship was made out of the minds of the crew just as this room was
30617,hmm
30618,oh no no they exist outside of time
30619,theyre eternal they exist in eternity its er its not really what youd call living
30620,we do their minds are empty used up they need ideas from us theyre desperate for them
30621,yes not till i find out whats at the end of the race
30622,i do understand how you feel but i must ask you to stay the tardis is the last thing i want them to find out about
30623,try to distract them give them something to worry about even an eternal cant put his mind to too many things at once come on
30624,all right wheres turlough
30625,turlough
30626,are you all right
30627,come on were taking tegan back to the tardis
30628,is he you can both wait for me in the tardis
30629,well it was here
30630,theyve found out about the tardis
30631,what have you done with the tardis
30632,what picture
30633,where have you taken
30634,will jackson be punished
30635,superior
30636,what are you competing for i mean the whole point of a race is to win something whats the prize
30637,enlightenment
30638,once weve found the tardis  black guardian
30639,hopefully turlough hopefully  black guardian
30640,no
30641,man overboard its turlough
30642,come on
30643,yes shes heaving to
30644,to talk to striker we must get to that ship
30645,i dont know but we must get him back
30646,it was an impulse you know how impulsive the young are no i dont suppose you do
30647,we could collect turlough
30648,well the launchll be alongside in a moment
30649,weve been hit
30650,well come along come along
30651,asteroid storm
30652,well they may not choose to use it against the rules of the race
30653,i dont think that worries them
30654,i dont know but its increasing
30655,were way ahead of the others this ship cant help winning
30656,especially to anyone who challenges captain wrack and the buccaneer
30657,have you forgotten the greek who challenged wracks ship i wonder if the same thing will happen to us
30658,fascinating a complete crosssection
30659,masters of sail and if theyre not theyre eternals like your friend marriner to them its just a game to pass the time i cant see turlough
30660,id noticed
30661,shes also an eternal tegan
30662,but we dont have your remarkable constitutions
30663,of course
30664,is she
30665,is it look i need to find turlough can you still sense his mind
30666,where is he concentrate
30667,that should sharpen the image
30668,where is the ion chamber
30669,look after tegan
30670,ah
30671,has to be the right way
30672,i reset it
30673,no what are you doing in here
30674,did she well it is part of the ion drive system
30675,better reception interesting
30676,wrack also uses this place as a receiver for something quite different
30677,do you know what that is
30678,only in appearance its function is that of a massive amplifier
30679,yes
30680,its only part of it theres still the question of focus
30681,well wrack only creates the power she must have something to focus it onto now how do you think she manages that
30682,oh no bigger than this
30683,critas the greek
30684,wrack gave him a clasp as a present she must have done and then she worked the same trick with davy
30685,well that was it
30686,well i cant see him or marriner accepting anything from wrack they dont trust her
30687,oh that wont stop her shell find a way
30688,wait a minute not until ive worked out some sort of plan
30689,its safer here far less likely to pick up my mind vibrations at this level
30690,i must find a way of staying on this ship
30691,to stop wrack winning
30692,you couldnt cope these creatures have vast powers thats why none of them must win to achieve further power would be a disaster
30693,we can but try
30694,well id hardly call it spying we were welcomed as guests given the freedom of the ship
30695,hes staying
30696,you dont understand it was his idea he wanted to stay come on
30697,wrack mustnt win the race hes stayed to prevent her
30698,well i think he wants to prove himself at least i hope so
30699,er im going to the wheelhouse
30700,the race is nearly over
30701,not yet
30702,theyve hoisted their moonrakers
30703,pirate sails for speed with those theyre faster than we are
30704,yes
30705,they can pass us any time they want
30706,why indeed
30707,no youve got it the wrong way round shes holding level with us shes moved in for the kill
30708,i tell you thats how she was positioned when the greek ship exploded she was lying level and when davys ship was destroyed practically alongside dont you remember
30709,we cant pull away from her shes got us where she wants us
30710,we must find the focus
30711,she must have done it she must have got it aboard somehow did she give you anything when we were on board her ship anything at all think
30712,it has to be here somewhere it has to be
30713,the point of focus without it the power she channels is useless
30714,the power of darkness
30715,well it could be anything probably a crystal of some sort so big perhaps could be part of a jewel a clasp the hilt of a sword
30716,come on      black guardian
30717,impossibility not at all
30718,because he didnt think of it theyre far more dependant on us than we are on them without us theyre empty nothings
30719,not quite dont forget turloughs over there
30720,if im to stop wrack winning i need my tardis
30721,oh probably did it the world of good come on no time to waste
30722,no
30723,ill be back i hope
30724,no wait the power youre tapping you think its under your control it isnt it will control you you dont understand what it is
30725,no turlough
30726,im afraid the captain cant be with us she met with a rather unfortunate accident both the captain and the first mate fell overboard i brought the ship into harbour with some assistance
30727,i leave the lies and deception to you
30728,im not ready for it i dont think anyone is especially eternals
30729,yes not now tegan
30730,theres nothing we can do
30731,i believe you
30732,youre missing the point enlightenment was not the diamond enlightenment was the choice
30733,anywhere in particular
30734,why not  ltback to the episode listing
30735,so it seems
30736,no
30737,march the fourth 1215
30738,yes it is
30739,i dont think so but something certainly isnt right
30740,just for a moment
30741,so he does
30742,lucifer
30743,without a doubt
30744,demons very odd indeed
30745,must you
30746,he even seems pleased to see us a king welcoming demons
30747,oh tegan 1215 king john of course
30748,well you could put it like that this particular shirt turned out to be the crown jewels but thats next year were still three months away from magna carta
30749,her name is tegan your majesty this is turlough and i am the doctor we are not demons
30750,your majesty if i may make so bold
30751,if this is trial by combat your majesty theres clearly a victor and a vanquished must blood be shed
30752,you are alive my friend
30753,thank you
30754,by eating lots of food
30755,hmm another way of keeping warm
30756,we were invited for a meal
30757,here put this around you
30758,do you know its just sunk in march the fourth 1215
30759,theres something very wrong here
30760,to take the cross as a crusader but he did that in london
30761,your history books
30762,no no too well documented
30763,i care
30764,he wasnt
30765,forced into signing magna carta he was as much for it as anyone
30766,do you
30767,well given the times he lives in yes but dont take my word for it youll be able to judge for yourself nobody forced magna carta from him he could have crushed that rebellion as easily as that
30768,we are not demons and weve done no harm to the king or to anyone nor do we intend any
30769,from an outer province
30770,yes well please believe that we are friends if youre in trouble i would like to help if i can
30771,yes yes we seem to have mislaid turlough how long has the king been here
30772,well could he be ill
30773,this sir gilles
30774,well i cant say i care for him much myself a french knight is he the only frenchman with the king
30775,could sir gilles be bringing some pressure some influence on the king
30776,when does he return to london
30777,your cousin was summoned to london
30778,today march the fourth
30779,what if your guest was not the king
30780,an imposter
30781,be vigilant my lord i suspect things are not what they seem
30782,no no and i ask you to trust me please
30783,thank you we would be delighted
30784,warmer
30785,we will
30786,a while longer then well go
30787,trust me
30788,stop fussing
30789,why didnt he react like everybody else why wasnt he scared and why are we his demons
30790,your majesty
30791,oh indeed no sire but surely such a fate is too mild would not boiling in oil be a more fitting end
30792,i thank your majesty but i was not suggesting alternative retribution my interruption was provoked by shock
30793,yes i was quite shocked at sir gilles monstrous lack of good taste
30794,in my view it is the worst possible taste to even think about following the kings quite remarkable performance one just cant follow that
30795,fortunately we are in england may i
30796,in case of accidents find turlough
30797,you escaped from xeriphas
30798,not at all you may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent
30799,you know i cant
30800,it is sufficient your majesty that your champion is disarmed
30801,sire i must intercede as victor i beg you to be merciful
30802,your majesty
30803,hes using that imposter to bring the real king john into disrepute and now he thinks hes trapped us into doing his dirty work for him
30804,see what i mean
30805,ready sire
30806,thats you
30807,your majesty does me great honour and my first action in this role shall be to arrest that man arrest sir geoffrey de lacy
30808,unhand him he is a man of honour lord ranulf is there a dungeon in this castle
30809,sir geoffrey do you know it
30810,i must insist you lead me to the dungeon
30811,no my friends attend the king i have no need of assistance your majesty sir geoffrey
30812,what
30813,in the interest of security where is the master most likely to house his tardis
30814,quite so
30815,youve seen another tardis release him
30816,quite so
30817,there is no sir gilles he is the master in disguise now you could call him a demon sir geoffrey you are no longer a prisoner release him
30818,a friend who wants to help the master has set up an imposter as king john of england
30819,to change the course of history
30820,he wants to rob the world of magna carta small time villainy by his standards but nevertheless something i intend to stop if at all possible
30821,to gain time and access to this
30822,then we must get you to london so you can warn him
30823,oh i can get you there much quicker than that
30824,yes but first we must bring it here into the castle
30825,no we must bring the imposter with us
30826,to expose the masters plan now come along  if you so much as touch this something very nasty will happen to you
30827,as a matter of fact i am
30828,the master of course
30829,back to square one
30830,im sorry sir geoffrey
30831,well not for sir gilles all the master has to do is set coordinates
30832,the same place he keeps the king
30833,so i see where was it
30834,safely on his way to london
30835,he should be there in a few hours
30836,the coordinates will be set get into the tardis
30837,your majesty seems in need of a doctor
30838,your work
30839,this is your king john
30840,impressive
30841,interesting
30842,and controlled by
30843,can anyone play
30844,its cunning of you to confirm the superstitions put about by the monks
30845,a gift
30846,the king turns the barons solidly against him he is killed in battle or deposed possibly in favour of king phillip of france he cannot therefore offer magna carta what do you think of it so far
30847,thus the foundations of parliamentary democracy will never be laid
30848,you cannot be allowed to alter the course of history even indirectly
30849,i shall have to give it some thought
30850,and you havent your compressor
30851,so do i
30852,he has a mind of his own
30853,and where will you take your toy next
30854,i may not need to you forget kamelion does have a mind of his own
30855,yes but for how much longer
30856,no
30857,you wont win not ultimately
30858,earth is a primitive planet you wont succeed so easily elsewhere
30859,youll never succeed
30860,safely in my tardis    ranulf
30861,yes yes im not a demon for nothing
30862,turlough
30863,let me present kamelion
30864,well tegan its a long story which appears to begin on xeriphas
30865,oh it will end with the master
30866,well hes without kamelion now and he wont be on earth for much longer i took the opportunity of leaving his compressor activated wont do his dimension circuits much good he could end up anywhere except where he wants to go
30867,i dont know
30868,why not hes harmless
30869,and a very fine mind it is too
30870,of course
30871,i apologise for tegans bad manners
30872,it seems youre outvoted
30873,as you wish
30874,im taking you home
30875,your own time i assume thats where youd prefer to be
30876,of course you do you dont have to pretend its a shame of course there were many wonders i wanted to show you
30877,the eye of orion
30878,but you wish to return home
30879,you dont
30880,all right you wont regret it i promise you
30881,no thats where were going  ltback to the episode listing
30882,2
30883,3
30884,2
30885,oh must i
30886,oh on target it seems you changed your mind about going home
30887,of course
30888,i believe you im just a little doubtful about how resolute youll remain
30889,yes indeed aboard the tardis it always does
30890,earth
30891,i promised to show tegan a little of her planets future were almost there you could let her know
30892,its my own fault i should er i should have changed it for a type 57 while i had the chance
30893,oh yes very close to earth in orbit above the atmosphere belt
30894,er slight hiccup in our time zones were too far advanced im sorry
30895,its a robot weapons system it seems to be scanning us  sentinel
30896,well its obviously thinking it over
30897,dont panic tegan now look just push this almost there  sentinel
30898,were out of control
30899,not if i can perform a materialisation flip flop
30900,yes well i admit it was close
30901,still in the same time zone
30902,i think so lets find out
30903,or submarine theres no motion it could be on the seabed come on
30904,yes of course a sea base
30905,oh thank you
30906,no no its a sea base a rather special kind of undersea military colony help me get this open would you armed with the sort of missiles that kill life but leave everything else intact
30907,very probably  silurian cruiser  outside the hibernation chamber
30908,around 2084
30909,absolutely nothing tegan there are still two power blocs fingers poised to annihilate each other hexachromite
30910,hexachromite gas its part of a sealing compound for undersea structures its lethal to marine and reptile life i thought they would have banned it by now
30911,no
30912,er yes yes the bridge repairs to the tardis will take some time better theyre done with the captains permission
30913,well if i remember rightly the command centres at the top of the structure
30914,no wait
30915,this
30916,yes it has to be done in sequence its whats called security we must find someone in authority and quickly come on
30917,well theyve sealed off the area back to the tardis well be safer there
30918,theyre between us and the tardis come on back this way  silurian cruiser outside the hibernation chamber
30919,you didnt read what it said outside
30920,try and start a diversion    silurian cruiser outside the hibernation chamber
30921,ive hotted things up a bit ive set the reactor on overload
30922,oh i shouldnt think so theyve got a couple of hours to sort out what ive done
30923,and in the confusion we can slip back to the tardis
30924,when i say run run run
30925,im so sorry
30926,youll live    silurian cruiser  outside the hibernation chamber
30927,what have you been eating
30928,yeah so did i for a moment wheres turlough
30929,yes all right first i must get you back to the tardis
30930,yes all right
30931,come along tegan
30932,shush
30933,my peace of mind please tegan dont argue now i dont need to tell you what to do should anything go wrong
30934,yes thank you
30935,i wouldnt if i were you well gentlemen it seems we have a problem
30936,so it seems perhaps its time for a little mutual trust
30937,well commander
30938,thank you
30939,when ive repaired her
30940,no dont
30941,yes you mustnt attack
30942,do so and youll regret it i know what that ship is
30943,im telling you you have no defence thats a silurian battle cruiser
30944,the race that ruled this planet long before your species evolved
30945,trust me you must try and make contact with it find out what they want
30946,i did try and warn you
30947,its a particle suppressor they turned your energy beam back on you they could have blown this base apart they certainly have enough reason to
30948,a long time ago i let them down then it seems ill do so again
30949,theyre honourable all they ever wanted to do was live in peace
30950,commander
30951,you cant fight them
30952,inform your people let them know whats going on down here
30953,friend or enemy its a distinction thats lost on the silurians i assure you to them youre all the same apedescended primitives an evolutionary error they obviously mean to correct
30954,let me go with them i know the silurians if i can talk to them we may be able to avoid bloodshed
30955,look on the bright side tegan
30956,the myrka
30957,im afraid the myrka takes quite a lot to impress
30958,tegan
30959,are you all right
30960,anything damaged
30961,turlough help me
30962,keep back dont let it touch you
30963,you too turlough
30964,get out
30965,im not leaving you
30966,whos talking about dying
30967,thank you so much
30968,brave heart tegan
30969,get ready mind your eyes tegan
30970,simple the charge from the myrkas body blew up the magazine
30971,yes temporarily
30972,well hopefully we can stop it before it does too much damage
30973,yes we all have an achilles heel tegan including the myrka now we must hurry i must speak to vorshak
30974,hes right commander your weapons are useless against it
30975,the bulkhead wouldnt have kept the myrka out for long
30976,if its any consolation i may just know how to stop it
30977,youve got nothing to lose
30978,after ive dealt with the myrka
30979,i need just one person someone in authority who can get things done
30980,it can only be heading for one place
30981,yes the bridge
30982,do you have ultraviolet converters on the base
30983,good now will the myrka have to pass this way to get to the bridge
30984,perfect i need a converter brought here
30985,ah set it up here
30986,now what do you think will the lighting circuit bear maximum converter load
30987,im planning to bring a little sunshine into the myrkas life    bulic
30988,the myrka is a creature of the inkiest depths or it was until the silurians tinkered with its biology anyway it has little tolerance to light and hopefully none at all to ultraviolet rays
30989,no tegan perhaps you should ask it nicely to go away
30990,yes almost
30991,look
30992,yes i think so
30993,very wise
30994,something wrong
30995,here it comes now well know if my theory was right
30996,just a few more feet
30997,all right tegan close your eyes make a wish
30998,very lets get back to the bridge
30999,obvious control the base and the proton missiles
31000,or destroy it
31001,the myrka is dead commander
31002,there isnt time for your petty feuds
31003,do you before long the silurians and the sea devils will have control of this base
31004,the technology of these creatures predates yours by millions of years if they intend to fire those missiles they have the means i assure you
31005,im going after nilson          turlough
31006,let tegan go shes of no use to you now killing us wont make your escape any easier you fire and every sea devil in the area will come running
31007,tegan make a wish
31008,goodbye
31009,how do you do im the doctor havent we met before
31010,ichtar
31011,yes i thought hed been killed
31012,you do not recognise me now but we are known to each other
31013,no wait wait please in an earlier regeneration you knew me as the doctor
31014,i know that you are ichtar the surviving leader of the noble silurian triad when we last met i tried to mediate between you and the people of earth
31015,may we speak
31016,so it seems why a civilised race like yours waging unprovoked war
31017,defensive theres no such thing when we last met your supreme wish was to live at peace with the other inhabitants of this planet now why change such an enlightened policy now
31018,what by actions such as weve seen here
31019,there can be no alternative to peaceful coexistence
31020,genocide when everything you silurians hold sacred forbids it
31021,youll trigger the war this base was designed to fight
31022,i would do as he says if i were you commander
31023,alive or dead they can still use your hand scan and while theres life theres also hope
31024,not so
31025,if my guess is right that little piece of silurian gadgetry will more than make up for the lack of a sync operator unless were able to do something about it
31026,do you intend to explode those missiles in space
31027,launching those things will trigger a holocaust youll destroy everyone
31028,to be masters of a dead planet
31029,i see
31030,what about us are we included in your final solution
31031,and the rest of these people
31032,commander
31033,excellent timing is turlough safe
31034,lead on
31035,impossible they need him in there
31036,not here not now well come back for him i promise
31037,the chemical store
31038,shush
31039,turlough
31040,the chemical store
31041,an alternative to this something less lethal that will do the job just as well
31042,oh yes all in all they were very forthcoming really they intend to launch your missiles and trigger a war to end all wars between your people of course
31043,hexachromite it does that to all reptile life
31044,and kill them
31045,i sometimes wonder why i like the people of this miserable planet so much the silurians and sea devils are noble races they have skills and talents you pathetic humans can only dream about
31046,no no and we must stop them
31047,something that will disable rather than kill
31048,yes i hear what does it mean
31049,yes all right turlough get the grill open preston fetch that pump we have to feed the gas into the ventilation system
31050,itll take some time for the gas to spread throughout the base
31051,i hope it wont be necessary at all if i can get to the bridge in time i may be able to reason with ichtar persuade him to abandon the missile run
31052,yes well this time ill have something to back my argument
31053,now i want you all to go back to the tardis youll be safer there whatever happens
31054,i must go
31055,a waste
31056,no no i must get to the bridge
31057,yes all right bring oxygen we may need it
31058,its working and quickly i cant bargain with ichtar if his guards are dead
31059,no wait your warriors are dying everywhere abandon the base
31060,abandon the launch theres still time to save your own lives
31061,who will replace you with you dies the last of the triad the custodians of your race what will become of your people then
31062,bulic turn off the gas
31063,the missiles are set to fire how long have we got
31064,whats the abort procedure
31065,well it must be done at once
31066,well i shall have to try
31067,oh you have a better idea
31068,no no there isnt time
31069,tegan look after the silurians give them oxygen
31070,did i succeed
31071,there should have been another way  ltback to the episode listing
31072,er no no no still some time distortion
31073,date time and place asked for how else could you visit your grandfather
31074,see
31075,unexpected aura for a quiet english village
31076,hes trapped if theres another fall hell be killed
31077,hello hello
31078,lets have a look around
31079,interesting
31080,then admire the craftsmanship seventeenth century probably on a theme of a man being chased by the devil must admit ive never seen anything quite like it before
31081,a ghost
31082,behave yourselves we have company
31083,too late
31084,if were trespassing i apologise
31085,thank you its a very impressive room colonel
31086,seventeenth century
31087,now calm down tegan im sure we can sort this out
31088,tegan come back turlough fetch her will you
31089,what is going on
31090,and youre celebrating that
31091,hmm i can understand why
31092,im known as the doctor
31093,no more than you are
31094,through the woods via the church
31095,hmm so id noticed
31096,do you know id love to but first i must find tegan and turlough and tegans grandfather i gather hes disappeared good day
31097,turlough tegan
31098,hello i saw you enter all i want is tegans bag what have you done with her i know you can hear me
31099,who are you im the doctor
31100,i wont hurt you
31101,show me
31102,what fighting
31103,what year is this
31104,sixteen hundred and forty three
31105,er yes will battles done
31106,yes i know
31107,will chandler
31108,ah well thats something were going to have to talk about      man
31109,theres been a confusion in time somehow 1984 has become linked with 1643
31110,psychic projections
31111,still a psychic projection but with substance
31112,an alien power source
31113,a projection too and at the moment a benign one
31114,yes ominous isnt it as is the fact your grandfather has disappeared i think its time i sought some answers
31115,the village
31116,come on will youre coming with me
31117,youll be safer in the tardis and dont argue will
31118,look at the others
31119,strange will come and see
31120,no no no something else
31121,the malus is just a superstition
31122,will tell me what happened how did it appear
31123,what did it look like like this did it look like this
31124,its all right its all right its all right
31125,stay close will
31126,no no just twentieth century men playing a particularly nasty game
31127,be grateful where do the steps lead
31128,yes tegan told me
31129,its metal
31130,its tinclavic
31131,the planet ragga lets get back to the church
31132,precisely what i said the tereleptils mine tinclavic for more or less the exclusive use of the people of hakol thats in the star system rifta you know
31133,well you take that sample to any metallurgist and theyll confirm it isnt from this planet
31134,never more so
31135,as part of a space vehicle
31136,well more likely a computercontrolled reconnaissance vehicle
31137,tell me was andrew verney engaged in any research concerning the malus
31138,thats what must have led him to the tunnel and the remains of the hakol probe
31139,i believe you will my sincerest apologies for ever doubting you
31140,thats precisely what will saw you see on hakol psychic energy is a force thats been harnessed in much the same way as electricity is here
31141,the thing you call the malus was on board the hakol probe
31142,no come and have a look at this
31143,yes
31144,look at it does it look familiar
31145,behind you
31146,yes its interesting isnt it
31147,psychic projection over here will
31148,well to all intents and purposes he is
31149,no will come back
31150,stand perfectly still
31151,i told you its a psychic projection
31152,we all learn by our mistakes
31153,more psychic disturbance
31154,i need to speak to sir george
31155,do you know anything about psychic energy
31156,then a quick lesson it can of course occur in many and varied forms but the type here capable of creating projections requires a focus point
31157,oh dear oh dear a medium
31158,yes a bit more complicated in this it isnt the medium thats creating the projections but the malus the medium simply gathers all the psychic energy for it to use and what at the moment is creating the most psychic energy
31159,the war games
31160,and who controls the games
31161,yes the trouble is i dont think he can have any idea of what hes doing the malus is pure evil given enough energy it will not only destroy him but everything else cheer up
31162,thats right
31163,long before the civil war started
31164,it requires a massive force of psychic energy to activate it when the civil war came to little hodcombe it created precisely that
31165,yes in every detail tegans grandfather must have told him everything he discovered he knows its the only way for the malus to be fully activated
31166,precisely the slaughter will be dreadful
31167,yes i know    tegan
31168,tegans right youre energising a force so irresistibly destructive that nothing on earth can control it you must stop the war games
31169,fluently stop the games
31170,dont try hes under the influence of the malus are you with us colonel
31171,not quite its a projection of the parent image probably one of several energygathering points
31172,oh it has no force yet
31173,im afraid you cant hurt it colonel it has no substance
31174,we must prevent the reenactment spoil it in any way we can reduce the amount of psychic energy being produced
31175,will there be guards for this procession
31176,make sure that tegan and jane get safely back to the church you can use the underground passage i must search for turlough and will and er good luck
31177,are you all right
31178,the last time you saw the malus
31179,the toast of little hodcombe
31180,thats nothing to what tegan would have done come on
31181,over here will
31182,come on theres still a lot to do
31183,this is all we need
31184,well if i can lock the signal conversion unit onto the frequency of the psychic energy feeding it i might be able to direct the malus
31185,well theres a remote chance
31186,ah perhaps you should close the doors
31187,its growing stronger
31188,it takes time excuse me colonel
31189,i know it senses what im about now everybody stay perfectly calm and still
31190,not quite but it can no longer fuel itself from the turmoil in the village
31191,ah i think its time we left this thing to die in peace
31192,save the greetings until later
31193,i dont know yet
31194,theyre
31195,the malus last line of defence theyll kill as effectively as any living thing
31196,they will in their own time were the malus last source of psychic energy itll make us sweat for as long as it can
31197,quiet will quiet
31198,not yet he isnt
31199,brave heart tegan
31200,the fight must have used a lot of psychic energy the malus needs to rest lets go before it recovers
31201,forget any codes of honour sir george might once have held hes now completely under the control of the malus
31202,not if theres another way
31203,sir george its important you listen
31204,youre his slave he only wants you for one thing
31205,the malus is here for one reason to destroy its the only thing it knows how to do
31206,without you the malus is helpless through you it feeds on the fear and anger generated through the war games once its strong enough it will destroy you
31207,listen sir george your village is in turmoil youre pointing a gun at a man whos a friend thats the true influence of the malus cant you feel the hate and rage inside your head think man did you have such feelings before you activated that thing
31208,no
31209,its all right will its all right
31210,the malus knows its lost its going to fulfil its programming clear the ground destroy everything it can come on
31211,enough to keep will here and level a church come along
31212,oh a living being reengineered as an instrument of war and sent here to clear the way for an invasion
31213,i dont honestly know i must look to see if theres anything in the computer about it
31214,ah yes yes it seems i was mistaken the malus was able to intermingle the two time zones for a living being to pass through must have had incredible power
31215,well that seems to be it well drop you all off then well be on our way
31216,ah well him too 1643 isnt all that far away
31217,probably it isnt unusual ive had a very hard day
31218,im being bullied coerced forced against my will ive had enough for one day
31219,all right just for a little while weve a great deal to do
31220,oh a noxious infusion of oriental leaves containing a high percentage of toxic acid
31221,true personally i rather like it  ltback to the episode listing
31222,not hat people are you either of you
31223,wear them much i mean i only do when i go out its silly to have this thing getting in everyones way
31224,well i have to start somewhere
31225,ah we must be on the outer limits the tardis has drifted too far into the future well just slip into hover mode for a while
31226,i had no idea we were so far out veruna thats irony for you
31227,veruna is where one of the last surviving groups of mankind took shelter in the great er yes well i suppose youve got all that to look forward to havent you
31228,all civilisations have their ups and downs
31229,yes thats enough turlough
31230,yes
31231,laws of time
31232,now we mustnt interfere colonys too new one generation at the most the future hangs in the balance now ive got another one of these somewhere put them side by side well have a pair
31233,impossible times up
31234,knowledge has its limits ours reaches this far and no further
31235,the tardis should be able to resist this sort of thing the consoles jammed
31236,gravitational pull
31237,dont panic
31238,its all right
31239,leave it to me
31240,i shall need some antiseptic and bandages
31241,to clean this wound
31242,it would help if we could see what were doing
31243,better hold it steady then hadnt you
31244,stop that would you is this the best you can do
31245,we need some proper lighting turlough the tardis ill need the portable mufield activator
31246,and five of the argon discharge globes
31247,yes youd better give him a hand tegan
31248,time for social niceties later better get started hmm
31249,yes good idea
31250,im not helping officially and if anyone happens to ask whether i made any material difference to the welfare of this planet you can tell them i came and went like a summer cloud
31251,perhaps you could ask them to move theyre rather blocking the air its interesting how often do you have meteorite showers
31252,yes the attacks
31253,really with whom
31254,not if i have anything to do with it how do you do im the doctor
31255,hello youve been keeping us unnecessarily in the dark mister range you didnt tell me you had a hydrazine steam generator      the metal panels are rusting brazen marches in and speaks to a young man lounging in a seat on an upper level everyone say hi to jeff rawle
31256,what about the colony ship must have been brimming with gadgetry
31257,what happened to it all
31258,hmm
31259,the tardis no no no probably just some spatial anomaly youre getting carried away again turlough one thing at a time wheres the mufield activator
31260,its behind the interior door yes of course excitation
31261,oh its risky but then so is operating in this gloom have you ever tried putting a higher voltage across one of these things
31262,yes there must be something on this planet capable of sustaining a steady voltage
31263,hmm someone else thinks this is their territory
31264,so you did nothing to provoke an attack
31265,dangerous surely out in the fields with the risk of bombardment
31266,thirty years your unknown invaders are certainly taking their time
31267,look im not really here at all officially and as soon as ive helped mister range with arrangements ill be on my way
31268,going yes coming no we were forced down
31269,im sorry we didnt know there was a war on at first we thought it was some sort of meteorite storm
31270,i think your shelters are totally inadequate and your warning system does nothing but create panic
31271,your population has already fallen below critical value required for guaranteed growth and youre regularly losing new lives i think and you did ask what i think i think your colony of earth people is in grave danger of extinction
31272,absolutely i wish you all the luck in the world unfortunately im not allowed to give you anything much in the way of help
31273,im sorry i was working out a way of getting some decent light in here
31274,if i had a spare millennium i might bring you up to date on time mechanics unfortunately we have this lighting problem and a ward full of people needing medical attention
31275,what again
31276,you know we can sort all this out in no time at all if everyone just stays calm now please come and see the tardis as an invasion weapon its about as offensive as a chicken vol au vent
31277,its lack of armaments can be an embarrassment at times just a minute get back
31278,oh well this way
31279,now whats this
31280,brilliant take it inside hurry along
31281,yes indeed in the tardis
31282,a swift exit i think weve had enough of this planet
31283,the attacks nearly over lets get out of here come on the tardis
31284,the tardis has been destroyed
31285,oh marvellous youre going to kill me what a finely tuned response to the situation
31286,be careful norna
31287,best do as they say well be safe as long as we remain calm now trust me
31288,in time if you let me investigate if on the other hand youre going to kill me youd better get on with it
31289,this wasnt what i had in mind at all
31290,oh just residual energy from the tardis
31291,what the precious rocks under the soil business well so would i whatevers going on here has put paid to my tardis
31292,if it is war and im not so sure about that then you and i plantagenet are in the same shell hole now does anyone know where these are coming from
31293,this rock analysis youve been investigating the whyfors i think you should be looking into the where froms mister range tells me you have a research room
31294,well if you want answers youd better unseal it
31295,youve been inside it
31296,the trouble is if these good people dont want us inside
31297,yes er careful with that thing
31298,good good i want to run a series on halides and silica and do stop waving that thing around
31299,i think this jokes gone far enough
31300,medical centre quickly
31301,delayed effect of a glancing blow
31302,tegan ah those wires
31303,rip them down
31304,jolly good now you can rip them down again damp cloths anything damp
31305,fibrillating
31306,are we ready
31307,now
31308,i admit it was touch and go for a minute
31309,not a word to the time lords
31310,after thirty years of bombardments yes i take your point
31311,the democratic touch eh
31312,now whats making you so vulnerable to attack is the thin atmosphere on frontios
31313,yes i have some theories about that and with your permission ill return to the research room and confirm them
31314,tegan
31315,then perhaps youll come with me mister range
31316,good see you later
31317,you know mister range if im right these socalled missiles of yours are nothing more or less than natural meteorites
31318,oh its unusual i grant you but one of the planets in the veruna system may have disintegrated with long term fall out
31319,i think he did
31320,what puzzles me is how it managed to crash in the first place with all that autonomous guidance on board
31321,what before the crash
31322,did they now i see why you call it the day of catastrophe
31323,ah the rock analysis they look like widmanstaatten patterns to me which would seem to confirm that
31324,turlough wouldnt risk an unsafe tunnel
31325,what sort of something
31326,you will mister range by staying here these sort of adventures depend on a wellmanned home base
31327,i thought you were supposed to be guarding the rear
31328,oh well a risk shared is a risk doubled come along
31329,listen  turlough
31330,turlough turlough
31331,mister range look after turlough im going on alone  medical centre
31332,so theyre tractators
31333,get her out of here ill hold them off
31334,out    medical centre
31335,oh no on the other hand with a touch of spin
31336,ah the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel
31337,no stay back
31338,some sort of gravity beam from the tractators
31339,oh i am lots of things nothing that quite fits the gravity of the situation
31340,wait until were closer
31341,better get out of here
31342,i suspect turlough can help us with that as soon as we get back
31343,against the wall there are more of them
31344,theres someone up there it wants to get down  medical centre
31345,well sometimes its easier to look for the way in and then work backwards
31346,oh but they arent
31347,hmm these chippings have recently been machined from these walls
31348,functionally advanced ones at that theyre creating an extensive and elaborate tunnel system oh insectlike they may be but theyre no ordinary insects they have highly refined powers of abstract reasoning these tractators must be very intelligent beings indeed
31349,youre never without a sense of direction while theres an air flow air flows from a to b usually you want to be at b or at a
31350,yes well i think you can forget about the tardis its probably scattered in little pieces across the whole of frontios yes
31351,the machine that did this
31352,tractators dead ahead
31353,no one is tegan so shush
31354,excavating machine or tractators take your pick
31355,not exactly theres a living mind enslaved in the middle of that lot
31356,its captain revere
31357,how do you do im the doctor oh er this is tegan
31358,then perhaps you wont mind telling us who you are
31359,hmm well you could be right gravis
31360,ah not any more than any other time lord you like travel
31361,yes id better put you right on one thing gravis the time lords didnt send me to investigate gallifrey operates a policy of strict nonintervention these days and besides frontios is completely outside our normal sphere of influence
31362,we mustnt take the narrow viewpoint tegan after all gravis and his friends were here long before the earth colonists
31363,slight communications problem here gravis my assistant hasnt been programmed in the ways of the world please forgive the naivety
31364,im terribly embarrassed about all this
31365,it must be the humidity causing the malfunction these serving machines are perfectly reliable on gallifrey
31366,oh you think so i got it cheap because the walks not quite right and then theres the accent of course but when its working well its very reliable keeping track of appointments financial planning word processing that sort of thing
31367,yes he seems dead enough
31368,ah yes if i could just inspect the linkages
31369,oh yes its very efficient gravis you certainly know your mechanics
31370,oh but it is for the bombardment isnt it gravis no accident that
31371,you know i guessed as much useful asteroid belt up there some additional gravity beams down here and youre knocking them over like ninepins
31372,oh not chance eh gravis
31373,their gravity beams again which explains why the colony ships systems failed before the crash
31374,oh they gave you ten years to establish yourselves and then they started making their collection
31375,im here to help you
31376,youll have to trust me when the time comes do exactly as i say
31377,i was rather wondering that myself
31378,yes yes ive been wondering why you need such a fine polish more of your gravitational engineering i suspect
31379,do you know i think i can guess gravis the tunnels act as wave guides youre concentrating your gravitational forces
31380,why the combined power would be astronomical
31381,no no no stay back
31382,well theoretically its highly complex practically
31383,no no just stunned well have to work quickly
31384,brazen
31385,give me your hand
31386,yes all in good time turlough
31387,well that sounds promising put the two things together we may find a way of stopping them
31388,i think its time we left come on
31389,well these arent tractator tunnels we should be safe here for a while keep watch that end
31390,yes theyre building a gravity motor
31391,hmm steer it through the galaxy under the power of gravity
31392,and breed infesting new planets nowhere in the universe will be safe from them
31393,no no tegan its too late follow me
31394,glad you could join us
31395,turlough plantagenet and i have been working out a plan
31396,oh i rather hoped they would be
31397,hmm apparently theyre not really dangerous
31398,well thats it now this should either sort out this whole tractator problem and repair the tardis
31399,or it wont i suggest you all get under cover    gravis
31400,yes quite id er id like to negotiate a surrender
31401,oh absolutely you can have it all frontios its unhappy occupants the lot i dont think its fair for us time lords to interfere
31402,why should we let a bunch of stuffed shirts deprive you of your own form of transportation hmm however primitive
31403,well in comparison to gallifreyan time technology of course but then what isnt
31404,what this oh yes well as i was saying you can have frontios all the fixtures and fittings appertaining thereunto and ill pull my tardis together and get off your patch
31405,well its not all here at the moment you understand its er its been spatially distributed to optimise the er the packing efficiency of er the real time envelope
31406,yes yes indeed well as you can see from this panel gravis i control all of the main tardis functions the time coordinates spatial coordinates all inoperative at the moment of course because the spatial distribution circuits are switched in
31407,oh no gravis please take everything else but leave me the tardis
31408,oh no gravis please i beg you spare me the tardis
31409,shush this isnt the time to disturb his concentration
31410,brace yourselves
31411,its kill or cure
31412,for you and me maybe but when the gravis really wants something
31413,with a bit of luck any moment the plasmic outer walls of the tardis will seal
31414,if your theory is correct turlough the vital link between the gravis and his tractator chums hold on
31415,oh no no but quite harmless and as long as we keep him isolated from the other tractators hell stay that way
31416,well the first thing well do is drop him off on some uninhabited planet  medical centre
31417,well thats that the gravis is safe and well on the uninhabited planet of kolkokron exercising his animal magnetism on the rocks and boulders
31418,alone but in good hands plantagenet speaking of which i know its not much but a farewell token
31419,oh no no far too much repair work of my own to be done besides time and the time laws dont permit it theres an etiquette about these things which weve rather overlooked im afraid
31420,yes quite dont mention it
31421,now listen you two if the time lords ever hear about our little trip to frontios therell be serious trouble
31422,oh theres nothing wrong with them
31423,no no no leave them theyre all right
31424,oh no this is something much more powerful were being pulled towards the middle of the universe im trying to pull against it
31425,i dont know i think were about to find out  ltback to the episode listing
31426,i cant free the tardis from the time corridor
31427,no too much turbulence hold on things must stabilise soon
31428,yes yes i know
31429,not if i have anything to do with it
31430,the right moment the time stress on the tardis varies greatly im waiting for the right moment to break out of the time corridor
31431,too late tegan hold on
31432,hold on
31433,for the moment are you all right
31434,well the instruments are still affected by turbulence but i think its 1984 london found it
31435,the time corridor i want to find out what all this is about
31436,such neglect a hundred years ago this place would have been bustling with activity
31437,come on trouble with you tegan you have no imagination
31438,what
31439,he must have come down the time corridor
31440,what happened
31441,whos controlling the time corridor
31442,relax im going into the warehouse
31443,perhaps they can tell us whats going on hmm
31444,look around
31445,recently fired
31446,why advertise who you are hmm
31447,turlough
31448,turlough
31449,turlough
31450,er yes im sorry about this a friend of mine wandered in here by mistake and were looking for him
31451,interesting you dont disbelieve us do you
31452,what have you discovered
31453,what have you found
31454,tell me alien objects
31455,a side effect of the time corridor
31456,dont harm her please shes a friend
31457,a dalek take cover
31458,aim for the eyepiece the stalk at the top of the dome
31459,quickly
31460,open the door
31461,stand clear
31462,while youre doing that id like a hand with the debris outside
31463,how is she
31464,who discovered these cylinders
31465,have you tried to open one
31466,it would be an enormous coincidence if they didnt
31467,you must get reinforcements
31468,ill come with you
31469,i wont be long i must get back to my ship
31470,i must find turlough
31471,no no no no there is isnt time turloughs on board the dalek ship
31472,be careful
31473,it was or at least the remains of one
31474,we have to find it before it tries to kill again
31475,true so why are you being so tentative in your search
31476,precisely thats why were searching the warehouse
31477,oh you wont mistake it the moment you find it itll try and kill you
31478,temporarily disconnected i would think
31479,nothing nothing go on with the search
31480,would you care to take a look how is he
31481,the dalek wasnt quite dead im afraid here take this
31482,we must get back to the tardis i have to find the dalek ship
31483,i need your help
31484,well you can take this opportunity to show me come along
31485,yes i know
31486,its bigger inside than out
31487,dont worry soon be over
31488,thats it ive located the dalek ship now i could drop you off at the warehouse when i collect tegan
31489,good man
31490,turlough
31491,this is madness the daleks wont thank you for capturing me theyll kill you
31492,without the threat of death youre quite powerless arent you
31493,however you respond is seen as an act of provocation i know the daleks of old and davros i assume hes about here somewhere
31494,do you mean it can get worse
31495,but not yet the daleks need my brainwaves intact dont they
31496,why isnt davros here i would have thought hed have wanted to see this
31497,so he is here
31498,what will you do with my duplicate
31499,oh i think it does ive grown rather attached to myself
31500,i assume my brainwaves are destined for davros you must need his services very badly
31501,superior it took you long enough to ensnare the tardis in the time corridor
31502,hmm but stien was more effective a living thinking being not some tinpot machine
31503,what
31504,are you all duplicates
31505,interesting i wonder what happened to the real you
31506,have the soldiers from the warehouse been duplicated
31507,its very clever would you care to tell me how its done
31508,hmm i thought not what about tegan
31509,shes harmless you must release her
31510,why
31511,why are you doing this
31512,no
31513,not staying till the bitter end how disappointing
31514,why do they take themselves so seriously
31515,get on with it i can do without your pity
31516,you ask it as though i have a choice
31517,i must have played truant that day or maybe we didnt go to the same school which school did you go to
31518,but you remember one of the amendments what was the first its very important i know its very important you remember too think man search the area of your mind the daleks have shut off resist before its too late
31519,resist
31520,quickly recite the amendments remember your past
31521,you must resist youre destroying my mind
31522,quickly release me
31523,well call them in here
31524,youll be safe in the tardis
31525,ill take that chance
31526,well dont just stand there come and help
31527,quickly come on
31528,earth
31529,why did the daleks rescue davros
31530,to kill davros
31531,i must davros created the daleks he must not be allowed to save them
31532,once before i held back from destroying the daleks it was a mistake i do not intend to repeat davros must die
31533,no
31534,all right  wait as long as you can but should the daleks attack you leave at once
31535,im sorry to have detained you
31536,ill say one thing for you davros your conversation is totally predictable youre like a deranged child all this talk of killing revenge and destruction
31537,but to what end just more suffering for those unlucky enough to survive
31538,until i walked through that door i foolishly hoped youd changed enough for me not to have to do this
31539,im not here as your prisoner davros but your executioner
31540,save your breath
31541,and compassion are they to be programmed for that
31542,but only to make the daleks more efficient killers
31543,for destruction
31544,which i do not accept
31545,outside deal with them
31546,i lack your practice davros
31547,no no you need medical attention
31548,no wait look i can help you
31549,im an imbecile    black
31550,well done
31551,the virus is only partial to dalek it would die once its done its work
31552,lunch has arrived for our friend here
31553,open the doors
31554,its over
31555,the earth is safe at least until the daleks find an antidote for the movellan virus
31556,you wont be able to invade earth  black
31557,the dalek ship has been destroyed
31558,the selfdestruct device on the space station
31559,no no stien i would think he must have finally decided which side he was on
31560,oh yes yes given time theyll all be free of dalek control
31561,er yes yes indeed come along
31562,i beg your pardon
31563,whats the matter
31564,you think i wanted it this way
31565,you want to stay on earth
31566,tegan
31567,no no dont leave not like this
31568,its strange i left gallifrey for similar reasons id grown tired of their lifestyle it seems i must mend my ways come along
31569,daleks i sometimes think those mutated misfits will terrorise the universe for the rest of time
31570,yes obsessed and depressed
31571,well we were together a long time
31572,no no no no we need to stop the spasming go and programme an alpha rhythm on the computer it should calm him
31573,its all right kamelion helps on its way
31574,contact who whats happening
31575,the spasmings stopped and hes fully conscious i just wish
31576,and why have you reset the coordinates
31577,someone has
31578,kamelion denies hearing any transmission did you get a precise fix on the signal
31579,oh well if it transmits again well get a fix on it with this
31580,a kouros late classical period its really rather fine id hazard a guess by a pupil of praxiteles
31581,hmm its a pity about the erosion but the overall effect is not unattractive like the marine venus on rhodes has this just been brought up from the seabed
31582,indeed but more of a mixed bag than you realise
31583,er nothing
31584,goodbye
31585,without a doubt well need two readings to pinpoint the spot exactly
31586,yes hurry i dont know how long therell be before the next emission
31587,the point of emission moved its odd its very odd indeed youre soaking wet
31588,hmm must be what was sending the signal now with a little help from the tardis computer we may find out exactly why kamelion set the coordinates to come here
31589,another moment and well know where the cylinder came from
31590,the tardis has dematerialised
31591,how did you get in here
31592,peri
31593,what girl
31594,er im not sure yet but i promise ill get you back to earth just as soon as i can
31595,bleak isnt it
31596,snap
31597,oh is that what its called
31598,very old by the look of it deserted
31599,we should get back to the professor and the girl
31600,peri
31601,theres no one alive on this planet
31602,lets get a move on the tardis computer may be confident the volcano isnt about to blow but instinct tells me otherwise
31603,why have you never mentioned your home planet before
31604,are you in trouble
31605,instinct and the fact ive never seen you so nervous before
31606,here and there
31607,im afraid not
31608,please forgive my friend he seems to have made a mistake i would like to know more about logar
31609,look i know it isnt polite for a stranger to take over a party but you really must get away from here the volcano isnt stable
31610,oh far from it the tunnel weve just come along is a vent for the volcano
31611,its the same route the molten lava will take to burn you alive i have a ship i can get you away from here think about it
31612,yes your trion settlers must have tapped the volcanic gas its a very complex control mechanism a seismic energy converter for powering a city
31613,in principle yes
31614,not from here you wont
31615,good
31616,possibly
31617,how do you do
31618,not a very hospitable planet at the moment
31619,er yes well what amyand said is right what you call the spirit of the mountain is fire itself and that fire will pour down onto your settlement destroying everything in its path
31620,i cant save your planet but i can get you away from here
31621,whoever your benefactor they provided you with a transceiver unit even if somewhat incomplete
31622,er its a way of communicating with other people possibly a more effective way of getting you settled on another planet the trions must have a form of colony or something eh turlough if you could get a message to the trion they could send a rescue ship
31623,what are you talking about
31624,turlough
31625,ow we need more power
31626,good good i need to speak to him weve a fullscale exodus to organise
31627,look be a good fellow were trying to help the volcano could erupt at any moment
31628,there is no outsider
31629,oh no
31630,the mans an imposter
31631,no
31632,i dont know where the girl is i dont have the comparator
31633,no
31634,you must believe me
31635,stop this
31636,oh dont you know allow me to introduce malkon chosen one of the sarns you see hes no outsider he doesnt recognise your chosen one and he doesnt understand the laws of the settlement
31637,hes not dead but let them think he is
31638,life must be very complicated for you at the moment not only are you a phony outsider youre not even the real master youre just a machine oh no no dont turn away you will accept my will i am the doctor and you are kamelion
31639,you are no more than the sum of your parts a mass of printed circuits
31640,you see he likes to kill he turned on your chosen one next time itll be you chief elder
31641,oh youll have a sign all right if i can break the energy link with the master this socalled will be nothing but a heap of spare parts youre on your own kamelion your power is weakening turning to silver a silver puppet jumping on a string string cut
31642,psychomorphic fringing nothing supernatural about that its an intermediate stage between anthropoid and robotic identity
31643,i must concentrate
31644,mustnt resist any distraction will allow the master to break through thats right kamelion servile slave bond broken
31645,the cave somehow its screening the thought control
31646,peri get back
31647,interesting i knew something other than rock must be screening me from kamelions mind
31648,one of the elders
31649,what good would that do we must get after peri
31650,come on
31651,how do you know malkon is your brother
31652,how does that make him your brother
31653,hes in severe shock there may be some damage to his nervous system keep him warm make him as comfortable as you can why fuel the cave with volcanic gas
31654,with all due respect to your fellow sarns i think the people who built this had a more useful purpose than burnt offerings to logar come on
31655,to find the master and his tardis do you know this ruin he spoke of
31656,dont you want to stay with malkon
31657,does everyone from trion have this mark
31658,something must have happened to the master for him to be using kamelion
31659,his present body must be good for a few years yet there has to be another reason
31660,no no no thats the masters tardis
31661,i can stop the master by materialising around his tardis
31662,were stuck the temporal stabilisers been removed another old trick of the masters
31663,hmm er i dont know yet someones been interfering with the tardis navigational system kamelion its been remoteparalleled with the masters tardis so thats how he followed us to sarn
31664,hmm oh its perfectly simple if this machine were working properly wed follow the masters tardis
31665,indeed although the effort would hardly be worthwhile hes still on sarn
31666,theres something the master needs on sarn if we could find it wed find him i think turlough will need some help
31667,a sign from logar what does he look like this fire lord
31668,how about that
31669,welcome gentlemen
31670,do any of you recognise this
31671,hmm must be some sort of control centre inside the volcano timanov have you actually ever seen logar
31672,where
31673,i wonder if thats what the master wants to be born again
31674,the seismic scanner somethings happening inside the volcano
31675,shall we gaze upon it too
31676,i dont think so that isnt an eruption
31677,i wonder if logar will help a sick time lord perhaps the master needs the blue flame more than the people of sarn
31678,no no no the hall of fire i want to analyse the deposit on the walls unless of course you can tell me what it is
31679,the control centres been maintained just what sort of interest have your people got in the stability of an abandoned planet
31680,when we arrived you expected to find trions here why
31681,if this is an abandoned planet what was your father doing here all right but if youre holding back anything that will aid the master our friendship is at an end is that understood
31682,hmm trace elements of numismaton gas very useful for an injured time lord who cant regenerate now why would he want the gas in such quantities
31683,even if i were in a better humour that wouldnt be funny
31684,no
31685,thanks to the master hes far better off here i must get back to the bunker and organise the gas flow
31686,theres healing power in one of the volcanic gases could be why the trions constructed the hall of fire some sort of curative centre i must release the gas flow strictly for medicinal purposes of course there we are
31687,why not if it saves malkons life bring him to the hall of fire quickly
31688,excellent
31689,theres still a residue of hot gas still to burn off
31690,more gifts from logar
31691,pure numismaton gas its quite safe
31692,logar had very little to do with it
31693,you were shot but you should be all right now
31694,amyand ill need your help as a guide we must get to the seismic control centre  amyand ill do my best
31695,why
31696,couldnt do better
31697,you are in trouble
31698,turlough how did your family become criminals
31699,but how could they possibly know youve absconded
31700,this must have been a very fertile planet
31701,oh dont be too hard on them its their technology thats maintained the stability of the planet
31702,they did their best the silver things that were seen on the mountain they were trion volcanologists attempting to control the eruptions
31703,well thats at an end the old orders gone forever therell be no more outsiders no more chosen ones
31704,with a leader like you amyand your people will soon advance
31705,all right come on
31706,quickly
31707,the seismic control centre its impressive the question is how effective keep an eye on him would you
31708,trying to slow down the eruption the masters interference has caused the seismic machinery to become unstable if i can override the automatic controller i can delay the worst of it
31709,i doubt it the masters already triggered a massive surge of numismaton gas in the planets core it that hits the surface it will disrupt the inhibition circuit altogether therell be devastation
31710,there we are that should hold back the eruption for a while now for the master
31711,fair exchange is no robbery the masters temporal stabiliser
31712,oh yes
31713,albeit in somewhat reduced circumstances
31714,ah youre experimenting with the tissue compression eliminator
31715,you made it too powerful for your own good
31716,and a very small master thats why you needed kamelion isnt it
31717,the scream in the tardis he even felt your pain
31718,no need to remind you what will happen if you use that thing in here
31719,he needs to move his tardis into the circle of flame when the next surge comes hell be surrounded by restorative gas amyand i want you to go back to turlough and give him this
31720,no were not amyand your turn to play logar
31721,he wont dare fire and risk hitting the control system
31722,i hope so what ive prepared will only work at close range
31723,just as you say
31724,im sorry too kamelion
31725,get back
31726,i dont know i just hope amyand get the stabiliser to turlough in time
31727,he doesnt have to its still linked with the masters it should materialise in the same relationship as the ruin
31728,its no good to us the tardis is the only way out of here hurry up turlough
31729,well done turlough quickly into the tardis
31730,er yes of course im all right
31731,im pleased for you
31732,better to go back while youre a bit of a hero eh
31733,oh yes your friends will be worried
31734,and you want to travel with me
31735,actually it was a question
31736,three months you say
31737,all right why not
31738,what
31739,almost anyway its fused silica and im not a pain heres some more now why would anyone come here
31740,these patches were fused by the rocket pads of a spacecraft too small for interstellar travel so it obviously came from the twin planet of androzani major the interesting question is why
31741,hmm sarcasm is not your strong point peri if i were you id stick ahha what have we here
31742,a monoskid you can see the deep furrow where it left the ship then the shallower one when it returned
31743,no no no you can see where the light track sometimes crosses the heavy one so someone came here with a heavily laden monoskid unloaded it somewhere and then returned to the ship
31744,er one moment looks as if the tracks lead to those caves over there
31745,ah blow holes
31746,now were near you can see theyre not caves theyre blow holes
31747,not to a speleologist and not if youre stuck in one of those things at high tide
31748,its a figure of speech you see the core of this planet is superheated primeval mud when its orbit takes it close to androzani major the gravitational pull
31749,hmm presumably why the planet was never colonised androzani major was becoming quite developed the last time i passed this way
31750,i dont remember im pretty sure it wasnt the future
31751,i tried keeping a diary once not chronological of course but the trouble with time travel is one never seems to find the time
31752,hmm oh natural phosphorescence theres a crystalline material in these walls its polished smooth as glass
31753,be careful not to slip oh
31754,its not edible by the smell of it its probably quite harmless
31755,yes well dont fall into any more hmm
31756,does it offend you
31757,safety precaution im allergic to certain gases in the praxis range of the spectrum
31758,if the gas is present the celery turns purple
31759,i eat the celery if nothing else im sure its good for my teeth
31760,gas carbines
31761,poison volatisers nasty little objects arent they there are enough hand weapons here to equip a small army
31762,i was wrong this dice is still warm
31763,boots coming this way quickly over here
31764,surrender
31765,couldnt we have a chair its been a rather strenuous day
31766,may i ask who you are sir
31767,well done sir i suppose you started in the ranks
31768,sir
31769,couldnt put it more plainly exactly how do we cooperate
31770,thank you
31771,sorry
31772,well i am generally known as the doctor my young friend here is known as peri that is perpegillium brown
31773,you know if we could just sit down and talk about this little misunderstanding in a civilised manner my young friend here has been complaining of pains in her legs you can see for yourself shes suffering from some sort of urticaria
31774,come to that i dont feel too well myself
31775,you take orders from a civilian werent you telling us you command federal forces here
31776,were quite innocent you know this is all a mistake
31777,afraid not
31778,doesnt sound any more enticing than any other form of death
31779,there was something very funny about that major
31780,chellak said they were fighting android rebels
31781,yes do try and speak english peri hmm
31782,yes thats another odd thing he had us paraded up and down in front of him then once hed seen us he seemed to lose all interest i find that rather insulting
31783,ive really no idea im sorry i got you into this peri
31784,yes i should never have followed those tracks curiositys always been my downfall hows your rash by the way
31785,me too that fungus obviously had some very toxic properties
31786,no its like a graveyard
31787,morgus said that spectrox was the most valuable substance in the universe i wonder what it can be
31788,ah not quite its going to worry me until i find out what it is
31789,nothing special were innocent weve had no trial weve had no opportunity to defend ourselves in short this is a mockery of justice
31790,sharaz jek i presume
31791,thank you
31792,no
31793,we travel a lot
31794,really well of course it would be fascinating to stay and talk but actually once weve rested if you could just point us towards the surface
31795,what is the matter
31796,try touching your toes thats it and again
31797,salateen weve not met him yet wheres he chained up
31798,thank you
31799,what do you say peri we can go on nature walks have picnics and jolly evenings round the camp fire
31800,thank you
31801,he means it will seem like forever
31802,well now we know why spectrox is the most valuable substance in the universe
31803,until the army take it away from you
31804,exactly this general is working to a plan ive seen his operations board
31805,so theyve already sealed you off to the north
31806,oh whats five years when youre having a good war
31807,and a raving egoist said my mind was nearly the equal of his incredible conceit
31808,not just morgus probably one amongst a vast majority ah salateen id know you anywhere im the doctor this is
31809,yes well ive been looking forward to this meeting
31810,well fellow prisoners how long have you been here
31811,thats right you see youre an old lag salateen you know the ropes
31812,and you probably know the best way out of here
31813,do you detect a certain coolness
31814,kill you ow
31815,cramp same as you had
31816,a spectrox nest if you mean a large fuzzy sticky ball
31817,oh marvellous sense of humour try not to get hysterical what do you mean were dying
31818,whats the cure
31819,what is a spectrox nest
31820,we havent seen any bats
31821,well dont keep us in suspense
31822,what else you said for a start
31823,this delightful process you describe so graphically how long does it all take
31824,cant waste any more time here
31825,how do these belt plates work
31826,something
31827,nearly perfect
31828,well if you have to go to arbitration i have had some experience
31829,emotional sort of fellow
31830,what happened
31831,more of a tennis player than a cricketer
31832,i see well peri i think its time we were toddling along
31833,well lets take a look
31834,hmm the androids are programmed to kill humans well my physiology is quite different the question is will it know that
31835,sorry peri no alternative just keep back
31836,hello
31837,yes well never mind its all over now ah what have we here this might be useful if we come across any more androids
31838,to find the queen bat
31839,well collect some oxygenators from the tardis come along
31840,first of all we need to find our way to the tardis
31841,peri peri where are you peri salateen peri peri
31842,life often springs these little surprises
31843,i dont know maybe they just liked my face
31844,i wish i knew
31845,i dont know we got into a shootout with one of your androids and then she disappeared
31846,i think shes with salateen
31847,if they have its round two to the army id say
31848,whats that
31849,my legs are going numb i suppose thats stage three
31850,i believe its called spectrox toxaemia
31851,yes
31852,why dont you leave me here to die
31853,are you afraid of intruders
31854,something wrong with his face or mine  morgus
31855,autohold off thats it now vertical descent pattern
31856,sorry seems to be locked
31857,stotzy well be touching down in a couple of minutes or more likely crashing down you see im a bit out of practice with manual landings so if i were you id find something firm to hang on to
31858,why
31859,not a very persuasive argument actually stotz because im going to die soon anyway unless of course
31860,unless of course i can find the antidote i owe it to my friend to try because i got her into this so you see im not going to let you stop me now
31861,sorry peri i cant make it
31862,not enough time
31863,jek how is she
31864,i know
31865,come on peri
31866,thats more like it
31867,no no peri dont give up you mustnt give up
31868,celery its a powerful restorative where i come from unfortunately the human olfactory system is comparatively feeble jek you know this cure professor jackij discovered
31869,its her only chance jek do you know where the queen bats are
31870,im going down now show me the route
31871,i can store oxygen for several minutes jek now you must do everything you can to keep her temperature down until i get back
31872,thank you
31873,its not your lucky day either
31874,is this death
31875,peri i see professor jackij knew his stuff good old jackij
31876,contains an antivesicant i imagine interesting
31877,what
31878,finished only enough for you
31879,too late peri going soon time to say goodbye
31880,i might regenerate i dont know
31881,adric
31882,youre expecting someone else   targetblankcolin baker
31883,thats three is in one breath makes you sound a rather egotistical young lady
31884,change my dear and it seems not a moment too soon  ltback to the episode listing
31885,well peri what do you think
31886,oh never mind about the clothes theyre easily changed what about me
31887,sorry im afraid i dont understand
31888,im not people peri i happen to be me
31889,natural metamorphosis a form of rebirth i call it a renewal and this time positive triumph i can sense it in every fibre of my being
31890,my outward appearance is of no importance whatsoever
31891,very well if you insist
31892,ah a noble brow clear gaze at least it will be given a few hours sleep a firm mouth a face beaming with a vast intelligence my dear child what on earth are you complaining about
31893,my last incarnation i was never happy with that one
31894,it had a sort of feckless charm which simply wasnt me
31895,sweet effete sweet sweet sweet huh that says it all
31896,my dear child stop worrying try to understand regeneration in my case is a swift but volcanic experience a kind of violent biological eruption in which the body cells are displaced changed renewed and rearranged
31897,hmm oh may indeed but each time with diminishing effect you have nothing to fear
31898,well if you find it so upsetting that would be the most sensible thing to do ah ha
31899,im always serious
31900,why ever not
31901,my dear that is what people said about beau brummell remember him
31902,and i dont
31903,hmm yuck
31904,vesta ninety five
31905,youll soon find out its a marvellous place for a holiday and you and i both need a rest i would have taken you to the eye of orion but er the coordinates elude me at the moment peri
31906,how did you come by a name like that
31907,indeed  one morn a peri at the gate of eden stood disconsolate who wrote that
31908,of course you dont you dont even know what a peri  is do you peri
31909,ill tell you a peri is a good and beautiful fairy in persian mythology the interesting thing is before it became good it was evil and thats what you are thoroughly evil
31910,no no not even a fairy an alien spy sent here to spy on me well we all know the fate of alien spies        lang
31911,i dont have fits
31912,i told you manic moments of no consequence they become less dramatic and less and less frequent
31913,dont exaggerate
31914,i must admit i am a little hazy
31915,oh dont be absurd
31916,what you say is impossible i have an inbuilt resistance to any form of violence except in selfdefence
31917,i dont upon my word you really are frightened arent you
31918,somethings wrong somethings very wrong oh no has it come to that regenerate yet unregenerate oh alas poor peri not for us the pleasures of vesta ninety five
31919,i am a living peril to the universe if this poor hive is to be cleansed theres only one recourse contemplation selfabnegation in some hellish wilderness ten days ten years a thousand years of what consequence is time to me i shall become a hermit and you child shall be my disciple i know the very place an asteroid so desolate titan three is where i shall repent
31920,titan three thou craggy knob which swims upon the oceans of the firmament receive this weary penitent
31921,hmm
31922,and why should you be sorry
31923,yes
31924,never more so ive no need to remind you now a hermit needs a hermitage you and i peri must find one
31925,far too good quite useless for contemplation no what we need is a cave some utterly comfortless place where you and i can suffer together
31926,because you have been chosen it shall be your humble privilege to minister unto my needs they will be very simple but nothing must be allowed to interfere with my period of contemplation
31927,i was speaking figuratively it shouldnt come to that come along were wasting time
31928,we must i must atone for what i have done
31929,huh the instruments say otherwise the atmosphere what there is of it is breathable
31930,i think we should find out
31931,of course its dangerous we could be blown to pieces at any minute
31932,then stay behind this is work for heroes not for fainthearted girls so no one could have lived through it eh well heres one who did you would have left one of your own kind to die
31933,yes small thanks to you poor pusillanimous peri what a pitiful performance
31934,what do you mean
31935,peri
31936,he was going to kill me peri
31937,peri
31938,quite beside the point for all you seem to care i could be lying dead at your feet this very moment
31939,easily but im not going to
31940,you never cease to amaze me all youre asking me to do is revive a man who had every intention of murdering me
31941,if its a question of his life or mine i certainly can
31942,oh a sort of policeman
31943,i wouldnt like to count on it oh all right have it your own way fetch the medical kit
31944,postoperative shock occluded wounds closed no internal haemorrhage this deep healing beams a small marvel great improvement on the old laser scalpel did you hide the powerpack to his gun well
31945,excellent oh the satisfaction peri knowing one has saved the life of a brave young man
31946,are you questioning my skill
31947,oh in that case the short answer is yes
31948,my perceptions sharpening i can sense some massive danger threatening the universe
31949,me
31950,words spoken in the sickness of transition now there is a sickness in the air i can feel the vibrations i cannot yet detect their source but it is there i am never wrong the life force itself is in danger of extinction we must find this evil and destroy it
31951,yes yes that is the problem its odd peri the indications are very strong i think the clue we need is here on titan three thats it of course the children
31952,he said something about children
31953,an interplanetary spaceman on a mission his spacecraft crashes he talks about children abducted children thats it peri children of great importance kidnapped by aliens brought here to titan three held for a kings ransom
31954,its nothing of the kind
31955,there wasnt but were here hes here things change peri
31956,hmm whats that
31957,that
31958,that
31959,a bump a bump a bump that is something which has no business on an uninhabited asteroid look at that symmetry thats no part of natures handiwork
31960,quite a distance lets get going
31961,whats a little radiation when we have a purpose a mission in life
31962,brave heart tegan tegan
31963,yes of course
31964,dont worry peri i wont be putting your life at any risk or mine either for that matter this is just a simple reconnaissance
31965,who oh oh the patient well dont worry hell still be here when we get back come along peri nothing ventured nothing gained
31966,the shades of night were falling fast as through an alpine village passed a youth who bore midst snow and ice a banner with a strange device
31967,i was only trying to cheer you up one of your primitive american versemakers longfellow wasnt it
31968,courage peri just follow in my footsteps apr�s nous le deluge
31969,would you rather i went round and knocked on the front door im a knight errant not an errant fool
31970,to our destiny
31971,peri quickly now what did i tell you listen
31972,the perpetual cry of all cowards we must investigate
31973,worse yes yes well perhaps youre right the purpose of reconnaissance after all is to gather information not to finish up face down in a pool on ones own blood especially blood as noble as mine weve found out what we want to know
31974,what
31975,yes yes of course but well children are such survivors besides we have only the words of a delirious man that there are any children
31976,an unthinking act of foolish bravado you know my current state of mind
31977,no peri discretion is always the better part of valour we should return to the tardis and rethink the situation
31978,whatever is it now aliens no no no no dont shoot its not my fault im just a poor pilgrim its all her fault mercy mercy mercy dont shoot me dont shoot me    mestor
31979,look im sure we can sort this out amicably
31980,look none of this is my fault im the innocent party its all her fault shes forever leading me off the straight and narrow
31981,and kindly refrain from addressing me as doc perpugilliam
31982,hmm oh my sincere apologies a momentary lapse i am now in total control leave everything to me
31983,but i can we are in no sense survivors we came to titan three of our own free will
31984,pilgrims in search of peace
31985,silence wretch
31986,yes and pilgrims need a place in which to meditate we were searching for a cave when we happened to stumble into your service duct
31987,my disciple
31988,a most devout young person now sir whoever you are i demand a full explanation of this disgraceful treatment now theres a face that floats upon my memory impossible im hallucinating as i live and breathe azmael you old dog
31989,oh forgive me old friend of course you dont recognise me ive regenerated twice since our last meeting look the twin hearts that beat as one im a time lord just as you are and in case you still pretend not to know who i am let me remind you the last night i stayed that last night when you drank like twenty giants and i had to push you in the fountain to sober you up
31990,thank heaven for a minute you almost had me worried there you dont seem overjoyed
31991,then why dont you
31992,earthlings children by heaven peri i was right
31993,i see you abduct these children deprive them of their memories bring them to this screaming wilderness and wont disclose your motives that hardly sounds in character
31994,oh whats time to us youre in trouble azmael grave trouble
31995,dont be absurd you and i together what an infallible combination
31996,what does that mean
31997,as prisoners
31998,poor fellow hes not a bit like that really
31999,no peri a few days at most
32000,thats what i mean it may take even me a few days well no time like the present lets get started
32001,its vital you dont interrupt the sequence
32002,all right all right im coming
32003,that i cant switch off
32004,not yet it means weve got to find another way out of here and very quickly indeed
32005,ill be brief i must be very brief that is known as a revitalising modulator it breaks down your molecular structure and puts it back together again a most refreshing process until now thats the only purpose its served i have improvised it will take you back in time
32006,ten seconds to be precise youll find yourself in the tardis
32007,absolutely in you get oh no wait a minute awkward i wont be able to see the computer clock when its my turn and i need to be able to compensate for the time factor so i arrive back at the tardis at the same time as you do your watch peri lend me your watch come on quickly now when i stand clear press the internal button do hurry peri in precisely one minute im going to be blown to pieces
32008,that stupid girls watch how i hate these hit or miss performances
32009,your watch stopped i overcompensated ended up in the wrong time zone ten seconds into your future
32010,you cared
32011,you know ill never understand the people of earth i have spent the day using abusing even trying to kill you if youd have behaved as i have i should have been pleased at your demise
32012,earthlings
32013,ah corporal lang how are you
32014,you were lucky to escape no one else did
32015,and we did not abduct the twins
32016,never mind about that now look do put that thing away will you if you ever hope to see them again your only chance is to come with us
32017,well at a guess jaconda
32018,not really
32019,i dont know
32020,no no no no no no no no no no no no look consider what we know azmael or whatever he happens to call himself need the genius of the twins he crosses galaxies to possess their minds he says hes no longer master of his planet but he wants to save his people and that i cannot help him to do so well if he really does believe such unimaginable rubbish he must be faced by some unimaginable disaster which has unhinged his mind well we shall soon discover what it is
32021,jaconda the beautiful
32022,oh no let it not be true
32023,half humanoid half slug part of jacondan mythology
32024,just look around you look at the devastation
32025,what else
32026,of course not so it wasnt a myth after all somewhere somehow their seed survived and now they have returned
32027,you think so
32028,i wish i could agree with you this was once a forest grove look at the trees not a trace of foliage the very bark stripped from the trunks and the soil barren nothing but these telltale tracks the slime trails of the giant gastropods i fear the evidence is quite conclusive
32029,im beginning to scare myself peri
32030,into the tardis i must think
32031,panic at any moment
32032,the palace
32033,and be killed
32034,me afraid
32035,you have a nasty habit of pinpointing the truth young man
32036,watch me
32037,well then let him go to the palace and hell know as much as i do
32038,oh is this another attempt to teach me compassion
32039,oh its all right for you youre young strong fit of limb youre confident in your mission your energys boundless youre highly motivated to success you even have a gun to enforce your will upon others but look at me im old lacking in vigour my minds in a turmoil i no longer know if im coming have gone or have even been im falling to pieces i no longer even have any clothes sense
32040,selfpity is all i have left
32041,as you wish
32042,well you didnt expect me to materialise in the throne room
32043,anywhere
32044,ill come with you
32045,you didnt give me much choice now look sergeant
32046,dont be smug with me now ive already explained my condition i may be behaving like a manic barometer but dont shrug off help when its offered you cant afford to
32047,sos most currency doesnt stop people spending money wisely
32048,hmm oh absolutely azmael showed me once this passage leads to the centre of the palace used to be an underground bolthole in times of danger seems to be clear shall we go
32049,this way come along ah there we are i dont know how old they are but they tell the whole story
32050,it was more truth than myth i think some dormant egg survived
32051,too long it seems switch off the torch listen
32052,the sound of giant slugs
32053,their gastric tracts rotting vegetables
32054,whatever is it now
32055,oh no i should have thought of that their slime trails harden like concrete only far faster
32056,easier said than done
32057,oh if you like but try not to burn your feet off
32058,now let me see we follow this passage to the end flight of steps up to the palace hall doorway at the left just before the top yes thats it private doorway to the back of his laboratory thats where hes bound to be
32059,what
32060,me once i can get away from this fool will you hurry up
32061,well its not good enough oh look what youve done you stupid girl youve ruined everything
32062,of course it was your fault sheer carelessness switching off the torch when you did dont argue with me
32063,manic depressive me
32064,right thats it im off
32065,calm down calm down calm down the fate of a whole planet is hanging in the balance and he tells me to calm down
32066,oh fend for yourselves
32067,still bullying children eh
32068,a thousand murrains on your head
32069,i apologise however i still would like to know why you tried to murder us
32070,oh that doesnt matter now i think youd better tell me whats going on here
32071,you really intend to put it into operation you know what will happen dont you
32072,this is not a risk azmael this is doomsday one tiny error in your calculation youll blow a small hole in the universe
32073,peri theyll kill her
32074,leave me i must go to her
32075,but i must help her
32076,no peri
32077,how the very core of my being is on fire with guilt and rage how is he
32078,peri youre alive
32079,its debatable who the fool is if you intend to blow up this corner of the universe
32080,not at all in fact if i can hold my mind together i might even be able to help you
32081,well moving planets around is not for amateurs you know i mean the twins may have the mathematical skills but i have the empirical knowledge the practical experience that can guarantee success i mean one tiny error in your calculations the planets youre trying to shift could fly off in any direction
32082,you should know i can sense your presence in my mind
32083,im secretive by nature besides if you were to learn everything too quickly youd have no reason to keep me alive
32084,good heavens you are rather hottempered
32085,ive agreed to help you
32086,with this ridiculous scheme of mestors
32087,and how do you think the lord mestor would feel about that
32088,embolism isnt it let me tell you little tiny bubbles go very well in champagne and purgatives noma but not in the blood
32089,have you got fowl pest
32090,how does mestor plan to bring the other two planets into the same orbit as jaconda
32091,well how will he stabilise jaconda three planets in the same orbit will exert enormous gravitational pressure on each other
32092,very neat
32093,what
32094,of course im all right im certainly all right its the situation thats all wrong
32095,both the outer planets are smaller than jaconda
32096,well so is the consequence if theyre brought any nearer the jacondan sun
32097,your mind was on other things my friend
32098,a matter of simple physics the gravitational pull of the sun on jaconda is more or less consistent yes
32099,the outer planets are smaller place them where jaconda is how long do you think theyll last
32100,of course
32101,i dont know but theres method to his madness of that im certain in the meantime carry on with your calculations we dont want to arouse mestors suspicions
32102,then who am i
32103,see it more as a mental stroll in a park of psychic tranquillity
32104,who oh oh very good excellent ten out of ten alpha plus
32105,is it possible to get into the hatchery
32106,i sense the answer is in there azmael
32107,of course
32108,of course these eggs are dry and rubbery lets see whats inside a laser cutter i must have a laser cutter
32109,i dont know but somethings wrong
32110,it should at least have scratched the surface
32111,how indeed
32112,precisely what its supposed to do only it isnt anything like hot enough yet
32113,are these all the eggs
32114,so many ah it all begins to make sense
32115,they were designed to withstand the temperatures of an exploding sun
32116,mestors colonisation is not of this planet but the universe
32117,its so simple its mindboggling of course it could work
32118,then deal with them you are supposed to be an interplanetary pursuit officer
32119,deal with mestor
32120,i am fully alert and ready for action
32121,better we die in harness battling against the odds than die in fear finding menace in our own shadows
32122,can you carry them in your head
32123,then destroy all the notes youve made
32124,good drak you go back to the tardis with the others
32125,mestor
32126,theres no time to waste check the corridor
32127,such a nice girl hope i see her again
32128,yeah
32129,ah there you are ive been looking for you
32130,im not having your sluggy eggs spread all over the universe causing havoc nor will i allow you to destroy what was once a very beautiful planet
32131,did i threaten him did you hear me threaten him
32132,watch it mestor
32133,im the one whos doing the warning now will you give up this nonsense
32134,then take the consequence
32135,no just a rotten shot
32136,indigestion or is it bad news
32137,perhaps your plan to recapture the twins has failed
32138,be careful of lieutenant lang hes been dying to kill someone ever since he got here and after all you did destroy his entire squadron earthlings have an unquenchable thirst when it comes to revenge
32139,oh thought wed come to that embolism time is it oh dont tell me my blood will bubble like a raging stream i will beg to die and in so doing i will crave your indulgence and forgiveness
32140,good because in my time i have been threatened by experts i dont rate you very highly at all
32141,ha i dont blame you
32142,you take over my mind ha it would be like throwing a pebble into a lake it will sink without trace
32143,a jacondan mind maybe but i am a time lord
32144,indeed
32145,thats not fair hes an old man
32146,well why dont you try
32147,we must mindlink together we can destroy him
32148,i can contain him
32149,you cant youve used up your allotted number of lives
32150,you should have left him to me
32151,but to throw away your own life
32152,oh you had so much to give you were the finest teacher i ever had
32153,azmael azmael i shall miss you old friend i shall indeed
32154,sorry about that
32155,of course not
32156,do i look otherwise
32157,ill take you all
32158,wait a minute i remember you youre the chamberlain
32159,i dont like you
32160,then i suggest you start walking right lets get you and the twins back to earth
32161,theyll survive
32162,well certainly not that thing neither will azmael hes dead
32163,theyre quite capable of looking after themselves listen
32164,as you wish although i think youre mad
32165,that i can believe
32166,to whom
32167,you may not believe this but i have fully stabilised
32168,you seem to forget peri im not only from another culture but another planet i am in your terms an alien i am therefore bound to different values and customs
32169,at such a cost i was on the verge of becoming neurotic
32170,and i would suggest peri that you wait a little before criticising my new persona you may well find it isnt quite as disagreeable as you think
32171,whatever else happens i am the doctor whether you like it or not  ltback to the episode listing
32172,here we go again
32173,something i should have done a long time ago
32174,the tardis when working properly is capable of many amazing things not unlike myself one of its functions is that it can change shape to blend perfectly with its surrounding environment
32175,not yet you dont i wonder why i didnt do it before
32176,unstable unstable unstable this is me peri at this very moment i am as stable as you will ever see me
32177,you must forget how i used to be im a time lord a man of science temperament and passion
32178,yes yes that too but not unstable this is the real me peri but dont be afraid i wont hurt you i promise
32179,rest nonsense rest is for the weary sleep is for the dead i feel like a hungry man eager for the feast now weve both spent too long in the tardis we need a change where would you like to go
32180,for you somewhere restful i think im sure after the bleakness of jaconda you could do with a sight of green hills rolling countryside
32181,i know the very place
32182,just hold on
32183,keep hold
32184,i must have crossed a wire
32185,really at least the tardis isnt damaged
32186,be grateful if its shell had been punctured youd find it very difficult to breath in a vacuum
32187,o child of little faith
32188,comet nine oblique one two oblique four four to you halleys comet
32189,in your suns solar system in the year that you would calculate as 1985 i was in fact taking you to earth
32190,ungrateful wretch
32191,a little gratitude wouldnt irretrievably damage my ego
32192,absolutely not
32193,not at all i have perfect rapport with this machine
32194,of course i do but you have nothing to fear i promise you
32195,thats nonsense
32196,no its a distress signal
32197,doh listen that is an intergalactic distress call
32198,cant be far the signal is very strong
32199,im not certain strange its coming from earth in 1985
32200,possible it is desirable it isnt i think when we arrive we should investigate
32201,this looks familiar
32202,scrap yard
32203,london
32204,hmm
32205,oh shes probably thinking about it come on lets find out where those signals are coming from
32206,neat
32207,well she hasnt done it for a long time shes out of practice
32208,its more a question of having organised a surprise party and forgotten who its for
32209,thats a horrible simile
32210,merely slips of the tongue
32211,i called you zodin did i oh they dont make villains like her any more a woman of rare guile and devilish cunning
32212,perhaps youre right my mind may be playing tricks on me you know i havent thought about zodin for years
32213,thats it its unoccupied
32214,oh yes im a fool of course i am thats precisely what i would have done
32215,come on
32216,look susan
32217,precisely the poor thing may be trapped here terrified if it is i can do something about it
32218,im not sure
32219,of course there is somewhere
32220,it is but the source of the signal is transmitting from some elsewhere
32221,i also detected several weaker signals going into the house our alien is being ultracautious hes bouncing the signal off several relay points around london it could take days to find out where its coming from
32222,hmm you are brilliant peri absolutely brilliant if the signal is being relayed to prevent detection then the house has to be watched
32223,exactly lets find our alien before he has time to vanish
32224,im sure he will probably sitting there all of a dither waiting for us to arrive
32225,i was certain id fixed it
32226,not now peri
32227,ah how do you do constable
32228,im not blind peri you look uncomfortable in that hole let me help you out
32229,i believe you
32230,i wouldnt dare you did very well im impressed
32231,hes er having a little liedown
32232,i think you are correct in that assumption thank you
32233,the bottom of that pit has been dug out i think it leads to the sewers come on
32234,you saw the signs and scuff marks on the bricks
32235,no theyre recent i have an instinct for these things
32236,it is an interesting city
32237,hmm youll find this route more memorable
32238,i heard me someone may be hurt they may need our help come along
32239,his necks been broken
32240,one moment im thinking
32241,hmm yes yes youre absolutely right but first lets find some hard evidence
32242,thats just the victim the police will be more interested in the perpetrator of the crime this way
32243,dont do that
32244,im not scared i was thinking what do you want
32245,with gratitude after all i do have the means of getting it off this planet
32246,well if it doesnt i shall beat it into submission with my charm come along
32247,at the moment suffice to say that this is peri and i am known as the doctor
32248,i found it
32249,put another way its former owner will have no further use for it
32250,a sonic lance how much longer do we have to maintain this ridiculous posture weve told you all we know
32251,can you prove that
32252,peri gun
32253,ive already told you i am known as the doctor im also a time lord from the planet gallifrey in the constellation of kasterborous
32254,thats debatable but im also telling the truth the question is are you
32255,and what are you doing down here
32256,youre beginning to annoy me
32257,try me oh ive had enough of this shoot him peri
32258,yeah shoot him
32259,handful of heartbeats to a time lord
32260,lytton tall lean dark dark wellspoken the sort of man who might shoot his mother just to keep his trigger finger supple
32261,commander lytton late of the dalek task force
32262,i should have guessed when we were attacked by those uniformed policemen howd you get onto him
32263,just get on with your story
32264,just as if hed come from another planet
32265,but you were curious you wanted to know more about him an act we may all live to regret not only is he from another planet but hes also a professional killer there
32266,would you mind peri
32267,back to the tardis its a bit overcrowded down here
32268,this is the right way
32269,bear left what is it
32270,a cyberman
32271,a particularly unpleasant alien life form
32272,we can at least try
32273,shake it up a little
32274,wait watch and learn
32275,first we need a plan this way
32276,dont leave the pit till i get there  peri
32277,come on
32278,careful there may be others
32279,if you want my cooperation she must live
32280,not anymore you dont in precisely twenty seconds you and it will cease to exist
32281,how do i know you wont cheat and change your mind
32282,im not sure thats enough
32283,i thought he was destroyed
32284,where is he now
32285,i see
32286,this is bad news very bad news how can they have discovered the laws of time
32287,so they only have one ship
32288,doesnt make it any less depressing how do you know what happened on telos
32289,unfortunately yes the last time we met he was working for the daleks
32290,not at all ive never found it difficult to despise people like you
32291,more likely a spy
32292,upset the navigational control if i can distort the coordinates by just a fraction of a degree
32293,not quite
32294,uh huh adopted planet youd have liked telos peri in the old days when the cryons were in residence they were the indigenous population till the cybermen wiped them out
32295,oh for heavens sake man the universe is littered with unpopulated planets
32296,well thats hardly an excuse
32297,refrigeration
32298,not when you build refrigerated cities the way the cryons did they had a genius for it mind you they had to they couldnt live in temperatures above zero
32299,hibernation they were running out of power they needed to rest and whatever you may say lytton they could have built their own hibernation plant and refrigeration chambers anywhere
32300,youre enjoying this
32301,it blew up
32302,take no notice of him hes just trying to unnerve you your planet survived the attack
32303,1986
32304,you could put it that way
32305,how can i do anything im a prisoner
32306,not to that extent even i have to be careful
32307,and that would please you look dont worry earth survived with minimal damage its an historical fact
32308,mondas had a propulsion unit a tribute to cyber engineering though why they should want to push a planet through space ive no idea
32309,go with him this is no time to be difficult
32310,telos
32311,what have i done
32312,a little disagreement with our tin friends
32313,not half as bad as i feel
32314,nothing much
32315,id forgotten how big they were
32316,yes i suppose the atmosphere is rather rancid
32317,really
32318,yes i wonder why
32319,you know far more than youre saying
32320,why
32321,run peri
32322,hello im the doctor
32323,i thought the cybermen had destroyed the cryons
32324,do you mean depressed or cold
32325,not for long i hope i wont last half an hour in here its freezing
32326,enjoy me while you can i hope not to be around for too long
32327,really could also have something to do with the lack of support on the part of their cellmate
32328,it seems your people have done quite a lot already i assume you are responsible for the stench of death everywhere
32329,so would i especially now that they can time travel
32330,they have a ship
32331,thats reassuring
32332,i rarely do
32333,well tell me gently
32334,they cant its against all the laws of time
32335,mondas oh i think my bloods beginning to congeal are you sure about this
32336,how do they intend to destroy earth
32337,it would still take rather a large bomb
32338,halleys comet
32339,indeed it will itll also bring about a massive change in established history the time lords would never allow it
32340,well if they are theyre taking their time about it for a start why wait a minute no nos not me  you havent manoeuvred me into this mess just so i can get you out of it it would have helped if i had known what was going on
32341,yes and at the moment a rather angry one
32342,oh but surely it must have occurred to you that if mondas hadnt been destroyed the cybermen would never have come here
32343,what is it
32344,how warm does it have to get before it becomes unfriendly
32345,so you said and so are we
32346,first things first how much of this stuff do we need to destroy the guard
32347,now youre sure this will explode on contact with warm air
32348,wait watch and learn
32349,when they learn about this theyll kill you
32350,well theres not much power left in this lance and that stuff is very cold it may not generate enough heat
32351,hello im the doctor
32352,well thats not very friendly
32353,well there at least we agree how many cybermen are inside the tardis
32354,then we must find out
32355,cybermen have an inbuilt distress signal
32356,the signal is mechanical not organic there may be enough power left in this battery to transmit
32357,a reaction from those inside the tardis the cybermen have one weakness theyll react to the distress of their own kind when i was a prisoner in cyber control i met a friend of yours
32358,if she isnt now she soon will be shes at the moment the living detonator of a bomb that could go off at any second and kill us all
32359,are you ready
32360,there are two of them this way
32361,what about you rost
32362,hmm
32363,that should make him happy
32364,for you
32365,wheres he likely to be now
32366,ill see what i can do good luck
32367,thats right and im just beginning to find out about you
32368,i did why didnt you say something
32369,i can help you hang on
32370,im the doctor ill tell you if its irreversible or not now just hang on
32371,i know
32372,i dont think so
32373,i must help him
32374,i cant just leave him
32375,why didnt he say something
32376,i meant on a personal level i dont think ive ever misjudged anybody quite as badly as i did lytton  ltback to the episode listing
32377,thats it
32378,i havent told you what ive done yet
32379,what is the matter with you
32380,does it what do you mean
32381,i have never said i was perfect
32382,that was an unfortunate accident
32383,have you finished perpugilliam
32384,its a good thing i like you
32385,what more do you want ive cleared up as you requested ive stabilised the chameleon circuit
32386,a police box i think
32387,we have never materialised as nelsons column
32388,its a good thing im a tolerant man because sometimes you push me too far
32389,intolerant
32390,because
32391,shush theres something amiss in the power transmission system
32392,its the one area i didnt check
32393,it seems that function is about to become defunct too
32394,the problem is peri we are faced with a conundrum wrapped up in a dilemma
32395,we could very well be stuck in a limbo of space and time
32396,eternity
32397,thats interesting not to say arresting
32398,neither here nor there
32399,somewhere lets see
32400,midway between cetes and sculptor materialised into actual and temporal void
32401,this is the one problem the tardis cannot overcome like all things in the universe she cannot move without power and energy
32402,its all right for you peri
32403,youve only got one life youll age here in the tardis and then die me i shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent
32404,what is it
32405,oh yeah started reading that once
32406,huh i know perfectly well what category of disaster has befallen us
32407,no no not this time might as well confirm my diagnosis something to pass eternity with i suppose
32408,oh yeah probably some vestigial power passing through to the transitional elements which would mean
32409,yes hold that dont lose the place and dont give up hope not yet
32410,where else
32411,zee oh zed
32412,well thats as it should be the power conversion factor is stable so why arent we receiving full transmission of that power theres a possibility may i
32413,let me see yes we might well try hold that
32414,with the last vestiges of our emergency power booster enough for a limited flight no further the thing that depresses me most of all is that the transitional elements have lost the capacity to generate orbital energy and should be must be replaced
32415,no time at all if we can obtain enough zeiton7 to reline the transpower system the tardis will be like well as she was no its not the fitting thats the problem zeiton is a very rare element its only to be found on one planet
32416,hmm oh i suppose if we use the emergency power booster to bypass the failing circuits we could just reach the planet of varos in the constellation of cetes question is when if we miss their mining era well be stranded for evermore
32417,with distorted readings from a nearby power source
32418,lets go and ask him
32419,not interrupting anything
32420,quite right

32422,let me have it come on give it to me now
32423,thank you
32424,peri pull his away from the wall
32425,thats it right hold close your eyes and wish for luck here we go
32426,lets get back to the tardis ill explain there
32427,then again retreat another way might be a more viable idea
32428,help me turn this round
32429,what is this place
32430,lets create a little difficulty for our uniformed friends shall we
32431,youre the only person weve encountered so far who hasnt tried to destroy us help me pull pull
32432,if you insist
32433,i will explain id sooner leave whatever this place is and get back to the safety of the tardis er ship
32434,first i want to know what this place is
32435,starvation but varos has precious mineral deposits zeiton7
32436,i wouldnt say no to a little
32437,all these cameras do they feed pictures from here into every home
32438,if we can get back to the tardis we can get away from here much more easily
32439,tardis
32440,not yet lets see what this purple passage has to offer
32441,peri this is no time for casual conversation  peri
32442,of course thats it close your eyes
32443,close them now right now all take hands thats it now follow me its just an illusion
32444,it might in fact ah ha there we are
32445,we thought it was that little fly was enlarged by the effect of the purple zone on our visual cortex once the purple light was eliminated we were restored to a proper sense of proportion interesting
32446,who loves to watch
32447,oh lets see what else this fun palace has to offer
32448,real or imaginary just as loathsome the niff at least is not an illusion or is it
32449,or is that exactly how they would expect us to reason one way to find out
32450,just here
32451,it most certainly has
32452,well it cant be far away hmm come on
32453,check down there
32454,peri
32455,i had the most peculiar dream
32456,i thought you were my mirror image until i realised that i wasnt holding a gun
32457,a student of science much interested in primitive nuclear technology
32458,a waste of effort i assume there will be something novel by way of spectacle to mark my return to that state
32459,after you
32460,all very traditional the whole ghastly ritual to be played out
32461,no need to ask for whom
32462,a fourth noose for peri is a more likely explanation but why isnt she in here with us
32463,why are they so anxious to eliminate you
32464,without trial
32465,hello
32466,so would i have been if id asked for one
32467,truth is a very flexible commodity here on varos peri as long as things appear truthful thats all that matters
32468,why to help varos realise the wealth of its potential what else
32469,one request
32470,who is he why is he here
32471,zeiton ore zeiton7
32472,i see thank you
32473,for the moment
32474,do you often employ the noose trick
32475,i noticed your cameras werent broadcasting a real execution would have been broadcast
32476,i will discuss nothing reveal nothing until i have proof that peri and areta have been released unharmed from the cell mutation experiment
32477,well where are they
32478,what
32479,there was plenty of time to halt the experiment
32480,who controls the transmutation experiment
32481,only probably
32482,that beam that radiates what source of energy is it derived from
32483,how can the process be reversed
32484,and you call yourself a research scientist
32485,turn off the machine they might still be restored to normality
32486,who decides the authority of command
32487,but it can be changed
32488,do you still experiment on your own person
32489,but in the past you exposed yourself to much danger i think
32490,your mask
32491,gun thank you
32492,no time
32493,not now the odds are unpredictable with the control centre damaged we may yet have an outside chance we must move on
32494,no take them with us
32495,can you move peri try you are peri peri
32496,i am the doctor and you are peri perpugilliam brown
32497,its a question of reimprinting their identities of establishing again who they are
32498,can you walk peri come on try
32499,yes but walking is all thats required for now come on peri walk
32500,cover me ill get the girls
32501,where are we
32502,i wonder why weve been allowed to progress so far into the dome without being apprehended
32503,could that be where the escape exit would be
32504,what are we waiting for i must be cautious from now on i believe the mind games and jolly tricks are over what were entering now could be the area of most dangerous ordeal    chief
32505,no be gone you are shadows insubstantial ghosts we are real you are not
32506,i dont know his necks swollen as if to burst poison perhaps
32507,this is no time for speeches jondar
32508,run
32509,i noticed a pile of bones back there i think we were on their dinner menu
32510,the best we can do you think you could attach this string to that clump of vines without killing yourself
32511,just a passing fancy
32512,an excellent scenario not mad about the part
32513,now
32514,poison one touch and
32515,something like that
32516,really from where
32517,the ways of the ruler are fraught with uncertainty are they not sil
32518,i think he needs more than water peri eh
32519,oh come peri wheres your sense of justice
32520,i think well leave the varosians to work out their own idea of justice peri
32521,well er a little zeiton7 would be quite useful not to say essential
32522,thank you goodbye
32523,now you see me
32524,the orthoganal readings havent altered good splendid new elements on linings on the orbital transmission thanks to the governors generous supply of zeiton7 still now the whole of varos knows its more precious than gold you can understand their generosity i suppose
32525,oh yes absolutely disappointed
32526,you all right
32527,as long as you stay away from millet and cuttlefish  ltback to the episode listing
32528,the dress is too large
32529,isnt that the accepted meaning great synonym for large
32530,of course great can also denote a high degree of magnitude someone elevated to power
32531,mmm never felt better
32532,what
32533,oh i know whats going on were being manoeuvred off course
32534,malfunctioning malfunctioning malfunctioning after all the work ive done on it
32535,indeed you did it was the wrong question
32536,the time coordinates are constant its the location thats being changed
32537,hmm
32538,by whom to use your vernacular i havent a clue
32539,dont try to be so obtuse what do you imagine im trying to do thats a time distortion as if theres a time machine nearby
32540,or a dalek certainly an alien force of some kind
32541,try and look on the bright side after all isnt coal just fossilised plant life
32542,tracking device registers time distortion hoist off your skirts peri off we go
32543,hmm
32544,talking of birds do you notice anything strange
32545,no birds
32546,theyre not usually this effective
32547,they didnt they attacked the machinery
32548,maybe
32549,lets say im keeping an open mind can you stand
32550,thats an unusual mark how did you come by that
32551,hey steady just trying to help
32552,i dont suppose he will stephenson
32553,george stephenson
32554,i know of him peri how would you like to meet a genius
32555,yes yes of course but i havent changed the course of history indeed im expressly forbidden so to do but george stephenson will
32556,an astute observation peri can you give us a lift
32557,im not sure we did hit a bump just there
32558,why are we stopping here
32559,where would i find george stephenson
32560,yes yes yes
32561,machinery or more specifically george stephenson and he is just about
32562,and i didnt exaggerate without his genius your precious twentieth century would be a much sorrier place weve got to get in there
32563,to see george stephenson where can i find him
32564,a pass my dear fellow i am a vip
32565,meeting
32566,here let me see that get that dog under control will you now what have we got thomas telford michael faraday humphry davy good heavens peri do you recognise these names
32567,an inspiration of geniuses i dont know but i do know that the people appearing at this meeting will transform history
32568,an oversight
32569,i am indeed im also an inventor look
32570,eccentric me preposterous
32571,ill come with you
32572,theres a good boy good good fido now
32573,thats a good boy let the nice doctor through
32574,occasionally just occasionally your smugness infuriates me
32575,will you stop prattling about the dog
32576,oh really oh thats your assessment is it did you see the date at the top of that list in less than two days from now a meeting will take place here of many of the greatest practical talents the human race has ever produced a coincidence
32577,well hanging around an office is not going to provide the answer
32578,i dont think its me
32579,no still functioning
32580,there was silence deep as death
32581,possibly
32582,careful
32583,looking for george stephenson
32584,peri you really do have an extraordinary capacity for seeking out danger
32585,you ought to learn to avoid situations where
32586,peri get out of here
32587,dont argue just go now now now gentlemen gentlemen please im sure we can come to some amicable understanding
32588,almost at the end of my tether
32589,i cant thank you enough but for your very opportune arrival
32590,your guard is quite right of course we shouldnt have deceived him but how else would we have got in here
32591,i am a great admirer
32592,really do i look like a man who would wreck machines
32593,oh id met the big fellow briefly when i tried to help him
32594,and the disruptions only started recently
32595,its been more extreme
32596,peri
32597,its only the men that are affected
32598,when forgive me lord ravensworth it is important when did they go missing
32599,i cant do that
32600,yes but why arent you interested in why they should want to make me a target
32601,youre forgetting we didnt just stumble into this place we were hijacked
32602,i agree
32603,do you wait here
32604,hold on a minute will you
32605,all right thank you
32606,later you said that the son of one of my attackers worked for you
32607,find him for me will you theres a good chap
32608,and your father was perfectly normal this morning
32609,yes i know bear with me the answers probably staring me straight in the face i just cant see it
32610,bath bathhouse
32611,luke can you find me an old coat
32612,reacted yes i know i said the answer was staring me straight in the face didnt i it was literally
32613,those men didnt look as if theyd come straight from the mine did they they were clean
32614,i am about to follow what you would term as a hunch
32615,you stay here where youll be safe
32616,how do i look
32617,well well well the rani
32618,to see not exactly he was burnt to a crisp the last time i saw him
32619,well since were insulting each other i cant say i care much for your taste in clothes doesnt do a thing for you
32620,my face is of no importance brain regeneration is what i need i should have been able to pin this one down to you personality changes probably due to an imbalance in body chemicals yes youre the obvious culprit well you had me fooled if thats any consolation
32621,youd have been discovered eventually you know even without my intervention
32622,oh this isnt your first visit
32623,without being discovered well im impressed youve obviously a brilliant tactician as well as a brilliant chemist
32624,and now the luddite riots
32625,cover yes but for what i think ive got it youre extracting a chemical from the brain the result is the victims become violent aggressive cant rest thats it the chemical that promotes sleep
32626,i take it youre referring to the master look why dont you release me
32627,these are human beings rani living creatures that have done you no harm
32628,josh
32629,dont hurry back
32630,dont come any further touch me and their orders are to kill
32631,you can get that poor fellow out of danger
32632,use some of that famous american initiative push him outside
32633,their orders relate only to me now move peri
32634,for once will you forget the crossexamination and just go
32635,snuff the candle you always did lack style
32636,thank you rani im glad to see you havent sunk to quite the masters depths
32637,dont think i could stand it
32638,a hyperactive peri too ghastly to contemplate
32639,not one of its most tranquil i agree
32640,you could say that
32641,im afraid i do peri
32642,not that the prince of darkness here would see it as perversion
32643,and you intend to use the ranis bag of tricks to achieve this egocentric scheme
32644,very clever optical illusion created on the screen ive tried that but never succeeded
32645,believe me i am the ranis cleverer than any of us shes managed to modify that scanner so it presents whats in the mind instead of whats happening in reality
32646,i cant really see from this far away
32647,i gather theyre going to throw it down the pit
32648,push peri push push no no peri the other way
32649,thank you gentlemen im most grateful if you could just
32650,stay back
32651,no
32652,a trifle cramped
32653,its these straps
32654,the straps oh its a long story
32655,george stephenson i presume
32656,absolutely delighted to meet you sir if youd be so kind as to undo the straps
32657,stephenson weve got to get away
32658,somewhat unorthodox entry
32659,lord ravensworth
32660,except these werent luddites
32661,thats what you were supposed to think
32662,thought i was attending this meeting of yours
32663,afraid so not just me either
32664,you disappoint me a practical man and yet you refuse to believe the evidence of your own eyes
32665,dont you
32666,when its safe
32667,luke be careful your fathers not the man he was
32668,peris right ill talk to you later stephenson come on
32669,you do make a mess of that pretty dress
32670,peripheral vision
32671,the victim returns to the scene of the crime
32672,hmm
32673,they wont be
32674,cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once   targetblank julius caesar act ii scene
32675,hmm interesting fellow the bard must see him again sometime ah ha
32676,no more likely the ranis handiwork no dont come any further the ranis quite capable of leaving some very unpleasant surprises behind
32677,not far the master will ensure that he has something she wants
32678,drain the substance from your brain that enables you to sleep
32679,like many scientists im afraid the rani simply sees us as walking heaps of chemicals theres no place for the soul in her scheme of things
32680,same way as i know the master
32681,exactly two of a kind odd very odd
32682,now i would have said turners too passionate for the ranis sterile taste
32683,ah ha
32684,see if weve misjudged the rani
32685,mustard gas its a killer
32686,dont breath it in whatever you do dont breath it in
32687,the ranis assistant
32688,open it ventilation quickly
32689,hmm embryos of the tyrannosaurus rex she must have popped back to the cretaceous age and picked up a few nasty creatures vicious teeth bite your leg off chew it all up bone and all all in one go wonder what she wants with them
32690,dont argue move
32691,incredible absolutely incredible a tardis linked to a stattenheim remote control the rani is a genius shame i cant stand her i wonder if i was particularly nice to her she might no no no of course not
32692,dilettante
32693,how indeed
32694,did you really believe id abandon you
32695,later wheres stephenson
32696,theres nothing i can do these men need rest
32697,theyve been robbed of the power of sleep
32698,i havent got time to explain now peri stay here see what you can do
32699,you expecting trouble
32700,message
32701,luke brought you the message
32702,stephenson its not safe for you out there let me go
32703,if hes out there ill bring him to you i promise
32704,oh no thanks ive given them up guns can seriously damage your health you know another thing i cant explain but it is important dont trust luke
32705,will you come into my parlour said the spider to the fly i think not doesnt feel right
32706,no
32707,a characteristic you both share underestimating your opponents well i got your message im here what obnoxious fate have you devise
32708,because he blamed you for its failure not this  far too simple no youd have brewed something much more malignant perhaps the answers down there in the dell where i was supposed to go
32709,and youre so warped so callous you think that justifies it first you turn an innocent young man into your acolyte force him to betray his friends and then you do this monstrous thing to him
32710,youll be telling me next hes better off
32711,they should never have exiled you they should have locked you in a padded cell now move before i forget my abhorrence of violence and use this
32712,wrong on both counts there is no impasse and the dilemma rani will be solved by you you laid those evil contraptions in the dell so you can lead peri out refuse and i wont hesitate to use this
32713,i doubt if the rani ever did anything at random
32714,then youre nominated as understudy i should think youd turn into a laburnum tree
32715,the pods are poisonous be patient peri stay absolutely still
32716,keep exactly in her footsteps peri
32717,not to me she isnt youll do well to remember that
32718,you wandered into a minefield of the ranis making
32719,he just saved your life
32720,ill explain later right move you two i want you off this planet before you commit any further atrocities
32721,give me that
32722,maybe not
32723,all right take them to the old mine working straight along that path wait for me there
32724,stop
32725,you must listen you are making a terrible mistake i am not your enemy
32726,turn back turn back youre walking into a trap
32727,stay calm stay calm its only a matter of balance
32728,peri peri
32729,never mind about that are you all right
32730,shush listen typical hes decided to stand and fight why couldnt he just leave all right come on weve got to get those two into the ranis tardis
32731,later
32732,there was a loose one
32733,further in
32734,stay back peri
32735,while i was in the ranis tardis i made an adjustment or two to the navigational system and velocity regulator
32736,not before theyre beyond the milky way for that matter beyond most galaxies ive heard that conditions are very primitive in the outer reaches of the universe hardly the setting for an harmonious relationship
32737,taken care of i managed to
32738,exactly take this to lord ravensworth will you
32739,hmm
32740,ah battered but not bowed thank you
32741,not much
32742,youll find the answer
32743,and when you do your invention will take off like a rocket stephenson
32744,really i thought they were improving
32745,argue mainly
32746,dont do that youll frighten the fish
32747,you know i think it was rassilon who once said there are few ways in which a time lord can be more innocently occupied then in catching fish
32748,where i dont see one
32749,well whats the use of a good quotation if you cant change it
32750,theyre just lazy today any angler will tell you there are times when nothing will tempt them
32751,the last time i fished this particular stretch i landed four magnificent gumblejack in less than ten minutes
32752,the finest fish in this galaxy probably the universe cleaned skinned quickly panfried in their own juices till theyre golden brown ambrosia steeped in nectar peri the flavour is unforgettable i think ive got a bite
32753,thats it yes give him his head
32754,yes my word this fellows putting up a fight stand by with the gaff peri
32755,not so little peri not so little at all by the feel of this it might be a record
32756,yes but did you see the one that got away that magnificent gumblejack that was trying to eat this poor little fellow there
32757,well try our luck at the great lakes of pandatorea
32758,hm oh youve never seen such fish and as for the pandatorean conga its longer than your railway trains
32759,its restful relaxing i think ive been overdoing things i havent felt at all myself lately
32760,exactly this re
32761,regen
32762,of course im not all right what happened
32763,i never faint i remember now i felt a weakness i felt a weakness and then i i was in another place
32764,celery yes and the tensile strength of jelly babies but i i had a clarinet or was it a flute something you blew into
32765,water no dont think so a recorder thats what it was some kind of mind lock
32766,i am making perfect sense i was being put to death
32767,sit down theyre executing me except it wasnt that way it didnt end like that so its not possible
32768,well i exist im here now therefore i cannot have been killed then that is irrefutable logic isnt it
32769,but the there and then subsumes the here and now so if i was killed then i could only exist now as some sort of temporal tautology that also is irrefutable
32770,the most likely explanation of course is that i havent synchronised properly yet some kind of timeslip in the subconscious
32771,are you trying to be funny
32772,actually thats not such a bad idea
32773,dastari the pioneer of genetic engineering be worth a trip anyway dastaris people are doing some fascinating work on rho mesons as the unstable factor in pin galaxies
32774,hmm oh theyre galaxies within the universe of the atom difficult to study they only exist for one attosecond
32775,it means you have to be quick an attosecond is a quintillionth of a second right here we go
32776,getting medical help
32777,plenty of oxygen
32778,mainly decaying food  and corpses
32779,that is the smell of death peri ancient musk heavy in the air fruitsoft flesh peeling from white bones the unholy unburiable smell of armageddon nothing quite so evocative as ones sense of smell is there
32780,i think youll feel a good deal sicker before were finished here
32781,quite recently too otherwise the atmosphere would have cleared
32782,what
32783,i want to find out what happened here look you can go back to the tardis if you like
32784,when i first saw this station i thought of comet strike or some such natural disaster but its been deliberately destroyed now what kind of monster would want to stop the brilliant work that was being done here pure research for its own sake it threatened no one
32785,would you care to repeat that
32786,and what put that idea into your apology for a brain
32787,certainly not
32788,i will not be threatened by a computer and put some lights on
32789,my dear girl i know a computer when i talk to one come on
32790,the usual floor trips electronic sensors death rays jets of nerve gas nothing to worry about
32791,as long as we keep our wits about us
32792,its depressurising this section got to get out of here no power
32793,it will but well die from lack of air before we freeze to death
32794,not many minutes weve got to get out of this passageway
32795,got to build hydraulic pressure
32796,dastaris office
32797,he liked old familiar things around him he worked out the famous theory of parallel matter at that desk and in pen and ink he detested computers
32798,theyre all dead peri forty of the finest scientific minds ever assembled in one place the barbarity of such a deed i find scarcely conceivable
32799,absolute rubbish this institute was a threat to no one its only purpose was to add to the sum total of knowledge
32800,oh dont know not yet programmed to say that presumably
32801,switching to visual must have lost track of us
32802,therell be an electronic eye somewhere do you notice the floor
32803,cork insulation and carpet
32804,its been tracking us by the heat of our feet in here it couldnt detect us
32805,something like that i wonder what itll try next
32806,most unlikely think of it as a game between it and us
32807,yes my word they were doing some fascinating work here this is dastaris day journal
32808,some people called kartz and reimer were having some success it seems with experiments in time control
32809,well i can yes but i didnt realise the third zoners were that close to to the breakthrough
32810,this last entry the time lords are demanding that kartz and reimer suspend their work alleging their experiments are imperiling the continuum no proof was offered to support this charge so i rejected the demand colleagues fear they may forcibly intervene all agreed that we must stand firm and refuse to be intimidated
32811,no its not possible no matter how dangerous the experiments they were doing theyd have found some other way of halting them not this massacre
32812,no its unbelievable that they would commit such an atrocity the use of force is alien to time lord nature
32813,no i wont believe it there must be some other explanation
32814,setting them up setting setting them up you know sometimes young peri you make amazingly shrewd remarks yes it could be a crude attempt to drive a wedge between gallifrey and the third zone governments
32815,i dont know but i intend to find out
32816,hm oh yes i was forgetting that we still have our homicidal computer to deal with
32817,yes having failed to freeze us to death its now trying to bake us it appears to be a machine with a distinctly limited repertoire
32818,we have to do better than that weve got to find our way to the control centre and turn the wretched thing off
32819,zapped well have to find our way down into the infrastructure and work our way across well be cramped down there but safer than going on the walkways
32820,yes yes it is a bit uncomfortable
32821,save us from death by dehydration that computers been forced to turn the power on but it hasnt energized the door locks if only i could ah ha here you are
32822,ah this looks big enough to get down
32823,not until i find out exactly what happened here
32824,we havent got time to bother about dead androgums peri
32825,i know an androgum when i see one come on
32826,i shouldnt advise that ill be right behind you
32827,that was a bit further down than i expected oh
32828,oh therell be service hatches ow
32829,thanks for reminding me this way i think
32830,well apart from possessing an unerring sense of direction all the service ducts lead this way they must lead up to the control centre
32831,you all right
32832,here give me your hand good girl
32833,cant be much further
32834,hm oh fluidic streams interesting application of an old idea think i detect dastaris hand in the design there
32835,oh theyre selfsealing now that fluid
32836,carries a signal in the same way that the signal in an electronic circuit is carried by the flow of electrons the interesting thing about a fluidic device
32837,what
32838,i was imparting a little information when you ask a question you should listen to the answer my girl otherwise you will gain absolutely no benefit from being in my company it is the province of knowledge to speak and the privilege of wisdom to listen
32839,yeah
32840,good because we have about another mile to go come on
32841,what is it
32842,its not possible youre imagining it
32843,hydraulics
32844,well some of these pumping systems are very old theres bound to be the odd wheeze
32845,theres something down here with us peri
32846,we must be under the central control area now
32847,if i didnt i wouldnt be doing it do have a little faith
32848,not at all these type 49 systems are colourcoded defence mechanisms in red power supplies in yellow and so forth all we have to do is disarm that computer then hopefully well get some civil answers out of the thing
32849,hm yes i know i saw it leads up to the central control area blue you know i cant remember what blue stands for oh well
32850,no no no this is a job for an expert they often boobytrap these computers to prevent tampering berburys noose was a favourite
32851,berburys noose very nasty leaves you without a head
32852,do you know i wish i could remember what that blue line serves
32853,in a minute
32854,what is it
32855,oh peri peri what happened whyd you scream
32856,if you hadnt screamed i wouldnt have triggered that stun jet i was expecting thered be one it cant be human they havent reached this part of the galaxy
32857,vorum gas an ordinary person would have been unconscious for hours
32858,no no i closed my respiratory passages as soon as i detected any danger
32859,with difficulty ill explain one day yes it certainly does appear to be humanoid so it finally mustered the courage to attack
32860,understandable
32861,its jamie how did he get here he should be with me
32862,no thats right but if hes here where am i i must have been here peri
32863,its all right jamie
32864,its all right
32865,open that
32866,no its all right
32867,jamie its all right
32868,oh dont be ridiculous i seem to remember i was always very fond of jamie
32869,no his nervous systems temporarily paralysed hell be fine shortly
32870,yes jamie
32871,im afraid hes deranged its often the effect of extreme fear
32872,he seems very sure of that
32873,of course not i exist therefore i am and was
32874,oh yes i remember that mindslip in the tardis
32875,so i did i wonder if it could have been here
32876,neither do i not yet now jamie i want you to look at this pretty little thing here look
32877,and did you see him
32878,the doctor had an argument with dastari what about
32879,what happened then jamie can you remember
32880,the knights what were they like jamie can you tell me
32881,its all right jamie its all right jamie now sleep sleep
32882,lets see if anythings recorded in that computer
32883,oh hell be all right sleeps the best thing for him right now
32884,of course i never for a moment thought that it was the time lords
32885,well only because of that last entry in dastaris log they must have forced him to write that before they killed him
32886,frame
32887,i see set them up i dont know theyre rabidly xenophobic they probably thought the third zoners were getting too powerful and might align themselves with the rutans
32888,no speak what kind of language is that
32889,i must have disconnected one of its linguistic neurons oh well the data bank is still functioning
32890,hmm
32891,oh the sontarans and the rutans are old enemies theyve been fighting each other across the galaxy for so long theyve almost forgotten what started it ah theres the kartz and reimer work
32892,of course you can understand the time lords wanting to monitor their experiments if the holistic fabric of time were ever punctured itd be like putting a pin into a balloon the universe would simply collapse
32893,peri its possible
32894,that i was killed its why i collapsed the weakness that i felt
32895,yes but if i arrived here during a time experiment caught in an embolism and therefore outside the time flow but if i were dead then and here now it means that i was at the very epicentre of the engulfing chaos
32896,it means the collapse of the universe has started and nothing can stop it
32897,for everything to end a very few centuries
32898,she cant comprehend the scale of it all eternal blackness no more sunsets no more gumblejacks never more a butterfly peri
32899,i am too jamie mccrimmon i am another aspect of him just as he is of me
32900,i was him he will be me
32901,peri look at this
32902,life like isnt it or rather death like
32903,i dont think they did jamie im beginning to understand now they left this illusion to make it appear that i was dead
32904,the sontarans they wanted to prevent any investigation into my disappearance which means i must have been held captive somewhere
32905,that was their mistake they left the animator switched on when you looked into that it copied your body print
32906,no i dont jamie and if im not dead in that form it means my theory about the embolism is also wrong well this begins to have all the hallmarks of a conspiracy
32907,thats right jamie a plot to kidnap me and dastari as well and hes about the only biogeneticist in the galaxy capable of isolating the symbiotic nuclei of a time lord
32908,if the sontarans ever get unlimited access to time travel theyll be invincible we must find out where theyre holding me
32909,i made contact with myself before during that mindslip ill try telepathy its about our only chance
32910,hmm oh seconds hours days who knows theres no such thing as time on the astral plane
32911,where i am am where i
32912,peri jamie was i away very long
32913,boing boing
32914,bells my dear bells come on there isnt a moment to lose
32915,cant quite remember something to do with getting my hair cut
32916,boing the largest of the twenty five bells in the cathedral at seville most distinctive
32917,of course now we know the area where theyre holding me now it was in the distance about three miles i should judge have you been to seville peri
32918,how else would i know the santa maria when i hear it oh do try and use your brain my girl small though it is the human brain can be quite effective when used properly
32919,i am not wrong now this station was attacked ten or twelve days ago in hyperdrive a sontaran cruiser would take that long to reach earth it can only just have reached there
32920,i am not crotchety im just well concerned
32921,about myself chiefly i mean him languishing in some dark dungeon at the mercy of the sontarans
32922,there was an echo an after resonance when youve been locked in as many dungeons as i have you wouldnt fail to recognise it well are you ready
32923,transference
32924,your doctor is an antediluvian fogey allowing himself to be captured by the sontarans if anything happens to myself as a result of it i will never forgive himself
32925,has it indeed what manner of disaster mister
32926,did you see this aeroplane
32927,i am interested in everything mister botcherby but mainly at the moment in this crash you heard
32928,were they indeed i think you may well have done me a great service mister botcherby
32929,i think you saw three fugitives whose trail we have been following for a long time perhaps you can lead us to this hacienda
32930,youll be doing a public service mister botcherby
32931,wait here
32932,just for a scout round
32933,ow
32934,you were expecting a brass band
32935,no but the sontarans are here i can sense their presence
32936,anita this do�a arana is she tall and dark
32937,oh it wasnt her then i couldnt see the man she was with he had his back to me so i couldnt tell if he was human or not
32938,that noise you heard was a spacecraft landing that hacienda is now in the possession of what you would term as alien beings
32939,joshing
32940,couldnt have put it better myself
32941,was she now
32942,androgum
32943,of course though her features havent the heaviness of the typical androgums
32944,what a stupid thing to do
32945,and i was right whatever hes done to her mind her nature will stay exactly the same and androgums have as much emotional capacity as as a gumblejack
32946,we have to find a way of getting into that hacienda without being detected
32947,the cellars thats even better peri youll have to cause a distraction while jamie and i try and find out where im being held
32948,do i have to think of everything knock on the door and say youre lost
32949,thats all right neither do they right anita youd better show us this ice house
32950,oh thats not very likely they seem to be keeping well out of the way at the moment come on lead on
32951,no youve done quite enough already bringing us here anita i want you to collect oscar and get off the estate as fast as you can
32952,mind how you go jamie this ladder seems a ow
32953,lets have a good look round here first
32954,one of thems an androgum jamie he could break us both in half with one hand
32955,theyve got it almost exactly right even down to the briode nebuliser look
32956,the kartzreimer version of the tardis
32957,yeah
32958,it will if i use it or any other time lord but not for anyone else
32959,this machine has to be primed by what we call the rassilon imprimatur thats a kind of symbiotic print within the physiology of a time lord once thats been absorbed into the briode nebuliser you have a time machine that anyone can use that of course was what they didnt understand they simply copied the technology without realising that old rassilon had a second trick up his sleeve
32960,a long way from the war arent you stike going badly is it
32961,my moneys still on the rutans
32962,why oh of course you dont really expect me to give the sontarans the power of unlimited time travel do you
32963,satisfied
32964,yes
32965,wait now thats why you sontarans have no allies you cant be trusted
32966,run jamie
32967,ive come a long way for you  doctor 2
32968,upstairs extemporise
32969,peri can you stand
32970,can you stand
32971,come on then lets get out of here
32972,and theyre turning him into an androgum
32973,you heard dastari two operations i thought stike would have acted by now
32974,i mean he has a functioning time machine i would expect him to try and kill both chessene and dastari before he leaves so why isnt my plan working
32975,jamie you dont think someone of stikes build can sneak up behind me without my hearing him do you
32976,thats why i said what i did none of it was strictly true but he believed it because i was talking to you
32977,oh yes it worked for me but it wont work for him because i have the briode nebuliser
32978,action i think
32979,a double doublecross it gets more interesting by the minute
32980,yeah
32981,now where are they going
32982,right now im afraid hes eighty percent androgum by the time the effect reaches me it will be close to a hundred percent
32983,and it will unless we can save him im already beginning to feel changes
32984,look
32985,peri it is me were following
32986,what
32987,of course were the same but different you only have to see how my sartorial taste has improved for instance
32988,when you travel around as much as i do its almost inevitable that youll run into yourself at some point come on
32989,theyre checking the restaurants something i should have thought of come on lets find them before chessene does
32990,no luck
32991,no didnt look the kind of place theyd have gone for somewhere more elaborate
32992,oh theres a cat
32993,well they say theres more than one way to cook a cat here pussy pussy pusspuss here little puss
32994,they can make quite good eating small mammals are quite flavoursome when baked
32995,i knew it would happen im turning into an androgum
32996,yes yes thats right im a time lord
32997,yes yes yes im all right for the moment
32998,theyve covered that way so well go this
32999,las cadenas
33000,dog where
33001,what happened
33002,let me see that
33003,good night sweet prince
33004,can you walk  doctor 2
33005,this way  doctor 2
33006,mmm i think perhaps dastari you ought to sack your chatelaine
33007,do you mean this
33008,because it contains my symbiotic print
33009,stike forced me to prime and use the machine
33010,there you are
33011,peri wont and she hasnt any symbiotic nuclei i can assure you
33012,satisfied
33013,chain us up after ive handed you the secret of time travel on a plate come on chessene wheres your gratitude
33014,pared the interface  doctor 2
33015,i left a thin membrane so it would work once i knew shed want to test it  doctor 2
33016,good girl
33017,thats it
33018,jamie jamie can you hear me
33019,your just desserts       dastari
33020,hes been er mothballed my word thats a mess itll take you a while to put that back together again  doctor 2
33021,jamie keep an eye on the old gentleman will you    doctor 2
33022,mmm
33023,thats the whole point its not in two places at the same time my tardis is at least five minutes walk from here after you
33024,no after you
33025,no from now on its a healthy vegetarian diet for both of us  ltback to the episode listing
33026,i am never ever lost
33027,i was contemplating taking you to the constellation of andromeda
33028,i havent been there recently thats why
33029,oh where would the first lady suggest
33030,ha
33031,you want a holiday why didnt you say so before i know the very place
33032,oh but such a beautiful moonset ideal tonic for the weary time traveller but if that doesnt appeal as ive said there is always andromeda
33033,some of the most magical sights in the entire universe astral starbursts creating a myriad celestial bodies against a timeless royal blue backdrop
33034,it is
33035,does nothing please you
33036,aimless you see our time together as aimless
33037,i should hope not or perhaps youre trying to tell me youve had enough in that case i can easily set the coordinates for earth 1985
33038,that is a kontron tunnel put more colloquially its a time corridor in space
33039,it doesnt matter whose tunnel it is were heading straight for it and theres nothing we can do about it
33040,well thats beside the point colliding with a time corridor something one tries to avoid
33041,you can never tell with a time tunnel ah
33042,ive found out where the corridors going youre in luck its earth its a period you call 1179ad
33043,as i seem to keep saying thats beside the point once inside a time tunnel the tardis may undergo an adverse kontron effect
33044,bad bad doh bad you dont seem to realise the effect that time particles colliding within a multidimensional implosion field can have
33045,well the short answer is pow
33046,hmm
33047,hmm
33048,bad no its disastrous
33049,hows that line
33050,is it still on the screen
33051,if any part of it leaves the screen let me know immediately
33052,belt up
33053,does it matter
33054,weve never had to negotiate a kontron tunnel before
33055,peri its started
33056,it worked were still in one piece
33057,no no she was real enough
33058,didnt get a chance to ask
33059,no both the tardis and the time corridor have now fully stabilised
33060,yes i only hope she wasnt banking on reaching twelfth century earth the tardis is bound to have deflected her path
33061,we can hardly help ourselves
33062,did i shes attempting to materialise
33063,we must be near the source of the time tunnel
33064,so they should be ive been here before
33065,karfel i was here a regeneration or three back
33066,except that time corridor karfel should be centuries from such technology
33067,no   now dont go wandering off until im certain this place is clear
33068,hello im the doctor
33069,indeed you are this is peri my assistant
33070,yes travelling light this time besides so difficult to recruit good staff these days dont you agree maylin about this time corridor in space
33071,so i see
33072,peri is a bit of a botanist
33073,maylin id like to talk to you about
33074,i think perhaps a little repotting and reprogramming is in order dont you maylin
33075,charming fellow
33076,the place has certainly changed theres something missing what is it
33077,bored already
33078,hello
33079,hey wait a minute
33080,i beg your pardon
33081,splendid
33082,oh the maylin is absolutely right you go and have a look around well join you when weve had a little chat
33083,oh never mind what i said in the tardis off you go the maylin and i have important things to discuss dont we maylin
33084,and you seriously expect me to believe this preposterous story that a lady of the inner sanctum just happened to fall into a time vortex with a vitally important key to your power vault
33085,for what
33086,retrieve it you seriously expect me to go through space and time looking for a lost girl and her trinket give me one good reason why i should
33087,the reason i am doing this maylin is not only to ensure peris safety but the safety and wellbeing of all on this planet something furthest from your mind i fancy
33088,1179 ad add a time deflection coefficient of seven hundred and six years that is 1885 ad
33089,hello have you seen a rather surprised young lady
33090,i can assure you im not that long in the tooth and neat blood brings me out in a rash
33091,not just yet if you dont mind
33092,im afraid we left you rather up in the air on our last fleeting encounter
33093,yes why not im the doctor delighted to meet you
33094,i think you have something
33095,im glad you accept my explanation herbert
33096,er some other time perhaps our first priority is to return the amulet
33097,so do the lives of everyone on karfel it must be returned trust me its the only way to help your people and defeat this borad of whom you speak
33098,i leave immediately youll be safer here with herbert as soon as karfel is free again i promise ill return for you
33099,you sound as irritatingly resolute as another young lady i know very well but we must hurry goodbye herbert perhaps ill allow you to exorcise me another time
33100,were not going on some joy ride you know
33101,absolutely not
33102,no
33103,nice enough young fellow but we must hurry have you got the amulet good remind me to return this mirror to herbert sometime come along
33104,promise
33105,yes of course never like to forget a promise
33106,dont worry about the borad ill deal with him make no mistake i show little mercy to time meddlers
33107,what are you doing here
33108,i know
33109,i know i know
33110,do you realise there is an intergalactic law expressly forbidding stowaways
33111,since theres no time to take you back it looks as if were stuck with you
33112,if you so much as breathe when you shouldnt or get in my way ill lock you up until all this is over is that understood
33113,were transcending the time vortex brace yourselves
33114,wheres the borad i demand to see him
33115,no borad no amulet
33116,do you realise with whom youre dealing
33117,wheres peri you promised her safe return
33118,you gave me your word you microcephalic apostate i demand to see the borad immediately
33119,never
33120,youre as warped as your dictator friend
33121,thank you mykros
33122,right get those guards next door and tie them up
33123,they will but we must be ready for them
33124,were safe for now but we must turn this pause to our advantage
33125,not now herbert mykros can you hand me some strong rope or wire
33126,enter the timelash
33127,not as long as id have liked but it will have to do
33128,its our only hope without the kontron crystals weve got no chance of getting out of here alive
33129,thank you herbert but no those crystals require skilful manipulation rough handling could be dangerous right here we go
33130,the vortex attraction forces are taking effect could be tougher than i thought
33131,get back
33132,yes
33133,when weve stopped congratulating each other perhaps we can get on
33134,every last nut and bolt if you please
33135,just a mess at the moment
33136,i am
33137,youll see
33138,of course itll work i hope
33139,whatever they use to break through that door wont be impeded by a small barricade hurry up with that unit mykros
33140,no it was the same beam of light
33141,precisely what its supposed to do
33142,nearly ready ah there we are
33143,quiet pass me that chain
33144,not exactly kontron crystals have a wide application of uses i have turned this one into a ten second time break
33145,not exactly do you know i havent built one of these in ages
33146,well i timeslipped ten seconds into the future as i did so i projected an image of myself
33147,thats right if youd been able to look through this you would so to speak have been able to see both of me at the same time
33148,of course you cant it only works when this is switched on now when i time slip youll be able to see the image i project and the real me ten seconds in the future
33149,not quite
33150,ah thats work for the second crystal when properly set up itll absorb the energy used to break down that door pass it through a ten second time loop and feed it back again as a beam of pure energy now that is something we can use against an attacker
33151,i think were about to find out
33152,argh
33153,i cant set this time loop accurately enough i was hoping to use the energy absorbed by the machine to project our attackers into the past as yes i cant guarantee a change of location as well
33154,an hour or so
33155,what
33156,of course it did get down
33157,thats me
33158,mmm immeasurably for the better it seems strange how you forget what you used to look like
33159,right you must all get out of here
33160,theres not much you can do for him here
33161,thats a chance youve got to take when the borad finds out whats happened here hell flood the place with troops
33162,to find the borad
33163,no herbert you stay here good luck
33164,and what makes you think you wont do the same for me
33165,all right if anything happens to me youre to find peri
33166,if shes still alive she may find a way of getting you home
33167,im not
33168,indeed and this is as far as you go
33169,come any further and your highlight could be a burial in space with you playing the central part
33170,if im not out in ten minutes find peri
33171,now find yourself somewhere to hide dont want you picked up by the guardoliers
33172,my dear tekker still lurking in other peoples shadows how very typical
33173,that smell that bittersweet sickly aroma
33174,yes of course the creatures of the tunnels i remember now from my last visit so your leader is now a morlox
33175,glad to hear it from what i remember the morlox are not overendowed with intelligence
33176,really not been very bright so far
33177,im afraid you could be right
33178,what i dont understand is how the people of karfel have accepted you
33179,howd you do  borad
33180,but hardly the looks to match
33181,megelen
33182,your experiments obviously succeeded was it worth it
33183,i wouldnt dare not when youve got such big teeth what exactly did happen
33184,it must have made a terrible mess of you
33185,and then the m80 caused a spontaneous tissue amalgamation resulting in a combined mutant  borad
33186,so you keep saying i dont agree with you
33187,do shut up and go away there was no glorious transformation you may have power but you darent even show your real face
33188,to become ruler of a barren planet
33189,it appears you have a lackey with a conscience
33190,time acceleration beam i dont know whether to be impressed or disgusted  borad
33191,oh dont tell me youve got a fat female morlox with a slinky walk
33192,explain
33193,oh very scientific i mean you have a really controlled experiment there what happens if the morlox kills peri before amalgamation takes place
33194,this is lunacy what do you hope to gain by creating another miserable mutation like your pathetic self
33195,really we shall see
33196,hello borad i wouldnt fire if i were you if you do it will be a grave mistake
33197,i really wouldnt fire if you do this crystal will absorb the energy and beam it straight back at you
33198,i did warn you
33199,six five four three two one
33200,you tricked yourself
33201,its me the doctor
33202,herbert you must go to peri
33203,in the tunnels the passage youre in should lead straight there
33204,hurry ill try and find the release mechanism
33205,must be here somewhere
33206,the feeling is entirely mutual now come on weve got to get back to the inner sanctum quickly
33207,weve got a war to stop first
33208,whats happening
33209,this is the doctor i say again this is the doctor please connect me with the ambassador
33210,you must respond i am a time lord i am in fact president of the high council of gallifrey destroy me youll have more than a petty war on your hands ah there you are  bandril
33211,too close  bandril
33212,wait here
33213,i told you to wait with the others
33214,it isnt practical
33215,practical advantageous useful productive efficacious effective
33216,try and stop that missile
33217,the only dangerous thing about it is having you on board to distract me oh
33218,you dont know how
33219,peri every second we waste now brings karfel into even greater danger
33220,
33221,then i shall be unreasonable get out why will you never cooperate
33222,peri i shall be gone for but a minute now if you want to fuss over someone may i suggest that herbert would make a much more eager recipient
33223,if i dont go now there wont be anywhere for you to be stuck to the planet will be destroyed now will you go please
33224,at last
33225,hello what are you doing here
33226,i presume you heard what i said to peri
33227,men men
33228,look what im about to do is very dangerous theres nothing particularly masculine about throwing your life away
33229,i lied and as i did it so badly id have assumed even you would have realised
33230,you didnt think at all thats half your problem a characteristic you share with most of the people on your irritating planet
33231,there isnt time
33232,a very great deal should there be another day i will explain to you in great detail which of the many time laws i am not allowed to transgress
33233,i would so would every other time lord from here to gallifrey and i can assure you theyre not all as pleasant and agreeable as i am
33234,to be perfectly frank herbert when i go thoughts of you will be very low on my list of regrets
33235,shut up
33236,listen herbert if you want to do something useful while waiting to enter valhalla could you read off the numbers on that screen you see immediately in front of you
33237,how many screens do you see immediately in front of you
33238,thats the one
33239,good
33240,better
33241,best
33242,i have set up the tardis to act as a deflector shield
33243,thats right should make quite a big bang
33244,i do wish youd stop saying oh i see
33245,oh well shouldnt be for too long
33246,thirty seconds to impact
33247,well if you have any other suggestions id be very interested to hear them
33248,no lifeboats
33249,impact fifteen seconds
33250,no
33251,impact five seconds
33252,thats not a very good idea
33253,besides its not a very nice way to treat a lady
33254,as i thought the borad was so why arent you
33255,ah not like you to pass up the opportunity to boast what is it
33256,oh cloning oh you are a clever clogs and how very astute of you not to risk your own rotten neck speaking of which shouldnt you release your grip on peris by the way peri did you know he wants you for his bride
33257,ill make a deal with you borad show yourself to peri if she doesnt scream the wedding can take place
33258,i dont think youve got the nerve
33259,make up your mind do you want her dead or as your bride if the latter then show yourself to her
33260,of course not be quiet why wont you
33261,as i thought youre afraid
33262,rejection you can alter peris outward appearance but you cant change the brain in her head whatever you do she will always find you repulsive
33263,thats hardly an elegant solution and the way youve been carrying on youre not going to win her over with your charm
33264,you really are afraid
33265,the possibility of perfect companionship shattered because of your grotesque ugly excuse for a body
33266,i dont think so
33267,what no power to do it yourself
33268,yes to the twelfth century  where exactly did we pick you up
33269,ah thought i recognised the landscape hell be harmless enough there at least hell have somewhere to swim for the next thousand years
33270,from time to time right take cover everyone
33271,fill you in
33272,ah ill explain one day its a neat trick
33273,come on herbert say your goodbyes time we got you home
33274,oh i dont think so i rather think hell take my advice and return to 1885 hell tell the world knowing herbert
33275,not for me to say the waves of time wash us all clean
33276,herbert dropped this
33277,i think hell return to earth dont you after all he does have an interesting story to tell herbert herbert  ltback to the episode listing
33278,how do i look
33279,you eat too much
33280,certainly not blue is the official colour of mourning on necros and womens legs to be covered at all times
33281,its polite not to say safer to honour local customs you should know that by now
33282,guy guy you are talking about professor arthur stengos one of the finest agronomists in the galaxy
33283,do you want me to find out
33284,poor old thing ive warned you about feeding animals
33285,the odd voltrox the occasional speelsnape
33286,only each other come on
33287,herbabaculum vitae
33288,thats right its common name is the weed plant
33289,its very similar in food value to the soya bean plant on earth cant understand why it hasnt been cultivated
33290,usually
33291,some small rodent
33292,not on necros at least not rabies
33293,come my friend be at peace with the world concentrate concentrate there we are now what seems to be the problem
33294,why did you attack us
33295,what happened to you
33296,who is this great healer
33297,you had no choice come on
33298,this is ridiculous
33299,there must be a door no door no letter box no letter box no post
33300,resting in suspended animation peri not dead there is a difference
33301,oh well only one thing left
33302,certainly not we go over the top
33303,well how do you think i feel im a nine hundred year old time lord not much dignity in scrambling over a wall like a small boy into an orchard on a scrumping spree
33304,drop you ill be lucky if i can lift you the amount you weigh
33305,oh no
33306,its all right
33307,forget it i rarely use it
33308,just dont go on about it i shall learn to live without it
33309,on necros
33310,so am i
33311,america doesnt have the monopoly on bad taste
33312,to be perfectly honest neither did i arthur stengos wasnt the type to artificially extend his life to hang around in the vain hope that someone might come up with a cure for the organic breakdown of his body isnt him at all
33313,i was simply being cautious or would you rather i had burdened you with what might have been a piece of paranoid speculation on my part
33314,we know that now but when i first heard the news of stengos death i couldnt be certain
33315,no the tardis is bound to attract attention i want to slip in unnoticed
33316,what was it
33317,well what ever it was its gone
33318,i dont believe it i just dont believe it
33319,no no
33320,this is dreadful
33321,this is the garden of fond memories ive somehow managed to arrive after my own death
33322,in the tardis it is this statue is here of me as i am now i shall never again regenerate
33323,no ive arrived in my own future and im dead
33324,look at it this way if i were to take you back to earth after you had died it would be possible for you to see your own gravestone
33325,gag gag do you realise how much a thing like that would cost far too much for someone to play fun and games and i thought i was good for a few more regenerations
33326,i never thought precognisance of my own death would be so disturbing
33327,is he touting for business
33328,he does go on doesnt he
33329,its not mine like the statue and this grotesque its all part of an elaborate theatrical effect come on weve got work to do
33330,to find out who had that statue erected sorry i cant say its been a pleasure meeting you
33331,really
33332,hmm and itll get a good deal creepier when i find out who erected that statue
33333,oh i shall be subtle play it er very loose to use your parlance
33334,actually weve come about a funeral
33335,burial interment inhumation sepulture obsequy
33336,me
33337,precisely
33338,look im finding what youre saying absolutely fascinating but when i said i was interested in my burial
33339,thank you i was in fact referring to something a little more specific
33340,there is a statue of me erected in the garden of fond memories now i want to know who did it
33341,great healer
33342,excuse us one moment
33343,no i want to find out more about this great healer remember the mutant have a nice day
33344,what a nice man friend of yours
33345,absolutely nothing at all i was only showing an interest      dalek 2
33346,what are the daleks up to
33347,what
33348,growing so davros has finally done it daleks that can reproduce anywhere
33349,pity he didnt put it to a better use
33350,visitors
33351,a knight of the grand order of oberon only i would be stupid enough to attack such a person
33352,i am i am
33353,may i ask what youre doing here
33354,i can indeed  peri
33355,right that should be simple enough ill leave you to destroy the incubation room
33356,reception area good luck
33357,ah there you are they went that way
33358,i see youve been busy
33359,prerogative of a time lord wheres peri
33360,i must say im surprised to see you the last time we met your ship blew up i thought with you on board
33361,or it seems a lift by a transporter to this place
33362,oh i liked the statue by the way very good likeness though really you shouldnt have bothered
33363,all very clever and apart from a little graverobbing what else have you been up to
33364,thats not what ive heard
33365,do you never do anything but kill
33366,but never in their worst nightmares did any of them expect to come back as daleks
33367,with you as their emperor but what of the lesser intellects or will they be left to rot
33368,youve turned them into food
33369,but did you bother to tell anyone they might be eating their own relatives
33370,until you take over their planets
33371,are you all right im sorry about the dj
33372,you may be disappointed at the response
33373,no arm in trying
33374,dont be too certain of that youll be lucky to be alive at the end of this
33375,doctor no
33376,and i shall be waiting for you
33377,it might yet we must act fast before davros daleks can be activated
33378,what we need is a grenade
33379,now listen to me
33380,right what we need now is a bomb to destroy the ones in hibernation
33381,tranquil repose has ceased to have any practical function its cryogenic chambers are empty davros has used the contents for synthetic protein
33382,you must i can show you a new life
33383,davros has created a demand for synthetic protein if you cease to fulfil that demand those planets will die now
33384,grows almost anywhere when refined that produces protein
33385,splendid
33386,i could rig
33387,let me see it
33388,go go now
33389,ill join you later is there anything i can do
33390,of course
33391,did davros get away
33392,he didnt he achieved a greater kill than he thought possible he destroyed davros new generation of daleks
33393,where
33394,get out of here find the tardis and then make sure those two get this place sorted out
33395,this place is called tranquil repose i think we should leave the dead in peace dont you
33396,i know somewhere that is truly tranquil peaceful restful a panacea for the cares of mind
33397,fun oh i suppose anywhere will be peaceful after necros all right ill take you to  this would have led into what is now a lost story  the nightmare fair  only available in book form or as a  reconstructed audio drama from  ltback to the episode listing
33398,hang on
33399,oh stop whinging
33400,then you should have listened more carefully
33401,oh sorry
33402,simple scientific curiosity im not so egotistic as to believe all knowledge is at my fingertips
33403,im not here to help and while youre making all those notes do please note that i did not have access to confidential material the fireball that destroyed ravalox is documented in extinct civilisations by warris bossard
33404,now thats part of the reason why were here
33405,well ravalox has the same mass angle of tilt and period of rotation as earth
33406,well i thought that was quite interesting its unusual to find two planets so similar in fact its quite a phenomenon
33407,ravalox also has the distinction of having been destroyed by a solar fireball
33408,according to the records on gallifrey it was devastated by a solar fireball some five centuries ago i think somebody exaggerated dont you
33409,hmm
33410,exactly
33411,i wondered when youd notice
33412,well done
33413,i also knew that as a student of botany youd soon realise the truth without any prompting from me
33414,yeah
33415,apart from me you mean i dont know shall we find out
33416,hmm
33417,of course not we cant we havent found the entrance yet this is the type of place where some early life forms might have survived come along
33418,hmm yeah
33419,yes i often get that feeling of course i usually have in your case its not possible
33420,youre absolutely right we must find out whats going on here
33421,hmm youre partly right this must have been their last desperate attempt to escape the coming fireball
33422,now thats something of a mystery theres strangely little about ravalox in the records of gallifrey obviously they were a fairly advanced species look    you know you can deduce an awful lot about a civilisation from its art
33423,you know i might stay here a couple of years and write a thesis about that    doctor
33424,oh youre young youll soon heal
33425,you know im glad i decided to come here i might stay here for a year or so and write a thesis ancient life on ravalox by doctor
33426,well i suppose there is a billion to one chance there was a place called marble arch on ravalox
33427,well thats another billion to one chance it does begin to seem a little unlikely doesnt it
33428,its in the wrong part of space for it to be your planet besides according to all the record books this is ravalox
33429,well they i cant not yet unless of course perhaps they collected railway stations
33430,but not impossible though not as impossible as the other explanation
33431,well that somehow or other your planet and its entire constellation managed to shift itself a couple of light years across space after which for some reason it became known as ravalox
33432,oh a long time after your period
33433,wiped out if this was london
33434,now dont get emotional
33435,why do i have to sit here watching peri getting upset while two unsavoury adventurers bully a bunch of natives
33436,as a matter of interest where is peri
33437,wheres that
33438,well cant we just have the edited highlights
33439,of course i do youve been travelling with me long enough to know that none of this really matters not to you your world is safe
33440,im sorry but look at it this way planets come and go stars perish matter disperses coalesces reforms into other patterns other worlds nothing can be eternal
33441,oh i cant theres a mystery here questions to which i must have an answer look peri peri
33442,all right shant be long dont go wandering off be careful
33443,i said be careful
33444,perhaps you could direct me to the stationmasters house now please gentlemen       merdeen
33445,old one
33446,i may look old to you whiskerless youth but ill have you know im in the prime of my life im only nine hundred years old now untie me at once
33447,stoning is this the way you welcome visitors
33448,oh the immortal who might that be
33449,oh goody
33450,oh and what books are those
33451,three splendid what are they called
33452,no but each book must have a name balazar its usually written on the front
33453,yes ive read it what are the other books
33454,will you stop calling me old one i am known as the doctor what else do you read
33455,sounds a rum sort of library to me whats your third book
33456,hmm what do you call this place
33457,no i mean your whole world everything
33458,you said youd unchain me balazar
33459,allow me to be the judge of that unchain me at once
33460,oh why
33461,oh yes
33462,im not excited
33463,yes
33464,oh whyd you stop it at the best bit i was rather enjoying that
33465,clever eh that trick with the umbrella
33466,oh i always like to do the unexpected takes people by surprise
33467,thank you my lady
33468,about which you continually boast thats the trouble with pallid little swats like you balazar you cant even organise an efficient stoning
33469,oh
33470,then im grateful to you merdeen
33471,oh well please convey my thanks to him is that water could i have some
33472,no of course not id forgotten how important that stuff was down here
33473,and how long has the immortal lived in his socalled castle
33474,oh five hundred years
33475,hmm and he never goes out and nobody ever comes in
33476,what selection
33477,why
33478,never believe what is said balazar only what you know
33479,ah no need to knock i imagine
33480,lucky old you
33481,will i
33482,on pain of being turned into a pillar of salt i imagine that sort of thing
33483,oh merdeen why dont you just push off and guard some trains eh
33484,er this is my best side
33485,you were expecting me
33486,then i fear you are under a slight misapprehension drathro i only decided to come here yesterday
33487,gallifrey originally though i travel round a lot
33488,in some ways
33489,oh thats all right even immortals make the odd mistake every few millennia
33490,oh well the locals round here seem to think you are
33491,will i why
33492,oh and you are obviously a robot used to getting your own way
33493,ah i knew you two hadnt ended up for lunch
33494,never mind what is this work you want me to do
33495,sheer poppycock
33496,well how can the boatyard make that claim what might or might not have happened is entirely speculative
33497,oh i only have to look at the graveyard to see that maam
33498,hmm give me a chance ive only just started
33499,yeah i can see that but they dont last forever you know
33500,hmm oh yeah and very useful too thats where the money is
33501,well black light is very tricky stuff drathro
33502,its called intuition
33503,well just a minute black light is not my field
33504,yes now
33505,i am charged with interfering yet its blatantly obvious to a blind speelsnape that i am working under duress
33506,oh then i apologise for my outburst as your ladyship is aware i am unfamiliar unlike the valeyard with court procedure
33507,oh im sorry drathro theres not a lot i can do down here
33508,well you can play at being the slave driver all you like but the fault doesnt lie down here there must be a collection aerial out on the surface which is malfunctioning ill ill just pop up and have a look at it
33509,i think you must have fluff in your audio circuit whats all this stuff for anyway
33510,the three sleepers
33511,i see well if this power failures allowed to get any worse well all be dead soon
33512,because there will be an enormous explosion now i cant impress upon you how urgent it is i go up and look at that converters aerial
33513,oh how do you put up with him
33514,but it was raining buckets outside or it was when i arrived
33515,then why dont you let everyone just pop up and help themselves
33516,inflexible little fellow arent you here hold that
33517,whoops
33518,you did the last time we met
33519,then let me pass i have to get out of here
33520,er yes all right
33521,i should be careful if i was you theres a robot following me who isnt in a very friendly mood
33522,er yes er perhaps but theres something ive got to do much more important first come along balazar
33523,i was trying to help surely even a blockhead like you can see that
33524,i agree my lady
33525,hmm oh oh i knew she wouldnt still be here that girl cant obey an order
33526,peri hurry
33527,this way
33528,i dont know i really think this could be the end
33529,fire at the robot
33530,well i hate to break up this happy reunion but i have to find the aerial to drathros black light converter
33531,gone where
33532,what
33533,more likely start a chain reaction drathros black light systems highly unstable blowing it up is about the worst thing you could have done i have to shut the black light system down now
33534,no
33535,so do i maam especially when im on the receiving end
33536,that is a foul slur
33537,im sorry maam but im not given to violence as the valeyard here suggests occasionally i might have to resort to a modicum of force
33538,as a means of self defence
33539,but
33540,ah how do you do i am known as the doctor now there has been a terrible mistake i shouldnt be here at all
33541,well in a manner of speaking
33542,i beg your pardon
33543,ah yes indeed now how can you possibly have known that
33544,well ive come to repair it
33545,oh these are not my friends well with one
33546,its function is to convert ultraviolet rays to black light
33547,well drathro er the immortal depends on black light to function he is a robot
33548,he lies
33549,er i dont wish to appear discourteous but id better get back to drathro
33550,you have no quarrel with us they destroyed your beacon
33551,look youve got to help us get out of here
33552,if i dont get out of here well all burn
33553,hardly more your style id have thought anyway what does bring you here
33554,oh youre a scholarly philanthropist are you
33555,that goes around blowing up black light converters
33556,in the constellation of andromeda
33557,hmm
33558,but it is in the wrong position
33559,what lost expedition
33560,keep calm and stay still its looking for me but i think its confused
33561,how do you do i am known as the doctor
33562,what possible value does the farmyard here think there is in listening to some halfincapacitated robot and a couple of diminutive nitwits who might as well be robots
33563,im sorry maam but the question still stands
33564,but any record relating to persons not in my presence must be sheer conjecture
33565,yes yes yes yes yes maam i know that my whole point is that im not
33566,not part of the scenes being shown by the scrapyard here im sorry valeyard force of habit i apologise
33567,oh but my tardis is an old model are you telling me its been bugged without my knowledge
33568,keep your head down beware the hand keep your head down
33569,eh
33570,yes i remember now get this thing off me
33571,where are katryca and the others
33572,eh why
33573,but this isnt the immortal this is just how long have they been gone
33574,ive got to get after them
33575,theyve got to be stopped the situations worse than you imagine
33576,trouble is his refraction dipoles are worn out nothing for it now but to shut the black light system down
33577,oh it is but if i shut the black light system down i must shut drathro down as well i can hardly see him agreeing to that
33578,then the black light system will implode and destroy everything in these tunnels
33579,peri i cant let people die if theres a chance of saving them
33580,well i er no maam no let the valeyard here continue give him enough rope to hang himself eh
33581,hurry peri there isnt much time
33582,theres no telling weve got to get past queen katryca into the castle and make that demented robot see sense
33583,merdeen missed your train
33584,oh what are you hunting
33585,dont blame yourself merdeen
33586,well perhaps i can convince the immortal of that i must get to his castle
33587,not if he thinks i can still be of use to him come on there isnt much time
33588,ah tumker and handrail now where are you two off to
33589,i know
33590,then i may only have minutes come along
33591,i didnt appear to be hurrying there did i but that deceptively easy gait of mine covers the ground at amazing speed
33592,oh well you can if you like all compliments gratefully accepted
33593,it is not serious its a farce a farrago of trumped up charges
33594,oh the valeyards charges i always thought valeyard meant learned court prosecutor
33595,not in your case sir your points of law are spurious your evidence weak verging on the irrelevant and your reasoning quite unsound in fact your point of view belongs in quite another place perhaps the mantle of valeyard was a mistake i would therefore suggest that you change it for the garment of quite another sort of yard that of the knackers yard for your argument is as tired and warn out as the poor unfortunate creatures that end up there
33596,for telling the truth never
33597,immature
33598,immature i was on ravalox trying to avert a catastrophe the deaths of several hundred innocent people surely not even in the eyes of time lords can that be deemed either immature or a crime
33599,oh this is ridiculous drathros black light system was in a state of terminal decay before i even arrived on that planet
33600,oh after dibber had blown the aerial up ridiculous anyway those two couldnt repair a leaking tap
33601,where is he now
33602,oh youll be culled all right if i dont get inside that castle along with everybody else around here drathro this is the doctor let me in at once do you hear me
33603,oh i forgot he doesnt exactly entertain very much does he right quickly man take me to the nearest one
33604,well this is a charade if that information was known to those two rogues what possible reason can there be from concealing it from this court
33605,yes
33606,i have returned to help you drathro  drathro
33607,well i dont need a computer to tell me that system is defunct i must shut it down
33608,but its the only way
33609,but if its allowed to run wild and lead to
33610,yes then youll cease then drathro and so will everything else around here
33611,but there are several hundred people here as well drathro
33612,you cant see beyond the end of your tin nose can you
33613,listen
33614,you are only a robot the people out there the work units the organics whatever you choose to call them theyre living creatures drathro they have a right to their lives
33615,in your terms i cant whoever programmed you forgot to include moral values
33616,yes if you want to look at it that way
33617,without organics there wouldnt be any robots thered be no one to create them
33618,your trouble is drathro that youve no concept of what life is
33619,understanding is not the same as knowing drathro your work units are the result of millions of years of development life drathro
33620,but you dont if you could understand one tenth of what life was about youd want me to save those people out there
33621,everything in life has its purpose drathro every creature plays its part but the purpose of life is too big to be knowable a million computers couldnt solve that one
33622,oh thats it isnt it hubris
33623,yes hubris false pride a human sin youve controlled your pointless little empire for too long now you cant see anything beyond it
33624,its only a matter of minutes drathro cant i make you see sense
33625,its not just this planet nobody knows where a black light explosion might end theres never been one
33626,some people think it might cause a chain reaction which could roll on until all matter in the galaxy is exhausted is that what you want
33627,others believe an explosion might cause dimensional transference which would threaten the stability of the entire universe
33628,what
33629,thats peri
33630,yeah im all right for the moment though not for long i fear
33631,ive been trying to convince this mobile junk heap here that none of this need happen if hed only let me shut the system down
33632,oh he wont listen to reason he needs black light to function so he sees no reason why the rest of us should survive that is roughly your narrow egotistical little view isnt it drathro
33633,well done
33634,dont be a fool
33635,strange how low cunning succeeds where intelligent reasoning fails
33636,quickly youve got to help me its a three stage cutout weve got to try and shut the machine down
33637,all i can do now is hope to contain it peri press that row of buttons in front of you
33638,all of them merdeen flick up all the switches with red neons on them
33639,oh show him peri
33640,not long oh these levers havent been moved in centuries
33641,get out of here the pair of you
33642,get out merdeen take her
33643,and still the lobster held on youre in a worse mess than i am
33644,you can ask them for yourself
33645,i told you to get out of here
33646,all right
33647,no balazar for you this is the beginning chapter one paragraph one as they say take your people up to the surface where they belong
33648,perhaps
33649,what is
33650,i know its that way yes farewell but there are still one or two questions that have to be answered like who moved this planet two light years off its original course and what was in that box that glitz and dibber were so interested it
33651,i always knew there was an evil streak in you old one indeed
33652,that is an irrelevant observation i think its now my turn to prevent the case for the defence
33653,well thats not fair look i wish it put on record that my involvement in the affairs of that planet resulted in the freedom of drathros underground slaves
33654,and despite the fact that evidence has been withheld my presence there was most specifically requested
33655,well lives were at stake
33656,i deny that without my help an entire civilisation might have been wiped out
33657,that was a risk i had to take
33658,said enough said enough i have a great deal more to say
33659,i wish to demonstrate
33660,well if the rest of his presentation is as riveting as the first little epic wake me when its finished
33661,well for nothing more than your future in the legal profession i only hope your evidence gets a little better
33662,madam i ask that the court protect me from the abuse of the brickyard here
33663,piercingly and irrefutably so madam
33664,i object
33665,sagacity you sycophant since when has that been a form of address used in a gallifreyan court of law
33666,well you would wouldnt you sagacity indeed
33667,what about the box
33668,and the fact that earth was two light years away from its original position
33669,it was relevant enough to be bleeped from the matrix record
33670,mmm hmm fancy a swim
33671,its a pretty colour
33672,no thats its twin planet thoros alpha come along then
33673,oh so much fuss over a little water
33674,are you frightened it might clash with what youre wearing
33675,oh you arent going to come to any harm its quite safe
33676,hmm yes i suppose it is
33677,yet this was manufactured here somewhere
33678,its more advanced than i thought it seems it can liquefy as well as stun
33679,peri a warlord of thordon wouldnt use his dying words to lie to us remember what he said thoros beta send more beams that kill
33680,the thing is how did a bunch of skullcrackers like the warlords come to own such a device
33681,matter of course it matters an advanced culture manipulating the destinies of a less developed civilisation if thats whats going on here its got to be stopped
33682,who else is there  valeyard
33683,sorry
33684,well youll soon discover i made the right decision
33685,i shouldnt think so there must be some sort of mechanical tide control
33686,well er why not come on
33687,oh
33688,the cd phaser discharged accidentally rerun the struggle see for yourselves
33689,i dont know
33690,mmm yeah just a moment this is incredible such sophistication
33691,as i suspected a device for extracting energy from the sea something your planet had the technology to do long before its fossil fuels ran out but they didnt bother this is just an auxiliary console though the main control room must be somewhere else
33692,oh i doubt if that could even tie its own shoelaces it may have operated this console but it certainly didnt build it
33693,yes oh dear
33694,all we did was land here
33695,further along the shore
33696,oh yes yes of course absolutely
33697,we will help in any way we can
33698,im sure he was its a pity he lost his head and decided to attack us
33699,oh absolutely security is very important
33700,yeah
33701,oh of course cant be too careful yes very good absolutely right
33702,yes cant wait to see good old crozier
33703,crozier well er young ish er look shouldnt we attend to the raak first
33704,well i think it just winked at peri
33705,no accounting for alien taste
33706,not necessarily look may i examine him you can trust me i am a doctor
33707,yes just like young crozier nurse could you prepare to apply the er skedaddle test
33708,come round here i think the alternative could be much worse hold that will you right ready to apply the test sister
33709,on the count of three then one two three
33710,bone from some animal i dont recognise snapped off sharp jagged edges
33711,indeed
33712,its a man
33713,yes yes i am now it also explains how the tooth marks come to be on this
33714,looks like a man acts like a wolf lycanthropy
33715,be careful
33716,no one following yet that is
33717,not yet
33718,lets find out
33719,who indeed someones coming
33720,i did well that explains the cd phaser sales to thordon sild sell anything from bows and arrows to planet disintegrators
33721,they live here thoros betas sils home planet didnt you know
33722,didnt i
33723,how could i forget it cost me a fortune in bird seed
33724,come on mustnt lose track of your friend sil
33725,well even a nervous time lord must appear to act with competence at all times
33726,and his own sometimes
33727,well
33728,well she just happened to be the nearest
33729,well there have been many companions but only one me
33730,this is the most ridiculous preposterous travesty of a trial since the socalled witches of enderhive
33731,they werent hanging about
33732,well perhaps theyve had some bad news hmm
33733,oh i second that ive already seen quite enough of sil thank you
33734,minor errors of judgement nothing more
33735,indeed and my conscience is absolutely clear when i say that he will be unable to provide such evidence so can we please get back to discussing why earth was two light years away from its original position and what was in the box that sabalom glitz was so interested in
33736,my lady it is as clear as the warts on an edargs face that the valeyard has lost his nerve he keeps saying that he has the most damning evidence but where is it i suggest to you my lady that this evidence does not exist whereas the fact that earth was two light years away from its original position is incontrovertible
33737,hmm yuk
33738,not necessarily hmm ah ha
33739,a brain impulse there oh i see well we cant have that
33740,ah how nice to see a familiar face again
33741,what can we do for you sil
33742,it attacked us
33743,not just now thanks
33744,i am sufficiently advanced already
33745,yes it did
33746,so far up above myself on the table down below
33747,i would enjoy that
33748,i dont remember that i cant recall anything after the power flooded through my brain
33749,what
33750,no er
33751,as far as i can tell
33752,i do not
33753,weapons
33754,look out behind you
33755,no thanks
33756,the odds were against us why should i risk my life for a savage and a stupid girl
33757,i think so
33758,why should i follow a mad warlord of thordon whats in it for me huh
33759,im no hero
33760,not any more now im just like you sil
33761,never
33762,cant it
33763,what mercy no no theres something wrong of course sil was right it was a ploy to fool the mentors yes clever old me let the matrix show what it will a clever ploy youll see
33764,believe me im telling the truth i wouldnt lie its not in my nature
33765,the raak attacked us first
33766,excuse me i understand a little of your transference unit principle and i have some knowledge of technological malfunction is there a microcircuitry diagram
33767,is there a module unit replacement or are these ganglion separators adaptable
33768,ah good hmm ah ha did you test the endrodyacen
33769,try it should respond to the lexifier now
33770,you girl here i dont like this drink bring me another
33771,what is in this drink
33772,an enemy my lord the girl who ran away earlier she may have been trying to poison us all
33773,the ploy was to remove us both from the heart of the mentors control section i gambled that after id helped them fix the cerebral transference unit they might trust me to question peri alone
33774,escape i should imagine
33775,the mentor sil fears a conspiracy against the lord kiv you are a spy for the alphans
33776,its all right were alone now we can talk
33777,im your friend you know that
33778,im here to help you
33779,by telling me who the alphans are that are leading the unrest and where they can be annihilated
33780,tell me
33781,answer me the tide is on the turn unless you want to add your own despair to the sea of sorrows i suggest that you tell me everything
33782,your guilt your bungling your alphan friends everything you must help the mentors peri you must help me
33783,i see my own interests i place myself first
33784,you are expendable you have no value tomorrow they intend to take the brain of the lord kiv and transplant it into my body he will possess my body to prevent that i must please the mentors peri if that means sacrificing you in my place then that is the way it must be  crozier
33785,i wonder
33786,but it was never like that
33787,i must do what i think is best
33788,ive told you it was a ploy i would never want to harm peri
33789,well i can recall some of it bits of it are beginning to bob back into my mind
33790,no i mean yes but but the emphasis is all wrong
33791,the events took place but not quite as weve seen them
33792,no and i refute any implication that im barmy
33793,nevertheless i would like this trial to continue
33794,if the time lords of gallifrey want my life you dont think id entrust my defence to one of their august number do you
33795,ah i appear to have lost my way i was looking for croziers operating room
33796,yes thought id strop the odd scalpel mop a brow or two
33797,the btu oh bliss thank you
33798,eeg reading in recipient now level
33799,why dont you go for a walk or something sil youre like an anxious parent
33800,twenty one point five six uh huh
33801,dead dont say that
33802,twenty one twenty forty twenty one fifty six now
33803,i think his chest gills moved did the lexifier unit register its input the link was difficult to test
33804,reserve quickly try the endrodiotone now
33805,hes breathing
33806,yes nice to know that you can be relied upon to be your usual treacherous self
33807,you sure arent you worried about tissue rejection
33808,from you sil why not i could do with a laugh
33809,search conv corp who are they
33810,wait planet of tolk twenty fourth century i seem to recall there were a great many wars around the rim worlds at that time there should be a large amount of battle cruiser debris floating round there soon
33811,if they have the equipment
33812,that should be comforting for him i i think id better see how the patients getting on  trial room
33813,my actions cant be what they seem there is an explanation there must be i cant recall it
33814,no what now lets get on ive had enough of wondering why i acted as i did on thoros beta lets get to it lets find out play the matrix and play it loud and clear
33815,it takes time theyre trying their best
33816,a movement
33817,well as long as you stay away from him he should be all right
33818,merely conserving resources o ineffable one until you return to your rightful place as master of us all
33819,that isnt my fault you cant blame me for that i wasnt even there
33820,please madam the death of verne and the other resistance fighters was not my fault
33821,i am not responsible for that
33822,and highly prejudicial you wont convict me by using shock tactics
33823,then tell it
33824,the body you used to transplant kivs brain whose was it
33825,just a body its a bit casual isnt it
33826,i still think it might have been better if youd waited
33827,hey look at this the host cells are trying to influence kivs brain attempting to alter and distort his memory
33828,perhaps the trauma of the donors death lingers and is infecting kivs brain
33829,hmm hmm oh yes yes yes most disappointing unlike sil i would willingly have given up my body
33830,oh peri ah quite unsuitable female silly flibbertigibbet hopeless
33831,well id prefer it if youd use somebody else
33832,well certainly enough not to want to see her experimented upon
33833,where is everyone
33834,may i examine him i have croziers permission
33835,i shall be as quiet as the silence that is in the starry skies only quieter still
33836,you know him
33837,colleague of croziers  a friend
33838,id quite like a word with that captured king
33839,mmm thats him im sure crozier wouldnt mind
33840,thanks for the warning
33841,how do you do
33842,oh now where would a well brought up king learn a word like that hmm open the door would you
33843,i dont think so
33844,thats quite enough of that im here to help you you in
33845,never mind you can tell me later
33846,no actually i am known as the doctor and theres no need to thank me for helping you to escape come along
33847,what
33848,what
33849,i should have thought that was obvious i need your help to defeat the mentors
33850,yes yes well we can deal with all that later at the moment we need each other
33851,dont worry youll see plenty of action
33852,we havent got time for you to go courting
33853,well well find perpugilliam of the brown on the way
33854,well he soon will be if we dont hurry
33855,hold on no well do this my way im not having you causing a bloodbath
33856,you stay here and watch out for guards stay your majesty
33857,it is my intention to shut him up for good
33858,i thought id try one of those brain implant things
33859,oh absolutely i have carte blanche as far as young crozier is concerned
33860,what are you doing
33861,come on now come on
33862,youll be all right the implant hasnt taken
33863,wheres the control centre
33864,right lets go
33865,well think of the chaos if we remove their mind control and youd have a very willing army to fight the mentors
33866,then please hurry
33867,im sorry about the noise he does so enjoy his work
33868,a friend of yours
33869,just as i feared
33870,have you met sil
33871,the last person you want to have
33872,im sorry
33873,yrcanos
33874,its time we found peri
33875,i remember now whatever made you take me out of time when you did i remember it all i was on my way to save peri
33876,i did try to stop it
33877,and so they took it upon themselves to act like secondrate gods
33878,lies theres something else going on here the high council has no right to order peris or anyone elses death
33879,no i was taken out of time for another reason and i have every intention of finding out what it is   ltback to the episode listing
33880,i doubt that there will ever be sufficient time for that my lady
33881,yes yes i am grateful to you madam for according me the same privilege as the valeyard that allowed me access to the matrix my excursion will be into the future
33882,precisely
33883,my submission concerns a crisis which threatens the lives not only of a group of people confined together with no means of escape but would if unresolved threaten every mortal being on the planet earth
33884,mogar a planet on the perseus arm of the milky way      doctor
33885,now i object am i not to be protected from the prosecutors insinuations on what evidence does he conclude that i embroil myself
33886,i fail to see why youre so curious madam surely you must know where my tardis is
33887,and posing unnecessary questions in order to score cheap points is the tactic of a prosecutor who has no case you have been monitoring my tardis you claim its been bugged with a listening device so you tell the court where my tardis is
33888,thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight
33889,carrot juice
33890,mel have you studied my ears lately
33891,no no seriously though is it my imagination or have they started to grow longer
33892,youll worry sooner when i start to bray
33893,quickly mel press the red button get the message on the screen press it press it
33894,did i must be the carrot juice making me colour blind
33895,how i keep up with you is a constant source of amazement to me
33896,yes lets exercise the grey cells for once shall we rather than the muscles
33897,in which case why wasnt it signed
33898,we wont go blundering into a trap either
33899,cant you sense it mel
33900,evil theres evil in this place
33901,so much for your enthusiasm let me do the talking
33902,he did didnt he
33903,will you please stop poking that contraption into my spine
33904,is it yes it is captain tonker travers
33905,oh
33906,commodore that means this is a grade one security craft
33907,but didnt you send the mayday call
33908,melanie known as mel
33909,ah saved your ship though commodore
33910,not by you though commodore so lets make this hail and farewell shall we
33911,were not
33912,far cry from the carefree life of pease pottage eh mel
33913,i cant rid myself of the feeling im being used whoever sent that message knew me
33914,there is
33915,hed have said
33916,intriguing possibility but thats all
33917,that could also be the quickest way into trouble
33918,dont hustle me mel
33919,hmm meanwhile
33920,i wonder if you can help me
33921,id like to see a copy of the passenger list
33922,no no no no dont bother
33923,ah its not important its just a whim im subject to whims so im told
33924,mmm well if i could i could just spot a familiar name
33925,no no all complete strangers im afraid
33926,thank you
33927,did you see him get a name
33928,now before you go rushing off mel do you know what a judas goat is
33929,getting badly mauled in the process i think i shall refuse the role
33930,for a nonprovocative stroll around the deck
33931,youre not supposed to be in here
33932,hmm
33933,well theres no sense in putting two heads into the noose
33934,hmm
33935,yes the question is did they succeed
33936,what is it
33937,yeah this way
33938,i may be able to help you there commodore
33939,if youd rather i left it to mister rudge
33940,the room was a wreck
33941,to be complete the syllogism only requires its grim conclusion
33942,none at all
33943,yes he does mel he has every right it happens to be true
33944,well our contact obviously hes the one whos been pulverised
33945,what else
33946,my dear melanie if you wish to pursue this completely arbitrary course pray hurry along to the hydroponic centre and leave me to my static and solitary peregrinations
33947,but i reviewed that section earlier when i was preparing my defence there have been changes that isnt what happened the girl melanie her information was important i wouldnt have just ignored it completely uncharacteristic and the words misused didnt even sound like mine
33948,arbitrary course
33949,no no look im sorry madam i cant explain but i have a feeling i am being manipulated that the evidence is being distorted
33950,no
33951,no this is total fabrication
33952,no no this is all wrong every instinct of which i am capable would have made me prevent her
33953,when i viewed the matrix earlier that isnt what happened
33954,no madam i am being manipulated but the only way to discover why and by whom is to press on
33955,which heart would you suggest madam unfortunately that doesnt register a double pulse
33956,no more a sort of clown actually would you care to hear my rendering of on with the motley
33957,ah the commodore wants a chat good i shall enjoy that
33958,er time is a comparative concept commodore
33959,completely utterly whats all this about mel
33960,boobytrapped
33961,or perhaps he wasnt dead the weird atmosphere down there could lead to phantasmagoria
33962,well
33963,the perfect alibi commodore
33964,im cogitating
33965,whether his job is to keep unwanted visitors out or
33966,where are who
33967,uh huh
33968,what do you want them for
33969,is she an agronomist huh youd better leave me to cope with this
33970,mmm this is a situation that requires tact and finesse fortunately i am blessed with both
33971,i understand that youre an agronomist
33972,a thremmatologist then youre well qualified to tell me about these
33973,i never had a chance to be
33974,yes just what i was going to
33975,do they
33976,the name of a god
33977,that still doesnt explain
33978,you sent for him
33979,no
33980,then they should
33981,only of knowledge i have visited your planet its very rich in natural resources
33982,is that all you think it was
33983,you are so pathetically intent on incriminating me you havent been watching whats going on
33984,well you may have been selected to prosecute me valeyard but i hope youll never be chosen to defend me
33985,something vital just happened in that scene and the valeyard perversely switched our attention to more trivial matters
33986,triumph theres no cause for celebration one of the occupants of that lounge is about to die
33987,yes and if you had been watching you would know who was the intended victim
33988,youre very quiet mel not quite your style to go into a brown study
33989,im trying to save him
33990,hes not a mogarian
33991,if youll kindly allow me to remove his face plate i fear this poor fellow is beyond help
33992,grenville
33993,his name isnt grenville its hallett
33994,you recognised him
33995,well he would
33996,this gentlemans just given us the answer
33997,hallett had presumably been assigned to investigate something or somebody on this ship then he had the bad fortune to be recognised a chance encounter that put his entire mission in jeopardy
33998,well you may have been a suspect
33999,together with everyone else on this voyage
34000,no tricks mister rudge i knew hallett and admired him but i assure you until i removed that face plate i had no idea he was on board
34001,it does
34002,at the risk of appearing impertinent sagacity i would point out that you the valeyard and everyone here present could have acquired the same knowledge
34003,with respect you will not hear it from me    travers
34004,agreed and i am indebted to the prosecutor for putting his finger on the nub of my defence the reason why i could no longer stay on the sidelines
34005,providing us with a plethora of suspects
34006,i did he was one of a rare breed a maverick even the highly organised society of the thirtieth century has need of his kind hell be missed and he left these seeds for me to find
34007,yes he wanted me here as a catalyst and to divert attention away from his own activities
34008,hallett was an unorthodox man but he was also a subtle man so why did he resort to such blunderbuss tactics why use me as a judas goat
34009,do you know ive always envied you that
34010,your amazing ability for almost total recall
34011,i could have been comparing you to an elephant well figuratively speaking they never forget
34012,if youd rather wait here
34013,a leaf from halletts pocket
34014,ah ha neither did anyone else another one of my tricks
34015,ah thremmatology the professor said she was a thremmatologist
34016,the science of breeding or propagating animals and plants under domestication
34017,well think mel youve got a good brain think
34018,whats a thremmatologist doing in an isolation room wearing a surgical mask
34019,two
34020,quickly the lounge there are passengers trapped on the double man there are lives at stake                ruth
34021,whats going on in there what are you trying to hide will you please stop mauling me
34022,does the commodore know whats being isolated in there
34023,calculated risks are you telling me that sad travesty is a statistical possibility
34024,satiable curtiosity like the elephants child
34025,no need to quote the book i can explain
34026,no thats all right i know the way
34027,hmm
34028,yes i know its that way
34029,no and if the valeyard would exercise the same restraint as i showed during his presentation of his case against me
34030,and could suppress his bloodlust
34031,i apologise
34032,very narrow margin of safety commodore
34033,still risky though quirky phenomena black holes they can gulp with unpredictable turbulence
34034,ive no reason to lie commodore
34035,begin i take it you mean begin overtly to cooperate youve been using me commodore i would never have been allowed to run free if you hadnt condoned it
34036,frankly i think you should notify the authorities about the death of the investigator hallett and insist on being given full details of his mission
34037,sorry they refused
34038,well that cant happen
34039,murderer yes youll let me know as soon as you get a reply
34040,is there anybody there said the traveller perhaps shes in the gym
34041,quickly woman where are they taken
34042,the pulveriser
34043,doh its gone
34044,the tape the proof we need to force laskys hand
34045,just as he tried to remove you
34046,lasky
34047,janet no
34048,what are they and how do they link with these murders
34049,still got that bit of leaf
34050,hydroponic centre there has to be a connection
34051,follow your lead see if janet has got the tape but mel be careful hmm
34052,it wasnt me in there
34053,i didnt smash the equipment
34054,no no it had to be to prevent the commodore getting information from earth but i didnt do it
34055,the murderer
34056,the prosecutor delights in scoring cheap victories my lady i swear to you when i viewed that section earlier i was nowhere near the communications room
34057,yes yes i am
34058,but what else have i got without evidence to prove my innocence im condemned
34059,i didnt even hear the dinner gong      vervoid 2
34060,youre letting arrogance blinker you professor it may not be your intention but you are in danger of joining an extensive roll of dishonour misguided scientists who claim the pursuit of truth as an excuse for immoral experiments
34061,yes but
34062,but hell live
34063,i rather think his intention is the vital question
34064,hes determined to destroy this ship
34065,can the power to the bridge be cut off
34066,id say rather more than turbulence
34067,your colleague is aiming the hyperion three into the eye of the black hole of tartarus
34068,marsh gas
34069,questions later will smoke masks be any good
34070,here let me
34071,no
34072,you hold me responsible for bruchners death
34073,a hijack but you mogarians are a peaceloving race violence is repugnant to you
34074,hold on rudge if we are being hijacked i think we deserve an explanation
34075,now what do you want in the vault
34076,that cant be your motive
34077,rudge this hijack is just a sideshow theres a much greater menace
34078,here let me after all i am a doctor
34079,no no hes just a weak man gone rogue
34080,or murderers    rudge
34081,what are you doing in there dont you know how dangerous it is
34082,no
34083,too risky attack the bridge
34084,you heard now get out of that air duct quickly
34085,i havent been holding out on you commodore theres a audiotape thatll explain everything
34086,because its been stolen i would like carte blanche to search all the cabins
34087,another request i need a phaser
34088,exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures
34089,could they
34090,mel i entered this affair as a judas goat i intend to readopt the role now if professor lasky had the tape where do you think shed hide it
34091,mmm
34092,does that mean youve hidden it somewhere else
34093,murder amongst other things
34094,i have narrowed the suspects down to two you and professor lasky
34095,i already have
34096,im never frivolous about murder
34097,crucial
34098,and youre not going to object if i force it open
34099,yes i rather thought you might have done
34100,a reckless streak im prone to them it wasnt difficult to pinpoint you the first murder could only have been carried out by someone with access to this unit the second needed poison even the abortive attempt on mels life could only have been committed by someone who could go unchallenged into the isolation room and get the anaesthetic
34101,no not the mogarians she was a hostage when they were slaughtered
34102,could be jealousy professional envy id say it was the more commonplace avarice
34103,provided you can get them back to earth
34104,i take it you have someone willing to finance this exploitation
34105,vision youre talking about slave labour
34106,came to a pretty unpleasant end though
34107,i took the precaution of disarming it
34108,the vervoids are not psychopaths
34109,why is it none of you can see whats so glaringly obvious
34110,no divine insight just logic
34111,when you overheard the vervoids mel how did they describe us
34112,not human beings not mogarians animalkind
34113,at some stage directly or indirectly all animalkind consumes plant life without it wed perish
34114,a conflict in which there can be no justice
34115,and there you have it the direct request i did not meddle i was presented with an appeal and not just from anybody but from the man in whom authority was vested
34116,providing we can trust the matrix my lady and i wont know that until i see it
34117,why cant i rid myself of the feeling were approaching this the wrong way round professor do vervoid chloroplasts function normally
34118,dont prevaricate professor
34119,is there another exit
34120,they wont listen
34121,theyll spare no one
34122,not to a vervoid
34123,its a matter of perspective mel in your house in pease pottage you had a large garden what did you do with the plants and weeds you uprooted
34124,theyre obeying instinct like migrating birds or salmon swimming relentlessly upstream to spawn even though they may die a compulsive following of the life cycle come on mel
34125,we need your help commodore
34126,like the vervoids were being driven by blind instinct kill or be killed
34127,what if instead of bringing their lives to an abrupt end we did the opposite accelerated the vervoid life cycle
34128,vionesium
34129,a rare metal found on the airless planet of mogar
34130,or a hijack
34131,its a substance similar to magnesium exposed to oxygenated air it releases incredibly intense light and carbon dioxide spring summer autumn all condensed into a few moments
34132,youve no alternative commodore
34133,first you must drive the vervoids back to their lair
34134,plunge the ship into darkness
34135,the vionesium mel
34136,she means that too memory like an elephant
34137,but so ludicrously appropriate i find it amusing
34138,no my lady had even a leaf survived and fallen on fertile soil a vervoid would have grown
34139,yes
34140,no my lady that cannot apply had a single vervoid reached earth the human race would have been eliminated
34141,no my lady but i would point out that much of the railyards socalled evidence was a farrago of distortion which would have had ananias baron munchhausen and every other famous liar blushing down to their very toe nails much of the evidence was not as i remembered
34142,yes madam i do all i do not yet understand is who did it and why
34143,and by whom may the key be used
34144,but keys can be copied youll agree
34145,except when its in the hands of those qualified people
34146,the matrix can be physically penetrated the keeper has admitted as much now much of the evidence you saw was totally at variance with my own memory therefore it has been deliberately distorted
34147,somebody who wants my head such as the valeyard
34148,well of course i cant you know i cant
34149,any witnesses i might produce are scattered all over the universe and all through time how can i find them now
34150,melanie glitz what are you doing here
34151,oh no now i really am finished
34152,just one of my oldest enemies
34153,justice pay no attention madam he has no concept of what justice is hed see me dead tomorrow  master
34154,yes madam
34155,glitz
34156,glitz
34157,you were sent here by the master
34158,this court is not interested in your sordid business deals glitz
34159,when we last met you expressed interest in a box
34160,what was in that box
34161,but they were operating from earth
34162,i dont think so stackyard it all begins to make very good sense
34163,doc carry on glitz what happened next
34164,magnotron
34165,well that can only be done by an order in high council  master
34166,in all my travellings throughout the universe i have battled against evil against powermad conspirators i should have stayed here the oldest civilisation decadent degenerate and rotten to the core ha powermad conspirators daleks sontarans cybermen theyre still in the nursery compared to us ten million years of absolute power thats what it takes to be really corrupt
34167,unseemly outbursts if i hadnt visited ravalox as i then thought of it the high council would have kept this outrage carefully buried as presumably they have for several centuries  master
34168,just a minute did you call him the doctor  master
34169,what
34170,glitz come on
34171,there must be another way out of here
34172,what
34173,well quickly man open it he must be brought back
34174,i must perhaps nothing in my life has ever been so important come on glitz
34175,oh oh what an unpleasant journey what an unpleasant place    valeyard
34176,hurry man
34177,oh i dont know i dont know whether what just happened to me was real or an illusion
34178,do you mind
34179,water
34180,were not in the real world any longer sabalom glitz whatever attacked me was in that barrel
34181,or was it in my mind
34182,into the matrix where the only logic is that there isnt any logic
34183,its from the master
34184,it tells me where the valeyard has his base
34185,so thats where he got to
34186,no come on i want you to meet my darker side
34187,pop in and say hello youll be perfectly safe
34188,not when youre wearing a mark seven postidion life preserver
34189,yes hes playing games he wants to humiliate me first
34190,your presence here makes his task more difficult he knows that he also knows that together we can fight him
34191,if you leave and i die what future do you think youll have as the only witness to events here the valeyard will be forced to seek you out and kill you
34192,good man now button your life preserver and lets get on with it
34193,how do you do i think were expected
34194,wed like to see the proprietor please
34195,i think youll find were expected
34196,i am known as the doctor and this is mister sabalom glitz
34197,ive told you its called humiliation could you hurry up please we havent got all day
34198,oh i dont know ive always been a bit of an iconoclast by nature
34199,well at least youre expecting us
34200,i think its called bureaucracy
34201,but were already expected
34202,is there no way to expedite the procedure
34203,because your employer wants me dead
34204,what is it
34205,obviously the valeyard doesnt trust the high council to honour their side of the bargain
34206,were in the valeyards domain he can try and kill me any time he likes ill sign my remaining lives away to mister j j chambers
34207,absolutely now can we see your proprietor
34208,not if it precipitates my meeting with the valeyard
34209,bad joke but everything round here is a bad joke
34210,oh do concentrate glitz how often must i tell you were not dealing with reality
34211,death
34212,puzzles the will  hamlet act three scene one
34213,quite so but what i dont comprehend
34214,what i dont comprehend is why you want me dead no no let me rephrase that it would satisfy my curiosity to know why you should go to such extraordinary lengths to kill me
34215,to trace the valeyard
34216,illusion glitz the shadow not the substance but if you dont want to come you can stay here and build sandcastles im sure if you think hard enough you can conjure up a bucket and spade
34217,back pedal
34218,alas no
34219,asphyxiating nerve gas this is in deadly earnest
34220,run
34221,well i never thought id welcome the sight of you
34222,what puzzles me is why its happening now
34223,ho
34224,mel
34225,yes yes of course its me where are you
34226,what are you doing in the matrix
34227,where are we going
34228,but thats the seventh door youre taking me back to the trial room
34229,quite the pragmatist arent you youre quite right of course lets get it over with
34230,i would trust mel with my life
34231,just tell the truth
34232,the truth cant harm me
34233,theres always a choice
34234,unless we are prepared to sacrifice our lives for the good of all then evil and anarchy will spread like the plague the rule of law must prevail madam i accept your verdict
34235,it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known
34236,go away mel go away
34237,ow youve ruined everything
34238,all youve done is keep me from a confrontation with the valeyard
34239,to a death chamber as a result of a bogus trial and my noble act of selfsacrifice
34240,because of you mel in your evidence you testified youd heard me deny the charge of genocide but you werent even there you hadnt been inside the courtroom at that time and with your extraordinary ability of total recall you wouldnt have made such an elementary mistake
34241,the valeyard overestimates his own cleverness like all megalomaniacs he is consumed with his own vanity there that should inflame his bloated ego come on
34242,to find mister j j chambers
34243,oh oh you do
34244,and how do we do that
34245,assuming that its me hes after
34246,yes yes they were elaborate werent they perhaps too elaborate
34247,dont go through that
34248,look at this mel
34249,of time lords attending my trial every member of the ultimate court of appeal the supreme guardians of gallifreyan law
34250,do you notice something else
34251,the handwriting
34252,will you lead the way mister popplewick
34253,ah just a minute you wont be needing this mister popplewick
34254,i already have over nine hundred years
34255,secret mel what secret
34256,such craftsmanship pride in every cog and piston
34257,yeah how could i forget
34258,i dont know decided to stay outside on guard perhaps eh mister popplewick
34259,yes yes you do that mister popplewick
34260,yes well i rather thought you might have some trouble whos that
34261,well lets ask him shall we
34262,the performance was too grotesque to be real i have never been able to resist a touch of the grand guignol have we
34263,really why
34264,a maser
34265,an acronym for microwave amplification and stimulated emission of radiation
34266,disseminate a particle disseminator
34267,ive just realised my writing our writing a hit list
34268,the matrix screen mel get back to the trial room tell them to disconnect the matrix screen and evacuate the court
34269,go do it or therell be mass murder
34270,if you could compile this monstrosity it follows that i should be able to unravel it
34271,eureka and you said it couldnt be immobilised
34272,induced an antiphase signal into the telemetry unit the whole system should selfdestruct
34273,no
34274,ah now let me see where were we i was about to be sentenced i believe
34275,ah verumnic
34276,ah ah ha ive a better idea
34277,indeed i am and were there such a thing as an intergalactic postal vote youd have mine
34278,oh you could do me one small favour if you would
34279,when the matrix is restored you can do what you like with the master but exercise leniency with sabalom glitz hes not beyond redemption
34280,carrot juice
34281,you know i think i was rash in turning down that offer of the presidency
34282,oh carrot juice    doctor
34283,no no mel
34284,why should you care since you were exiled from gallifrey youve had nothing but contempt for all other time lords
34285,and what do you want with me and wheres mel
34286,youre up to something perhaps ill find the answer on this
34287,youre trying to deflect me so the answer is on here quarks one up one down one strange matter that asteroid is composed of strange matter what monstrous experiment are you dabbling in now
34288,ethics dont be such a hypocrite your past is littered with the mutilated results of your unethical experiments
34289,stay away whatever youve brought me here for im having no part of it
34290,stay away or ill smash this
34291,ill smash it to pieces
34292,where am i who are you
34293,all right am i of course and you
34294,why not indeed we both are
34295,of course fit as a trombone
34296,hmm
34297,are you nerves i expect now lets see what were we up to er mel did you say your name was
34298,red hair i recall red hair
34299,no standing next to you
34300,me no wonder ive lost my memory
34301,experiment
34302,the explosion must have caused me to regenerate
34303,i want all mirrors removed from the tardis henceforth
34304,oh yes the tardis and you mel theres something not quite in sync i must be suffering from postregeneration amnesia
34305,important did i i wonder what i was up to
34306,oh yes i definitely remember that
34307,how did you know that mel
34308,university you remind me of someone i used to know when i was there
34309,your confidence in me is very flattering mel
34310,come on come on
34311,why i chose you as an assistant ill never know perhaps i will when ive regained my memory
34312,well look at me cant you see mop my brow
34313,a bad workman always blames his fools
34314,do i detect a hint of bad temper mel why are you behaving so uppity could it be that you think yourself superior to me
34315,quite though at the moment i feel far from superior this is all a mystery to me
34316,oh yes yes must you state the obvious i know that its functions diffuse the impulses from there with this goo but whats it for im beginning to think this setups got nothing to do with me
34317,omnipotence the mind behind this bag of tricks operates on a grand scale
34318,whats in there
34319,are you as clueless as you appear mel
34320,wouldnt i
34321,thats it then im doing nothing until my memory returns nothing until i know what im about
34322,no i will not work in the dark like this
34323,im adamant this could be some diabolical scheme
34324,thats the question
34325,hmm what is it
34326,oh you drink it i dont want it dont try to humour me leave me alone
34327,how do you know what im like ive regenerated i mean look at me look at me
34328,perhaps this is my new persona sulky badtempered i mean think how i spoke to you earlier
34329,even so thats probably how i am now you dont understand regeneration mel its a lottery and ive drawn the short plank anyway i need a radiation wave meter and brilliant as i am even i cant improvise that
34330,the tardis do you know where it is
34331,oh good i fancy a breath of fresh air well both go
34332,are you coming mel
34333,rather unusual species cant say i recognise it humanoid with reptilian influences wouldnt you say mel
34334,really i suppose weve explored this planet i wish i could remember
34335,rather a harsh judgment mel
34336,the more i know me the less i like me
34337,no i think not lacks my natural humility
34338,old hat
34339,ah thank goodness in this regeneration ive regained my impeccable sense of haute couture
34340,i was hallucinating i had an overwhelming sense of evil and there was a word ra ra ran rad
34341,oh yes where do you reckon id keep it
34342,wont be a jiffy absence makes the nose grow longer
34343,rani thats the name the evil name
34344,er well yes it must be yes
34345,completely
34346,destroyed lets not be hasty
34347,you know i cant help feeling sorry for the rani mel getting caught in her own devious trap
34348,i suppose so but what was she doing prowling around on lakertya
34349,is it
34350,have to be a cosmic breakthrough for a neurochemist of her stature to come storming the barricades
34351,what scientific knowledge what am i doing if only i could remember
34352,the machine wont tell me whats behind that locked door will it the machine wont restore my memory will it if the rani was after our experiment we must be playing with fire
34353,is she oh dont underestimate her shes a brilliant but sterile mind theres not one spark of decency in her
34354,you are
34355,its my forte
34356,and another thing why was the rani dressed like you mel
34357,no she was in disguise practising another one of her talents
34358,afraid so more hasta less vista
34359,i cannot understand how i could have made such a fundamental mistake
34360,the heat radiation from the catalyst was of high frequency
34361,so elementary i broke the second law of thermodynamics
34362,you should know the answer to that mel didnt c p snow expound on thermodynamics
34363,well you said you admired all his writings read all his books
34364,you mel forget a kangaroo never forgets
34365,oh yes memory like an elephant a running gag applied to you i feel sure mel
34366,oh here see for yourself
34367,what
34368,did you mel theres something caged in there
34369,eh
34370,oh yes phb its biodegradable we dont want to litter up lakertya with nondestructible waste like theyre doing on your planet mel
34371,sugar and starch we can ferment our own
34372,pes no not so good its a petroleum based plastic
34373,mmm
34374,where
34375,but i thought you said the lakertyans werent very advanced
34376,yes
34377,you wheres mel
34378,what have you done with her
34379,hes here
34380,its me you washer woman me
34381,drop the melodramatics your pathetic impersonation doesnt fool me at all incidentally that wigs not you
34382,i knew you werent finished rani i told mel as much
34383,no mel
34384,try looking in the mirror at the face of evil
34385,all right compromise let me feel your pulse
34386,ah the proof of the pumpkins in the squeezing
34387,let me feel your pulse pulses i should say two of them one for each heart
34388,yes perhaps i am because if youre the rani im dicing with destruction
34389,mel the worst shell do is give me carrot juice carrot juice what made me think of that
34390,favourite i hate it
34391,ah caught you out havent i
34392,ive regenerated and im suffering from postregenerative amnesia as far as i can remember fair exchange is no mockery you feel my pulses ill feel yours ill lean across here with my arm behind my back if you want proof im a time lord come on
34393,thats what ive been trying to tell you now yours
34394,mel
34395,yes and ive become more of a fool too it seems mel doesnt bode well for my seventh persona being so completely taken in by the wretched rani
34396,but what does she want with me
34397,strange matter
34398,you should have mel a princeton physicist discovered it in your earth year 1984
34399,its an incredibly dense form of matter a lump the size of this would weigh more than your planet earth
34400,an astute question if that asteroid exploded it would send off a blast of gamma rays equivalent to a supernova
34401,and everything else in this corner of the galaxy when the rani dabbles she dabbles on a grand scale
34402,yes but why mel why what is she up to it starts here
34403,and leave the lakertyans to the machinations    doctor
34404,did you hear a voice or am i hallucinating  beyus
34405,whod have thought shed have been so obvious huh thats my age and the ranis
34406,geniuses every one of them the ranis collected together the most creative minds and the most powerful matter in the universe
34407,the scope of her imagination is breathtaking
34408,not admiration fascination and sadness if only the rani could have redirected her incredible talents for good
34409,what is it i can contribute these other geniuses cant
34410,with a unique conceptual understanding of the properties of time
34411,pity beyus why have you assisted
34412,take mel
34413,go mel go
34414,on is it oh yes i was trying to jog my memory no luck though hold the other end mel
34415,yes well where theres a will theres a tom dick and a harriet
34416,oh no no no theres some information i simply must have before i make the final delicate adjustments
34417,ideally whats behind that door
34418,the identity of this rather interesting substance
34419,crucial
34420,no stop
34421,i say i mean we may not see eye to eye try and see it my way im trying not to be personal i mean after all a bat may look at a time lord
34422,i cant say i share the ranis taste in pets
34423,this is what ill never forget unique talents every one of them the ranis roamed the universe plucking these geniuses out of time at the height of their powers and reducing them to the status of laboratory specimens
34424,time the concept of time im sure thats at the heart of what shes up to otherwise why reserve a place for me a time lord in this abysmal parade
34425,which you will help her put me in
34426,you know beyus your collaboration with the ranis difficult to understand
34427,nothing outside compared to this
34428,its composed of strange matter beyus a devastating force with the right trigger that harmless asteroid as you call it could incinerate your planet and anything else in this corner of the galaxy and what does the rani keep behind there oh all good things come to a bend
34429,i had no intention of hurting you  rani
34430,heres a turn up for the cook a rock that talks
34431,dont hold that against me
34432,that bad
34433,hello havent i seen you hanging around somewhere
34434,no restrictions for movement the lakertyans can come and go freely then
34435,not a favourite haunt of yours i take it ikona
34436,he said id find the answer to his subservience here
34437,why not
34438,he was too anxious for explanations but whatever the threat it must be considerable do you see anything thats different new
34439,hmm i wonder couldnt we ask someone you know if
34440,theres none so deaf as those that clutch at straws
34441,hmm killer insects
34442,let mel come towards me ive kept my side of the bargain youve got what you want
34443,whats he crowing on about mel
34444,oh the rani would never go to those extremes she never does anything without reason
34445,a bird in the hand keeps the doctor away
34446,only on this occasion itll have the opposite affect
34447,hmm a space rocket launcher sure enough but have you noticed its got a fixed trajectory
34448,maybe as a side effect ikona but not the intention id say the target is the asteroid of strange matter which means the launch is locked into a precise time
34449,assuming it is the ranis overriding priority will be to meet that countdown no more setbacks or delays i must go back to the laboratory that sealed chamber ive got to get in there out of the frying pan into the mire right ikona start the diversionary tactics
34450,quick mel dont just stand there help me
34451,no mel two wrongs dont make a left turn right
34452,leave the quotes to the expert mel
34453,so the target is the asteroid which at any moment now will reach the solstice and im sure thats the deadline he who dares spins
34454,do you realise how close the rani must have taken her tardis in order to record that
34455,not by my reckoning the only known detonator for exploding a strange matter asteroid is strange matter itself
34456,a lump the size of this brain would weigh as much as an entire planet
34457,for a lightweight substitute could be could be
34458,not completely what i cant fathom is why the rani took such an incredible risk to record a supernova
34459,no more than that she wouldnt be simply interested in a display of pyrotechnics too negative no theres a deeper motive and the answers in here
34460,a knowledge of time oh a great discovery i worked that out ages ago
34461,not the complete story the last chapters missing keeping quiet isnt it
34462,possibly on the other hand it could be wondering why you want helium two thats why you want to explode strange matter isnt it to reproduce helium two
34463,indeed you dont  discrete particles of time
34464,a time manipulator youre going to change this planet into a time manipulator
34465,i dont believe it a time manip this monstrosity will give you the ability to change the order of creation
34466,that means shakespeare michelangelo louis pasteur elvis even mrs malaprop will never have existed     rani
34467,before i thought you were a psychopath without murderous intent i withdraw the qualification
34468,stay back
34469,waste net want net
34470,and so you shall you have a big part to play ikona you must stir up the lakertyans into fighting back come quickly
34471,hmm
34472,less of the pessimism mel not all the cards are in the ranis flavour
34473,beneficiary good thinking ikona
34474,shes not the only one with a sting in her tail
34475,sting a double bluff a speciality of mine
34476,when that voice reaches zero therell be nobody left on lakertya to listen to me or anyone else
34477,first see if theres anyone in there mel all hands to the stumps
34478,ikona take good care of him
34479,they all are louis pasteur he will rid his world of a major scourge he will save the lives of tens of millions
34480,whoops oh take them back to the tardis
34481,thank you ikona
34482,dont leave it too late beyus
34483,rani its over youre beaten ive aborted the launch and the lakertyans are preparing to attack
34484,the delay in lift off means the rocket will miss the asteroid
34485,absolutely a miss is as good as a smile
34486,whats that
34487,an antidote against those killer insects in the globe the rani always takes out an insurance policy
34488,well time and tide melts the snowman
34489,whos waiting im ready
34490,ill grow on you mel ill grow on you  ltback to the episode listing
34491,thats the problem with young people today no spirit of adventure       fire escape
34492,well if you want to stay here watching a guide book when you could actually be enjoying the real thing thats up to you
34493,paradise towers any second now
34494,you may want to lie by the pool doing nothing all day i intend to explore paradise towers is supposed to be a remarkable architectural achievement im told won all sorts of awards way back in the er twenty first century are you ready
34495,well here we are
34496,nothings just rubbish if you have an enquiring mind
34497,well you never can tell
34498,why did i have to jettison the pool from the tardis
34499,there is a rather spectacular swimming pool on the planet griophos i understand
34500,just one snag
34501,its for the exclusive use of the gulmaris
34502,a rather nasty breed of flesh eating octopi personally id rather stay here and explore i wonder what happened
34503,thats the spirit mel this could be fascinating are you coming
34504,oh very well but weve only just arrived theres no need to start worrying yet         34512
34505,the red kangs i gather there are other colour kangs
34506,why is that
34507,not got very enquiring minds have you
34508,who are of course the best they seem to be some sort of gang all girls by the looks of it perhaps theyll ask you to join up mel
34509,pardon
34510,ah now were getting somewhere im the doctor
34511,how do you do
34512,say hello hello hello
34513,you dont have to do that what about mel then
34514,oh thank you very much but clothes dont maketh the man you know
34515,red kangs are best yes well now that weve been introduced i think that some explanations are in order were visitors to paradise towers only just arrived so you cant really expect mel to understand what youre talking about
34516,pardon
34517,you mean visitors arent allowed
34518,theres always a first time i mean not everyone youre going to meets going to be a kang
34519,and
34520,i see and who are these er caretakers
34521,i see and all the young ones are kangs
34522,or girls i should say there dont seem to be any boys
34523,i see well i must say its been nice meeting you but i think its time we ought to be on our waygt dont you think so mel
34524,did you oh i expect your ears were playing tricks on you
34525,i wonder if blue kangs behave like this     34512
34526,they liked my clothes which is clearly not enough
34527,excuse me
34528,did you say a whole tribe of yellow kangs have been wiped out i mean made unalive just like that but why you didnt kill them did you
34529,who did it then the caretakers the blue kangs i mean who
34530,that doesnt matter are you the caretakers
34531,and you take care of people that is
34532,you seem to be our best bet so far dont you think so mel mel wheres mel
34533,and that means
34534,oh very generous of you it must be a job trying to keep these corridors clean and tidy like this
34535,oh thats what you call them wallscrawlers
34536,by my two tickers whats that
34537,it looks like a kang and something attacking her some sort of claw oh here theres a drill and down here theres a nozzle sucking things up
34538,lets hope theyre just silly pictures whats that
34539,oh i see its some sort of robotic cleaner with automotive bicurval scraping blades impressive workmanship
34540,no i dont but i intend to now lets have a look at this automotive blades shall we ah yes
34541,run
34542,but i thought you said the lifts here dont work
34543,greetings
34544,and i am
34545,well im not the great architect im the doctor
34546,you cant condemn me without trial without evidence without proof i mean i dont even know who this great architect is
34547,anything the matter
34548,shall i tell you what puzzles me most those cleaners we had so much trouble with well presumably theyre part of the organisation of paradise towers like your caretakers so why should they attack you
34549,never
34550,i suppose how you guard me is in that rulebook
34551,i wouldnt mind having a look at that rulebook if thats not against the rules i mean after all i am a condemned man
34552,how extraordinary no no it cant be true
34553,oh no no its you couldnt possibly
34554,if you say so i dont want to make a fool of you
34555,oh very well but i find it hard to credit
34556,it says here about a three two seven appendix three subsection nine death that after youve been guarding the condemned prisoner for  thirty five minutes you must all stand up
34557,yes i know i know i find it extraordinary i dont really expect you to do it but it is in there
34558,for about a minute and a half you see thats how long the prisoner needs
34559,find the key card to the door and escape
34560,find the key card to the door and escape
34561,mel mel
34562,nothing ventured
34563,oh whats happening i dont understand
34564,oh build high for happiness what happened
34565,i only wish i knew fire escape bin liner i never expected to see you again still less i didnt expect to be glad to see you again but ive got to go theres much to be done
34566,it was an accident i was being chased by two cleaners and then suddenly
34567,yes i expect theyve gone by now
34568,do i get the impression im not believed
34569,oh do they now why dont you tell me about it
34570,i know ive seen them and the caretakers theyre no better they allow themselves to get killed off without saying anything either just because theres nothing about it in their precious rulebook
34571,i know because ive read it
34572,oh dont tell me you dont know i mean what is going on i mean what is behind that door belching out smoke that you kangs are so keen on painting pictures of eh any ideas or is that simply just another mystery
34573,thank goodness for that can i have a look
34574,im sure
34575,build high for happiness but let us not forget what we have to do we must find mel and discover the mystery of paradise towers because ive learned enough to realise that its very existence is at stake
34576,not at all you dont understand i mean the last people i want to meet are the caretakers im in as much danger as you more probably you got to believe me listen weve got to work together the chief caretakers off his head if we dont stop the wipeouts who will please
34577,you must have a secret escape route i mean its not like kangs to allow themselves to be caught like rats in a trap
34578,but what
34579,i see you need time well i will buy you that time im the reason why the caretakers are here now go on make your escape go on shoo build high for happiness
34580,greetings deputy chief caretaker you look surprised to see me i cant imagine why after all it was me you came for
34581,as a matter of fact i am
34582,take a look for yourself if you dont believe me
34583,you mean youre not certain anymore
34584,what makes you think im the great architect havent you ever met him
34585,how odd
34586,and that would justify killing me i mean him
34587,like everyone else you seem terrified to face up to the reality of whats happening in paradise towers i mean killing me wont help you find out whos sending out those robotic cleaners to kill people and thats a problem that isnt going to go away unless of course youre giving the orders yourself
34588,perhaps but i do have a better one
34589,no doubt youve been allowing the cleaners to kill off some of your people as well as the kangs for reasons which are at the moment beyond me but then im not a power crazed psychopath
34590,listen youre going to kill me anyway so you may as well make use of my brain
34591,im afraid ive got far too much to worry about deputy chief caretaker
34592,please stop
34593,how you do bin liner fire escape how did you get here
34594,not at all im delighted to see you oh whoops
34595,well kangs i must say theres no place like home and this is no place like home
34596,oh yes thank you fire escape but before we do anything else we must view the illustrated prospectus now which pocket did i put it in
34597,ah the openings not important bin liner wind it on
34598,miracle city
34599,kroagnon was a brilliant architect and miracle city his masterpiece only
34600,only he refused to move out and let anybody move in he thought that people would destroy the beauty of his work but they got him out only those who moved in lived to regret it
34601,yes nothing could be proven so he got away with it and as i said he was a brilliant architect and space is a big place so he got other work if course including paradise towers
34602,quite and then he disappeared mayhaps my dear red kangs mayhaps your parents thought they were being very clever by trapping him in his own building so he wouldnt finish it but if they did such a thing it was very foolish because no matter how deep they buried him in paradise towers hes bound to get out in the end
34603,more than that you must tell me all you know i mean that door with smoke coming out of it where is it please its important
34604,and seen what
34605,im going down to the basement to find out whats going on
34606,fire escape bin liner and air duct you come with me the rest stay here
34607,please please please this is no time for games the future of paradise towers is at stake we must all work together youve got to help us do you understand
34608,look youve got to believe me im sure the red kangs will agree that youve won this round of the game but there wont be any games worth playing if we dont discover whos ordering the killings will you let us go to the basement
34609,good then you will see with your own eyes whats going on
34610,we must hurry whats the quickest way to get there
34611,ah right to the basement build high for happiness
34612,back to the lift
34613,back
34614,just a moment please stop please the immediate dangers over i wouldnt mind getting my breath back
34615,very hot
34616,now you understand the dangerous position were in we must gather all the kangs together
34617,as himself yes but you saw what happened i mean up to now kroagnons simply been a mind without a body as your parents must have left him however i fear he may have spent his time down there devising a way of performing corpoelectroscopy a way of transplanting his brilliant brain to some host body
34618,i cant be certain but kroagnon wont want to stay locked up in his basement much longer hes bound to show himself in one form or another
34619,its taking over the building floor by floor
34620,is fire escape going to join us are all the kangs here red blue
34621,those whove been made unalive yes well when fire escape gets here we must all make for the great pool in the sky
34622,im sorry to give you such a shock mel but this is where the cleaner service lift appears to come out
34623,and you mel and you er how do you do
34624,ah i believe youve met my friends before         caretaker
34625,the rest of the towers would have been like this pool if hed had his way a killer in every corner
34626,oh very much so but we know so little about his plans hes had years to brood over what he wants to do but weve no time to come up with a counter plan
34627,thats paradise towers in a nutshell im afraid the red kangs didnt trust the blue kangs and none of them trusted the caretakers and the rezzies from your account prey on whoever they can and trust no one either and all of them despise poor old pex oh the great architect must be delighted how are we going to unite the people of paradise towers to defeat him
34628,and youre sure that person ordering the cleaners to do this looks like the chief caretaker
34629,exactly so the great architect has taken over his body
34630,please please be quiet shush be quiet
34631,well you kangs what do you say to that
34632,all agreed pex
34633,fire escape shush pex
34634,we have very little time so we must think clearly now kroagnon as we now must call the chief caretaker is firmly installed in your headquarters am i right deputy chief
34635,so we must find a way of getting him out again
34636,precisely
34637,first we must immobilise as many as we can
34638,yes
34639,they could be described thus yes
34640,we seem to be getting somewhere at last
34641,please please we must move on to the main problem how to persuade kroagnon to leave his safety and come to a place of our choosing where we can trap and defeat him
34642,well there is a way that might just work
34643,well you see kroagnon is undoubtedly a very clever and very proud being and like many clever and proud beings likes to be appreciated by his equals now i think if he had the chance to meet such a person he would leave his lair to do so
34644,ive no choice mel i mean in all honesty i am the only obvious candidate
34645,oh no no no that would be extremely futile i will allow myself to be seen and then somebody will go to kroagnon and offer to lead him to me right into our little trap now that person has a far more difficult and dangerous mission than i
34646,so be it     doctor
34647,now youre clear what you have to do pex
34648,remember pex you must get him out of the caretakers headquarters as quick as you can so that he doesnt see whats happening to the cleaners but then once hes out take as long as you can we need time no heroics just a cool clear head
34649,good luck pex
34650,yes
34651,id better give them a hand see what you can do to help the kangs down there oh and mel dont forget to leave the escape hatch uncovered so that i can make my exit i just hope that pex doesnt lose his nerve and hurry otherwise it wont be kroagnon whos caught in a booby trap itll be us
34652,i must tell the doctor
34653,oh pex move back quickly
34654,theres only one way this might work and for that i need to be on my own
34655,well now kroagnon how nice of you to drop in i am so glad i wanted to have a few words with you about the shoddy design of this building i mean take this door for instance look at it
34656,well speaking as an expert im prepared to tell the universe you couldnt design a simple doorknob i mean look
34657,indeed poor pex but look mel theyre all here the caretakers the rezzies the kangs this would never have happened before perhaps now theyll all start working together
34658,oh thank you very much
34659,oh a blue kang or a red kang
34660,ah well ill be honoured to wear it and all my best wishes to the future of paradise towers
34661,well you never can tell    ltback to the episode listing
34662,its strange how in some galaxies these tollports spring up all over the place like mushrooms yet in others you can go for light years without seeing a single one
34663,i think it relates to the way that space is being developed i mean there never has been a consistent three dimensional planning policy
34664,and by completely ignoring the overspill from the fourth dimension they sometimes build one port right on top of the other only realising it when theres an interface slippage
34665,yes it is serious i dont seem to have any change er take five credits from the kitty mel
34666,that kitty defies all known laws of physics i keep filling it up and its always empty mel theres something wrong only their landing lights are on       tollmaster
34667,get ready to run back into the tardis at the first sign of trouble
34668,whos there why dont you come out of the light and show yourself
34669,its a funny way to welcome your friends we thought youd been attacked by space pirates now about this toll fee
34670,you mean to say ten billion people have come here
34671,congratulations now about this toll fee
34672,a holiday yes a weeks holiday would be quite pleasant a green swarth a babbling brook birds twittering  doctor
34673,navarinos from the tribe on navarro squat wrinkly purply creatures wont they be a little conspicuous on earth
34674,whos that
34675,oh this is going to be very interesting
34676,nostalgia trips the most notorious travel firm in the five galaxies it was a nostalgia trip cruiser that got stuck with the glass eaters of tharl
34677,mel you go ahead on the bus ill follow on in the tardis
34678,well i simply applied the tardis vortex drive to generate an antigravity spiral to halt your descent sorry about the bumpy landing a miscalculation
34679,the satellite seems to have jammed your navigational pod ah hello mel nice trip
34680,no well according to my reckoning it seems to be somewhere in er wales
34681,maybe that series of primitive dwellings could be used as some sort of way station
34682,excellent just what were looking for
34683,oh dont go by appearances mel often the most interesting people stay at these places this is the real fifties
34684,im the doctor
34685,ah this is the cause of the problem an extremely crude low orbital satellite capable only of the most rudimentary of radio transmissions
34686,well you see that navipod it needs to be unbolted so we can replace the broken crystal
34687,now inside this box is the only quarb crystal this side of softel nebula
34688,ah well done now carefully does it
34689,do you always carry around a full set of tools with you
34690,a stitch in time fills up space
34691,well if you think it might help i could transport everyone in the tardis
34692,hmm well there is another alternative i could accelerate growth in the thermobooster and create a crystal in about er twenty four hours
34693,yes a most personable young lady practical too she seems very fond of you billy
34694,well it is home for the moment at least until the navipods fixed personally speaking i rather like it
34695,excellent
34696,have you managed to speak to her at all
34697,how appropriate
34698,i said for a primitive piece of technology it certainly delivers the decibels
34699,bad no rather nice in fact
34700,er have you known each other long
34701,come on lets go down to the front
34702,i was wondering ray if
34703,lovely dance
34704,ah you navarinos have a notoriously high metabolic rate
34705,excuse me murray
34706,there there theres many a slap twixt a cup and a lap ray
34707,if you kill for money let the girl go shes worth nothing to you
34708,do you feel all right nothing hurt or broken
34709,im afraid he was paid in kind you see this signal beacon it exploded from the inside obviously the bannermen locked into his signal and fired off a high impulse beam right along his transmission track
34710,im afraid so ionised
34711,yes a poignant reminder that violence always rebounds on itself but we must warn the others that an attack is imminent
34712,mel mel are you all right
34713,well im afraid thatll have to wait do you know where delta and billy have gone
34714,well weve got to find them as quick as we can and organise an evacuation of the camp the bannermen are on their way
34715,good but theyll be one short
34716,yes but i must try and find delta and billy do you know where they might be ray
34717,well were going to have to keep looking for them until we find them but first we must convince burton to evacuate the camp mel you find murray ray come with me
34718,an excellent summary mister burton now if you start right away then well be able to get them to safety
34719,i thought you might be a little skeptical what can i do to convince you
34720,listen mister burton if you dont act right away innocent people will die i will do whatever i can to convince you im not suffering from some sort of delusion
34721,of course but lets go quickly
34722,its called a tardis an acronym for time and relative dimensions in space
34723,yes with pleasure but first things first we must clear the camp
34724,i see youve got everything under control murray we must go and see the crystal if its ready then you must leave
34725,its almost regrown just another half hour and then youve got to leave whether i come back or not
34726,ive got to find delta mel you stay here and organise things come on lets go ray
34727,did you come here with billy often
34728,could it be hidden
34729,well theyre not here come on
34730,excuse me have you seen a couple go by a fellow on a big black bike and a lady with a green polka dot dress
34731,are there any other places ray
34732,well lets give it a try
34733,ah these tyre marks show a heavy motorcycle and sidecar come on
34734,found you at last
34735,yes we overheard a space mercenary give the position of the camp theres a price on your head
34736,murrays fixing the bus he shouldnt be long then you can leave so weve got to go back now
34737,stop stop stop stop hes not following us
34738,my immediate objectives are to set them free and find delta and the baby somewhere safe
34739,shush those marks behind her ear are high frequency antennae what are you picking up
34740,does he keep bees
34741,quick
34742,oh and im the doctor
34743,is it possible for these people to stay with you for a few hours
34744,im going to have to leave at once i wonder if you could lend me a pillowcase and a broom handle
34745,splendid oh billy may i borrow your bike
34746,ill treat it as if it were the tardis
34747,your charm is only matched by your compassion
34748,because youre in enough trouble already gavrok release those prisoners and i will testify that you showed some mercy
34749,we agree to differ but you should know that delta has sworn a statement alleging invasion and genocide of the chimerons you will be brought to account gavrok and made to pay for your actions
34750,life what do you know about life gavrok you deal in death lies treachery and murder are your currency you promise life but in the end it will be life which defeats you
34751,as you will i came here under a white flag and i will leave under that same white flag and woe betide any man who breaches its integrity now step aside release those prisoners
34752,yes theres more to this than we can fry mel
34753,no and i dont think they intended to
34754,which way that way
34755,in order to lengthen our odds may i borrow a length of your ribbon
34756,ah were not in the clear yet er ray tells me youve got some honey stored goronwy
34757,excellent billy ray you come with me and goronwy ive got one final thing to do
34758,she saved deltas life with a warning cry shes now into the singing time
34759,certainly wed better get back to the tardis so well get ready to leave immediately
34760,head em up roll em out
34761,stay back the tardis has been boobytrapped
34762,see up there next to the light theres a small beam weapon it emits a cone of sensitivity all round the tardis anything entering that cone detonates an explosion
34763,i dont know its a very sophisticated system
34764,i did warn you if youd have stepped into that beam youd have been atomised
34765,take everyone back to the camp
34766,let me stay here and try and work out how to diffuse that boobytrap because if it explodes with its full force it could take us all with it
34767,well i was marking out where the sonic cone meets the ground
34768,well you see the beam casts a shadow at the base of the tardis now if we could tunnel under the cone and come up in that shadow then perhaps i could disarm it
34769,yes i know its time consuming but its our only choice
34770,apart from plan b run
34771,oh excellent effort mister burton but the weapon were using will be a little more sophisticated are you ready billy
34772,right lets roll
34773,a moments impatience would mean our certain annihilation                doctor
34774,its over we won
34775,now come and see your new spaceship delta princess
34776,i know without a male the race will be wiped out but i havent seen many examples of species crossing there could be the most dreadful mutation
34777,i cant condone this foolishness but then love has never been known for its rationality
34778,i was just speculating what this vehicle would be like with more sophisticated braking and suspension systems
34779,no dont worry gavrok absorbed so much energy that the device has lost all its power
34780,oh what a sweet gesture oh youre more than a collector goronwy youre a man of taste
34781,i believe this is your satellite gentlemen
34782,iceworld a space trading colony on the dark side of the planet svartos space travellers stop there for supplies ive been picking up a faint tracking signal for some time i think theres something interesting going on there mel      announcer
34783,oh trust not appearances mel you never know what might be lurking in the freezer chests think gothic
34784,glitz
34785,ive regenerated the difference is purely perceptual
34786,whats this glitz not another one of your dodgy deals backfired
34787,you mean
34788,er steady on there mel
34789,glitz
34790,i think youd better pay back the money glitz
34791,why not
34792,youve only got yourself to blame
34793,oh really mel its fascinating travellers claim to have seen it throughout the centuries but theres never been any proof
34794,loch
34795,absolutely
34796,wont you get into trouble with your boss
34797,well i dont see why not
34798,treasure
34799,fascinating absolutely fascinating
34800,it shows the lower levels of iceworld
34801,the ice garden the singing trees
34802,wheres your sense of adventure glitz
34803,where
34804,my sentiments precisely whats your name incidentally
34805,oh how do you do im the doctor and this is my friend mel
34806,nonsense glitz time for a quick adventure then back for tea
34807,and i was so looking forward to meeting a dragon
34808,have you seen any singing trees or ice gardens glitz
34809,well since weve come from that direction i think we should go in that direction then again
34810,singing trees
34811,use your imagination glitz willow trees something like that
34812,air current causes the crystal membranes to vibrate
34813,yes whats it do
34814,yes some sort of optoelectronic circuit but why i mean whats it doing here
34815,possibly come on glitz tempus fugit i want to be back in time for tea
34816,glitz glitz glitz
34817,glitz i sympathise with your disappointment but im about to plummet to my death
34818,glitz
34819,glitz
34820,i say thank you
34821,why dont you explain the problem to him
34822,ah
34823,these types never have any sense of fair play
34824,ah hang on there a minute glitz im engaged in a project of scientific curiosity i mean that dragon or whatever it may turn out to be could be an undiscovered species
34825,you have me there glitz without the map ill never find the creature
34826,all right then wheres the nosferatu berthed
34827,ill do my best
34828,excuse me whats your attitude towards the nature of existence for example do you hold any strong theological opinions
34829,i see thats a very interesting concept
34830,well how do you reconcile that with the empirical critical belief that experience is at the root of all phenomena
34831,so what youre saying is that before plato existed someone had to have the idea of plato
34832,yes
34833,hello not interrupting anything am i
34834,thats a very difficult question why is everyone round here so preoccupied with metaphysics
34835,ah an existentialist
34836,oh i think he does i think he bought you like he buys everything in iceworld
34837,i think he bought you a long time ago he paid seventeen crowns for each of glitzs crew how much did he pay for you was it worth it were you worth it
34838,no glitz you cant go on stealing everything you want like this stradivarius and that dutch master pay kane back his debt even if it costs a thousand crowns ten thousand crowns pay back the debt and as for you your debt to kane i dont think youll be able to pay it off ever
34839,i think we go straight on  either that or we dont
34840,well im not absolutely certain this ones over yet
34841,no glitz dont
34842,weve got no right to kill
34843,perhaps wed better ask it
34844,ah mel youve brought my umbrella
34845,now now stop this squabbling theres no place for animosity on a serious scientific undertaking
34846,well its not so much a dragon as more of a semiorganic vertebrate with a highly developed cerebral cortex
34847,really well i wonder what you did to annoy it
34848,really well lets see what this vertebrate with laser beams has got to say for itself follow me
34849,cryogenesis eh
34850,its no good glitz ace says hes been cryogenically frozen
34851,its no use deep cryogenics freezes the neural pathways
34852,its completely impossible for him to recall any events prior to cryogenesis
34853,except in cases of overwhelming hatred or anger
34854,we dont mean you any harm do you understand
34855,well lets see what our new friend wants to show us shall we
34856,i think he wants us to watch
34857,ah so thats what this is all about a polydimensional scanning imager and our friend the creatures using itself as the energy source   targetblank daphne oxenford the voice of listen with mother when i was a child
34858,fascinating
34859,oh no no we might be deep beneath iceworld but kane could find his way here easily enough no the treasures got to be somewhere else somewhere beyond kanes reach what does he fear most
34860,precisely and what better way of protecting the real treasure than to leave a firebreathing dragon to guard it what better protection than if the dragon is the treasure
34861,am i right are you the one that everyones looking for treasure
34862,no look past the gold and the gemstone glitz look at the fire inside a source of intense optical energy    doctor
34863,theres something not right cant put my finger proamon proamon
34864,yes but where have i heard of it before i mean where was it was it in the past or is it in the future
34865,is a grain of sand important glitz i must go back and consult my star charts on the tardis
34866,a primitive star chart missing constellations orbital calculations i imagine ah yes i would like to see this
34867,er you stay here i shant be long
34868,now now now now now you stay here with them they can look after you so you dont get into any trouble glitz
34869,dont argue the three of you are safer together
34870,they always mark north and south on these things never backwards and forwards
34871,with silver bells and cockle shells and ice gardens all in a row extraordinary this must be a solar system theres a large red star with small orbiting planets constellations yes but that ones too high up theyre all slightly out of position this star charts no use any more how long have you been on this planet two thousand years longer
34872,oh you want to be leaving
34873,wheres glitz
34874,weve got to hurry we might be able to stop kane and save the creature
34875,back to the tardis
34876,the creature will always be under threat from kane unless we can convince him that his star charts are hopelessly wrong then we might be able to put an end to all this
34877,where is everyone must be half day closing i dont think weve got much time
34878,thats it proamon
34879,there is no planet proamon
34880,quiet there are things to be done
34881,come on
34882,later ace were in a hurry
34883,come on mel were wasting valuable time
34884,yes and it had a final surprise for anyone who wanted to try and interfere with it a huge energy surge when its head was disconnected
34885,well finish its job for it and put an end to all this death and destruction
34886,this is not good enough
34887,no doubt
34888,weve no choice the creatures already dead ace is still alive
34889,three thousand years eh long enough for an entire civilisation to have come and gone
34890,you know for someone whos had the patience to wait around for three thousand years you seem to be in rather a hurry suddenly
34891,three thousand years since you were exiled here from proamon along with the creature
34892,just a traveller
34893,no no no you should keep them for souvenir value along with the ice garden
34894,and without it you are powerless
34895,and the living creature was created to keep you prisoner
34896,look let me explain
34897,the logic is inescapable
34898,it sounds like a starflight photon drive
34899,vengeance on whom kane youre too late
34900,but where will you find another home planet
34901,was your home planet take a look at your navigational equipment its fully operative now
34902,sadly not your planet your people your entire race were destroyed one thousand years after you were exiled
34903,look at the sun of proamon when you left it was a cold red giant surrounded by freezing planets
34904,your sun turned supernova two thousand years ago and all its planets were engulfed in the explosion your people were annihilated your planet obliterated youre too late kane for your revenge you have no home time has flowed by
34905,time funny old business time it delights in frustrating your plans all kanes bitterness and hatred thwarted by a quirk of time
34906,oh
34907,yes well you could be right time for you to go
34908,well if you must go
34909,theres no point mel no point hanging around wasting time
34910,theres no time mel
34911,i do i usually do
34912,thats right yes youre going been gone for ages already gone still here just arrived havent even met you yet it all depends on who you are and how you look at it strange business time
34913,im sorry mel think about me when youre living your life one day after another all in a neat pattern think about the homeless traveller and his old police box with his days like crazy paving
34914,excellent yes mel can keep you out of trouble glitz
34915,glitz
34916,nonsense an idyllic place perivale its got lush green fields and a village blacksmith and
34917,oh
34918,but i dont have an address
34919,ace where do you think youre going
34920,ah yes but by which route the direct route with glitz or the scenic route well do you fancy a quick trip round the twelve galaxies and then back to perivale in time for tea
34921,but there are three rules one im in charge
34922,two im not the professor im the doctor
34923,and the third well ill think up the third by the time we get back to perivale
34924,your clothings a little anachronistic for this time period and that doesnt help
34925,strange
34926,youre not carrying any nitro nine explosives in there
34927,what do you make of that van
34928,no wrong type of aerial for this time period thats a very sophisticated piece of equipment
34929,lack of food makes you obstreperous why dont you go and buy some consumables theres a cafe down there while i undertake a detailed and scientific examination of that van that has so singularly failed to grab your attention
34930,ace
34931,money
34932,she doesnt talk to strangers very wise
34933,i thought so any possibility of natural phenomena
34934,so its artificial in origin
34935,yes
34936,the doctor
34937,how do you do im sure ive heard of you  gilmore
34938,ace get in here
34939,whats the situation
34940,im the doctor and this is ace you must be with the military
34941,im very perceptive
34942,no evidence of tissue damage ah massive internal displacement
34943,his insides were scrambled very nasty
34944,no a projected energy weapon
34945,very succinct i presume youve got reinforcements coming
34946,what a predictable response
34947,whatever fired that weapons trapped in there theres no way out
34948,ive been here before
34949,i dont think you realise what youre dealing with here
34950,down
34951,it doesnt matter how many men you get here it isnt going to make any difference
34952,thats the point group group captain it isnt even remotely human
34953,aim for the eyepiece ace give me some of that nitro nine that youre not carrying quickly
34954,i should hope so too er how long the fuse
34955,thats long enough
34956,oi dalek its me the doctor whats the matter dont you recognise your mortal enemy
34957,ace you said ten seconds
34958,yes of course i am can you drive
34959,good i thought so get in there
34960,a dalek only trouble is its the wrong dalek
34961,yes choke
34962,borrowing your van
34963,daleks
34964,from skaro at least originally theyre the mutated remains of a species called the kaleds left here
34965,no turn left here
34966,no left youve missed the turning
34967,why dont you concentrate on where youre going
34968,the kaleds were at war with the thals they had a dirty nuclear war the resulting mutations were then accelerated by their chief scientist davros what he created them he then placed them in a metal war machine and thats how the daleks came about
34969,exactly and ever since the daleks were created theyve tried to conquer and enslave as much as the universe as they can get their grubby protuberances on
34970,nothing so mundane they conquer the earth in the twenty second century no they want the hand of omega
34971,one thing at a time ace
34972,good afternoon
34973,the doctor and you
34974,references
34975,oh no were here for a completely different reason
34976,well we would like to look round your school if you dont mind
34977,weve got reason to believe there is a great evil at work somewhere in this school
34978,thank you
34979,yes theyre following me
34980,you can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies
34981,the burn marks see them well
34982,very good
34983,do you remember the zygon gambit with the lock ness monster or the yetis in the underground
34984,your species has the most amazing capacity for selfdeception matched by only its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself
34985,when i was here before i left something behind
34986,yes
34987,something very dangerous       computer
34988,shush whoever it was landed the spaceship in the playground
34989,more daleks
34990,ah the cellar it could be down in there
34991,good place to put things cellars
34992,the unknown
34993,probably but then if i knew what was down here i wouldnt have to look
34994,yes very elegant very advanced flux circuitry elements
34995,its a transmat a matter transmitter but transmitting from where within about three hundred kilometres
34996,very likely it has an automatic activator what youre right something is beginning to come through
34997,excellent
34998,i sincerely doubt that if i can just get the transmitter to dephase at the critical point
34999,any moment now quick down
35000,yes the dephase must have caused an overload
35001,well i persuaded one half of the dalek to materialise where its other half was materialising the two halves tried to coexist at the same point the resulting reaction destroyed it dangerous things transmats
35002,well itll slow them down a bit until the operator can repair the systems
35003,yes the daleks usually leave an operator on station in case of any malfunctions
35004,yes
35005,the stairs
35006,whats the matter with him
35007,school dinners give me a hand
35008,ace
35009,what are you doing here oh never mind get this thing out of here
35010,atrs antitank rockets
35011,its not the daleks were after its the transmat
35012,come on
35013,quite possibly stay close behind
35014,ace get down
35015,you destroyed it
35016,no
35017,it is not good nothing about this is good ive made a grave error of judgment oh im going to wish id never started all this group captain i must ask you to evacuate the immediate area
35018,ive reason to believe a major dalek task force could soon be operating here
35019,one certainly is in place hidden somewhere in this vicinity the other probably from a mothership in geostationary orbit
35020,do you doubt the nonterrestrial nature of the daleks i mean examine this one or better still ask your scientific advisor
35021,splendid
35022,i shouldnt touch it if i were you it may not be completely dormant yet
35023,so have i ill return in the morning
35024,to bury the past
35025,it is not your past you havent been born yet would someone look after ace for me
35026,ill borrow this
35027,a mug of tea please
35028,yes it is bitter very bitter wheres harry
35029,of course itll be twins
35030,ah a decision would it make any difference
35031,yes but beyond the confines of my tastebuds would it make any difference
35032,but
35033,what if i could control peoples tastebuds what if i decided that no one would take sugar thatd make a difference to those who sell the sugar and those that cut the cane
35034,exactly now if no one had used sugar your father wouldnt have been a cane cutter
35035,see every great decision creates ripples like a huge boulder dropped in a lake the ripples merge rebound off the banks in unforeseeable ways the heavier the decision the larger the waves the more uncertain the consequences
35036,did you see that
35037,nothing what would you do if you had a decision a big decision
35038,saving the world
35039,really
35040,lets hope i make the right decision things could get unpleasant round here id take a holiday if i were you
35041,two or three days after that it wont matter one way or the other thanks for the tea
35042,good morning i believe this belongs to you
35043,the door was open so i thought id just pop in and collect my casket
35044,yes that would be perfectly all right
35045,doctor
35046,yes now if i might be alone with the
35047,thank you
35048,yes
35049,goodbye close
35050,its very good of you to do this at such short notice
35051,i had to leave suddenly
35052,yes it has changed several times
35053,yes
35054,no its only just beginning
35055,working unlike some people
35056,i was not wandering the streets i was merely contemplating certain local cartographic anomalies
35057,ah ace i have a present for you
35058,higher technology and no i cant tell you how
35059,youre not ready for it no one on this planet is
35060,ill meet you outside
35061,ace im trying to convince group captain gilmore to keep his men out of trouble otherwise therell be a lot of needless deaths
35062,yes
35063,no
35064,will you obey me this once ill explain everything when i return
35065,i havent got the time
35066,trust me
35067,or
35068,with respect group captain your careers magnificently irrelevant now lets see any more transmission sites
35069,good i want a direct line to jodrell bank lets see 1963 the fylingdale installations and the royal observatory order them to search these localities for any signs of high orbital activity
35070,goodbye civilisation as you know it
35071,twenty six by zero zero one a big mothership of some kind with maybe as many as four hundred daleks on board well at least we know where it is
35072,that ship has weapons capable of cracking open this planet like an egg
35073,good over here
35074,for one group at least i believe were dealing with two antagonistic dalek factions
35075,from another planet in a distant future we must try and contain them let them destroy each other
35076,have you been listening to me group captain that spaceship up there has surveillance equipment capable of spotting a sparrow fall at fifteen thousand kilometres any sign of a military buildup and they may simply decide to sterilise the area
35077,frightening isnt it to find there are others better versed in death than human beings          dalek
35078,well at best it will interfere with the daleks control systems i rigged something like it on spiridon
35079,itll do absolutely nothing
35080,where
35081,mike phone up ace and tell her someone will come and collect her
35082,multiple theyve got the transmat working again
35083,more daleks
35084,get a vehicle ready load it up with plastic explosives and integral detonators
35085,well that thing merely disorients and weakens them what do you expect me to do then talk to them sternly
35086,it works it works
35087,there were living beings in there
35088,yes sergeant
35089,hmm
35090,oh lets see professor
35091,theyve mutated again here come and have a look compare that to the destroyed dalek at totters lane note the difference
35092,sergeant smith must have found some more daleks
35093,you two go down and check the cellar but dont touch anything ill look after ace
35094,where is it
35095,good
35096,that tape deck was a dangerous anachronism if someone had found it and discovered the principles of its function the whole microchip revolution would take place now twenty years too early with incalculable damage to the time line
35097,so ace the daleks have a mothership up there capable of eradicating this planet from space but even they ruthless though they are would think twice before making such a radical alteration to the time line
35098,lovely flowers begonias
35099,its a link for the daleks allowing them to beam death squads onto earth without anybody knowing and i dont want them here just yet
35100,concentrating
35101,group captain we need to establish a forward base at the school can it be done
35102,thank you for your cooperation
35103,well now that ive disabled the transmat absolutely nothing as long as the renegade daleks have got the hand of omega then the imperial daleks attention will be focused on that
35104,yes
35105,yes
35106,keeping an eye on group captain chunky gilmore although why his men call him chunky ive no idea
35107,a long time ago on my home planet of gallifrey there lived a stellar engineer called omega
35108,ace
35109,it was omega who created the supernova that was the initial power source for gallifreyan time travel experiments he left behind him the basis on which rassilon founded time lord society and he left behind the hand of omega
35110,no no not his hand literally no no its called that because time lords have an infinite capacity for pretension
35111,the hand of omega is a mythical name for omegas remote stellar manipulator a device used to customise stars with and didnt we have trouble with the prototype
35112,they
35113,oh yes daleks have got time corridor technology but its very crude and nasty what they want is the power that time lords have and theyll get that with the hand of omega or so they think
35114,no ace i want them to have it
35115,my problem is trying to stop group captain gilmore and his men getting diced in the crossfire
35116,a massive deception yes
35117,just one thing
35118,i didnt expect two dalek factions and now ive got to make sure the wrong ones dont get their grubby little protuberances on it
35119,no dalek hunting is a terminal pastime
35120,dalek hunting
35121,this way
35122,might as well
35123,daleks
35124,the hand of omegas inside this box the most powerful and sophisticated remote stellar control manipulator device ever constructed
35125,absolutely you know what youve got to do dont you
35126,in a manner of speaking yes
35127,some kind of biomechanoid control system for a small human of course its a battle computer
35128,the daleks major drawback is their dependency on rationality and logic the solution get a human preferably young imaginative plug the child into the system and their ingenuity and creativity are slaved to the battle computer
35129,its obscene ah now for the time controller
35130,its a device the renegade daleks use to travel through time theyve come a long way
35131,no no no i dont want to lumber earth with a load of desperate daleks ive merely put it out of phase theyll be able to fix it but itll slow them down    ratcliffe
35132,with a bit of luck the imperial daleks will wipe out the renegade faction besides i cant just roll up and give it to them they get suspicious
35133,shush
35134,yes
35135,no no no weve got work to do anyway here come the military
35136,dalek hunting now its the other way around is gilmore back at the school
35137,good well go back and smooth his troubled brow
35138,moderately so im afraid weve brought back some daleks with us
35139,how did you know that sergeant
35140,it can wait
35141,on a reentry curve from low orbit
35142,thatll be the imperial dalek shuttlecraft
35143,here no were much too far from the main action
35144,ace get away from the window down
35145,no thats a shuttle the motherships much larger are you willing to cooperate with me now
35146,well you could go down there and make a gloriously futile gesture yes
35147,a little bit of piracy
35148,elementary piracy my dear allison dalek shuttles have massive ground defences and an unguarded service hatch on top now once im down there ill attempt to open that hatch ace you come after then gilmore followed by allison and rachel any questions no good
35149,im not human
35150,yes
35151,correct
35152,goodbye
35153,i shorted it out daleks are such boring conversationalists
35154,yes theyre not known for their aesthetic sense lets see what they were up to
35155,oh ive turned those off come on jump
35156,i rigged the communications relay to the shuttle control system we can monitor the daleks on the transmat in the cellar
35157,i can do anything i like
35158,hell be fine rachel and allison i need your help
35159,ah you brought it then put it down there
35160,yes
35161,ace
35162,blobs
35163,result
35164,well er ace lets go and see which blobs are winning
35165,do what
35166,its easy when you have nine hundred years experience
35167,hes got the time controller typical human you can always count on them to mess things up get after him stay with him see where hes going
35168,oh ace
35169,no heroics ive got enough problems already
35170,provided everything goes according to my plan
35171,its a surprise
35172,how do i look dont answer do you mind youre in my shot
35173,oh davros i am far more than just another time lord
35174,powerful crush the lesser races conquer the galaxy unimaginable power unlimited rice pudding et cetera et cetera  davros
35175,dont worry i know what im doing
35176,i programmed the hand of omega to fly into skaros sun and turn it supernova
35177,the resulting explosion destroyed skaro and the feedback destroyed the mothership the hand of omega is now returning to gallifrey
35178,not this time i started this   the doctor gets out of the van as the little girl enters the front room and smiles at ace he walks down the street towards the dalek
35179,your forces are destroyed your home planet a burnt cinder circling a dead sun
35180,even davros your creator is dead
35181,youre trapped a trillion miles and a thousand years from a disintegrated home
35182,i have defeated you you no longer serve any purpose
35183,ashes to ashes dust to dust

35279,protected against everything that is except from the intense heat from that open oven behind you
35280,i said protected against everything except for the intense heat from the open oven behind you
35281,and of course the adhesive effect of carbonated h2o and citric acid lemonade to you
35282,sweet dreams
35283,its crystallised sugar this pipe must have carried some sort of syrup what do you think

35360,how long is it since you were last on this planet
35361,so this represents six months worth of helen as handiwork a list of the disappeared
35362,its still the same old story a fight for love or glory a case of do or die
35363,thank you earl everythings beginning to fall into place as time goes by
35364,you dont know how happy i am to see you ace
35365,its all right ace they cant shoot me because they see before them a happy man and their logic tells them twisted though it be that as such they have no power over me i may have been some time ago a little grouchy perhaps a little badtempered but not today no because today the doctor and the drones are having a ball
35366,weltschmertz all except susan q and ace who are happy to see me
35367,to the top
35368,ah wulfric wences
35369,fifi that wouldnt be fifi as in fifi the annoyed rat you claim to have blown to smithereens
35370,including fifi
35371,precisely
35372,shush whisper

35374,i want you to go down the other end with the pipe people
35375,take susie q with you come on run
35376,no a flat
35377,resonance sympathetic vibrations havent you read the paper of doctor john wallace to the royal society in 1677 quickly
35378,yes keep playing
35379,kandyman i dont believe youve met my young friend ace an expert in calorification incineration carbonisation and inflammation
35380,shes come to look at your oven
35381,that may be kandyman but the last time we met you said you were going to kill me
35382,i agree you are a pimple head
35383,tails well
35384,youre playing a dangerous game kandyman that redhot poker could cut through you like a knife through butterscotch
35385,quick ace open the oven door
35386,oh hell keep hes full of colouring flavouring and preservative
35387,ah not quite i can hear the sound of empires toppling
35388,wanton destruction of public property certainly not
35389,yes this is where we get in
35390,no protests soon youll be back in the sugar fields
35391,yes it sounds like a shuttle
35392,ah i was looking for helen a perhaps you could tell her
35393,susan q who taught you to shoot like that
35394,oh thank you daisy k
35395,splendid
35396,you cant get away helen a
35397,oh i know i cant but its not me youre running away from
35398,yourself thats why youll never escape
35399,oh they understood you only too well thats why they resisted you
35400,the best prisons death squads executions
35401,dont you ever feel like weeping helen a
35402,why
35403,what were these opportunities you gave them a bag of sweets a few tawdry party games bland soulless music do these things make you happy of course they dont because theyre cosmetic happiness is nothing unless it exists side by side with sadness
35404,im sure you will helen a
35405,where there is no compassion
35406,a place where there is no love
35407,fifi
35408,tis done
35409,its been a long night and i think we ought to be off what about you earl
35410,hmm
35411,oh yes there are no other colours without the blues
35412,happiness will prevail  ltback to the episode listing
35413,and so we shall
35414,this is my favourite kind of jazz straight blowing
35415,whats this its a reminder
35416,well obviously at this precise moment its a reminder to change course for another destination
35417,ive forgotten oh well have to go back and find out
35418,dont you find it embarrassing asking for autographs
35419,well i probably arranged it centuries ago
35420,get down
35421,couldnt see quick the tardis
35422,welcome home
35423,no duck
35424,afraid not
35425,yes i know i built it for you to replace the one that was destroyed by the daleks but
35426,this is more than just a tape deck and besides weve more to worry about than just listening to your tape
35427,im afraid theres an infinite number of possibilities what concerns me more is my alarm got to find out what it was supposed to be
35428,im afraid not obviously the arrangements were made in rather a hurry they are important ive given them a terminal rating
35429,it means that some planet somewhere faces imminent destruction
35430,quite
35431,ive been busy
35432,well in strictly linear terms as the chronometer flies ive known since november the twenty third 1638
35433,yes thats exactly what weve got to do look at all this stuff you take that aisle
35434,presents
35435,well if you were a lady who travelled
35436,yes youre not always invited but you are you get presents and then you need somewhere to store them
35437,windsor
35438,this is new
35439,it probably is upstairs but were in the vault
35440,its only temporary
35441,listen ace do i have to remind you that the safety of the world is at stake
35442,precisely
35443,no that was the return to earth of a comet called nemesis that has been in orbit for exactly three hundred and fifty years
35444,wasnt difficult really it was me who launched it into space in the first place this may qualify as the worst miscalculation since life crawled out of the seas on this sad planet
35445,for once legend is absolutely correct it has just returned
35446,ill tell you three hundred and fifty years ago
35447,there might be someone at home
35448,windsor of course only a few hundred yards from the castle
35449,it certainly is and furthermore dont move
35450,stay where you are
35451,something you dont want to see
35452,a lady
35453,lady peinfortes nothing if not original im afraid this poor man was employed for his useful rather than his ornamental qualities hes a scholar hes done remarkably well in a matter of months since i was last here hes calculated the exact time and date when a comet called nemesis will land on this planet the twenty third of november
35454,and lady peinfortes rewarded him with her usual generosity
35455,hmm oh no no not to her to a statue of her she made the statue from the silver metal that fell out of the sky into that meadow out there
35456,dont worry theres no one here now apart from our late friend lady peinfortes around all right in windsor but three hundred and fifty years in the future
35457,she uses the silver arrow of course and she had some basic rudimentary knowledge about time travel black magic mostly
35458,mmm and what you might call a nose for secrets
35459,unfortunately lady peinforte discovered it was something rather more unusual a living metal validium
35460,yes with just one purpose destruction
35461,later ace
35462,d�j� vu
35463,oh very droll i havent been here since they were building the place you remember the way around
35464,quite right what we needs a guide come on
35465,this way what do you think
35466,act as if you own the place
35467,it always works we own the place
35468,how annoying i cant place that woman for the life of me
35469,its all right ace i know that woman from somewhere    doctor
35470,theres no alternative
35471,but i am a doctor
35472,i could tell you but you wont believe me
35473,i travelled through time and space
35474,oh yes very well then lets forget about the armed forces
35475,listen the fate of every living creature on this planet hangs in the balance
35476,you will believe me you will let us go you will not move  you will move
35477,its easy once you know how you have to make a spectacle of yourself
35478,only trouble is it doesnt last long
35479,back to the tardis were obviously not going to get any help here
35480,what gosh so it is my goodness what a good likeness
35481,well it hasnt happened yet
35482,i know we havent done it thats why you dont remember it
35483,well it did to louis armstrong but then he really understood time
35484,i only hope were not to late
35485,fortunately i havent seen it since 1638 when it disappeared along with the good lady peinforte
35486,she really doesnt allow me to explain ace
35487,and the arrow now if someone could put the bow and arrow into the statues hands
35488,i simply notice what is obvious you apparently dont
35489,you see those policemen there theyve been attacked by technology more advanced and more terrible than you could imagine
35490,and you might also have observed the electricity supply being drained over the last few days
35491,yes
35492,im glad to say i cant
35493,dont move
35494,dont thank them yet we might live to regret it
35495,cybermen
35496,take cover
35497,we certainly can this exactly the same thing that happened the last time only then it was the roundheads and lady peinforte
35498,where did that come from
35499,a cyberman killed with an arrow but thats ludicrous unless of course the heads made of gold
35500,yes the only substance to which theyre vulnerable
35501,ah gold dipped in poison lady peinfortes calling card
35502,i really think youre right
35503,were just passing through ace
35504,yes someones moved the chess pieces
35505,our friend the mathematician was a genius but he needed a little help to get started
35506,yes  he moves a piece on the chess board and they leave
35507,validium was created as the ultimate defence for gallifrey back in early times
35508,yes
35509,rassilon
35510,and none of it should have left gallifrey but as always with these things some of it did
35511,or anyone else
35512,yes so i launched the largest piece into space
35513,look were almost there
35514,well the cybermen might find the tardis this way our validium leads us to their validium
35515,im an oldfashioned guy
35516,you should see the ones theyre communicating with
35517,yes but if we could only jam their signal have you got a tape
35518,of course it does i built it
35519,are we having fun
35520,oh i do love a jam session
35521,just in time
35522,i dont suppose youve completely ignored my instructions and secretly prepared any nitro nine have you
35523,naturally you wouldnt do anything so insanely dangerous as to carry it around with you would you
35524,excellent blow up that vehicle
35525,hello im the doctor i believe you want to kill me
35526,they were dead already the cybermen had transformed them they were no longer human beings
35527,probably they were like people themselves before they turned themselves into cybermen quite a lot of human beings are trying to follow their example
35528,good lets see whos listening to it
35529,anything there
35530,that handful back there arent the only cybermen in the universe weve got to find out where the others are
35531,right
35532,then the scanners wrong that lot were only the advance party out there somewheres the entire cyberforce and they want the nemesis more than anything else in space
35533,because its 1988
35534,listen ace the nemesis generates destruction it affects everything around it i launched it into space but unfortunately with an orbit that brings it back to earth every twenty five years take the twentieth century it appeared in 1913
35535,twenty five years later
35536,hitler annexes austria
35537,kennedy assassinated
35538,check the scanner again
35539,of course its so simple theyre shrouded
35540,shrouded they dont show up but we must try and force them into revealing themselves treble bass please let me be right is anyone listening balance
35541,cyber warships thousands of them they were invisible
35542,i think our best move is to go to the crypt unarmed with the bow
35543,weve got to get the bow into the statues hands in order to activate the validium
35544,i believe in the direct approach you can always go back to the tardis
35545,ace
35546,oh ace im sorry forgive me why dont you go back to the tardis youll be safe there whatever happens
35547,good afternoon
35548,yes here we are im sorry we couldnt have been here earlier but we were held up on the way i dont believe youve met my friend ace

35559,but pawn takes queen
35560,checkmate black wins time to go take those gold coins we may need them
35561,ah now the statue should be here any moment now everything depends on my final calculations i cant get my figures wrong this time
35562,you are interrupting me
35563,theres also another slight problem the cybermen could be here at any moment
35564,aim at the chest panel and i trust you remember my strict instructions never to cause any further explosions
35565,good were ready for anything          remington
35566,now ah yes the bow the bow the bow is essential you shall have the bow

35571,enough
35572,not yet
35573,i told you when
35574,no
35575,ah
35576,well actually i would have arranged to have the bow neatly placed in front of the rocket sled then i would have arranged the rockets to test fire at a prearranged time by the way ace what is the time
35577,not to the likes of you
35578,if i give you the bow
35579,its all over ace my battle all my battles ive lost i can only surrender

35586,stand back shes ready for launching
35587,certainly
35588,yes i gave your instructions to the nemesis and it understood them it understood them and disobeyed them and destroyed the cyberfleet
35589,its worth it
35590,i know how you feel however
35591,back to 1638
35592,anythings possible
35593,i suppose i did how clever of me
35594,as i said ace unfinished business
35595,yes  ace
35596,no            doctor
35597,how extraordinary
35598,not entirely no
35599,yes junk mail gets everywhere
35600,oh ace i thought youd have been interested in the circus
35601,what you found them funny
35602,i think youre being very unfair a lot of the acts in the circus require a great deal of skill and courage thats something you should appreciate anyway i rather fancy entering the festival talent contest myself
35603,shall we just fling it away and forget about it i mean im sure the psychic circus isnt scary at all its just a device to get us to go
35604,so this is segonax not quite the green and pleasant land wed been led to expect still ive had good reports of the friendliness of the natives
35605,oh i expect thats for those not fortunate enough to possess a tardis
35606,ill ask for directions over there
35607,lets not be hasty
35608,elementary diplomacy my dear ace she apparently thinks were a pair of undesirable intergalactic hippies we must try and convince her were nice cleanliving people who eat up all our fresh fruit and pay our way
35609,every last bite besides we want the charming lady to tell us how to find the circus dont we delicious madam quite delicious
35610,er no delicious but extremely filling im sure you will have gathered by now dear lady were not the kind of hobbledyhoys and vagabonds you take such exception to indeed as i said before im known as the doctor
35611,yes well be that as it may we would appreciate your help you see were looking for
35612,go where
35613,i dont understand you say that hes going to the circus
35614,is it far this appalling spectacle
35615,no no the very idea no just a moment would you excuse me
35616,no not really no
35617,well theres nothing like a nice walk in the countryside
35618,now now now it could be worse you could be carrying that heavy rucksack of yours
35619,they seem to be in rather a hurry looking for customers
35620,thats true but then how do they expect a hard case like him to going to the circus anyway
35621,something evils happened here i can feel it
35622,who knows
35623,greetings im the doctor and this is my friend ace
35624,well i could be wrong of course but isnt it from the groz valley of melogothon
35625,oh ace wait a minute

35628,i said why bother to come here
35629,do you often travel together
35630,of what
35631,i never think of ace as a specimen of anything
35632,i suppose it was buried for some good reason
35633,quick help captain
35634,ive seen ones like this quite often enough thank you very much
35635,a shrine or not i cant help feeling something sinister happened here
35636,not everything i trust my instincts and you may recall theyre not always wrong
35637,ace i wouldnt
35638,i would like a ticket actually id like a there and back off peak weekend break supersaver senior citizen bimonthly season with optional added facilities a free cup of coffee in a plastic glass a crocodile sandwich and make it snappy you mechanic moron
35639,some people cant bear to be proved wrong
35640,oh lets not bear a grudge he cant help being a pompous selfish selfsatisfied meddler
35641,if a little odd
35642,do you like it
35643,well if the keepers not here the finder has it
35644,presumably whoever attacked them destroyed them and wrecked the bus
35645,yes i think so anyway whoever left him here on guards gone now perhaps millennia ago
35646,im afraid i think not no that was all just good publicity
35647,yes i feel just in the right mood and after two brushes with death in one day i hope you might be
35648,ah so doctor you can remember
35649,not as far as we feared look

35696,what about you i mean why didnt you speak up
35697,what is all this then i thought there was a talent contest going on
35698,what a fool ive been
35699,i should have listened to ace
35700,what happens in there
35701,in the ring during the talent contest
35702,you were lucky captain
35703,what am i supposed to do with these
35704,why do they let you out again
35705,it frightens you doesnt it mags
35706,you saw what happened in there
35707,arent you going to tell me about it
35708,what do you mean
35709,is this what you saw before
35710,would you let something like that happen to you
35711,ready
35712,no youre not
35713,i insist on going out first
35714,oh yes i do
35715,i am
35716,no oh we should have made straight away for the open air i suppose
35717,how extraordinary theyre just like the stones in the big top fascinating i wonder how long theyve been here
35718,that thought had occurred to me lets investigate
35719,see what
35720,the moon why does it frighten you tell me
35721,oh nasty little booby trap that that is if it is a booby trap still theres certainly no way forward
35722,one way to find out
35723,but we were on the edge of discovering the secret of the psychic circus doesnt that interest you at all
35724,of course of course
35725,fun for all the family i dont know how theyve got the nerve
35726,hello deadbeat fancy meeting you here small world isnt it it frightened you to see that eye didnt it it means the powers behind it are on the move again something happened to you here you havent always been like this did you try and find something out were you punished can you understand anything im saying well theres one thing i do know deadbeat youre not going to give me away to the others are you
35727,lead on deadbeat
35728,deadbeat i take it all back  youre absolutely right clowns can be creepy
35729,something went wrong
35730,and a friendly hippy circus was turned into a trap for killing people
35731,and the well
35732,you dont know anything about a well with an eye peering out from inside
35733,listen ace
35734,the answers you know what happened dont you deadbeat
35735,deadbeat if we take you to the well can you show us what it did
35736,well he brought me here to you and bellboy he must have done that for a purpose
35737,ah now theres something there ace i saw it when he looked into the crystal ball
35738,there might be something in that yes anyway wed better be going bellboy
35739,so be it then bellboy come on deadbeat or should i call you kingpin weve got work to do
35740,now kingpin show us what you did when you first saw the eye
35741,he must have used that medallion to summon the powers that lurk here
35742,yes
35743,yes that eye seems to plague us everywhere only with the eyeball removed by someone or something
35744,in the bus
35745,its so tantalising im so close to understanding it all and yet so far
35746,exactly now you take kingpin back to the bus and find it but be careful
35747,im going back to the ring
35748,the psychic circus needs acts if theyve got me then perhaps they wont worry about you two for the moment
35749,anybody remotely interesting is mad in someway or another
35750,i believe youve been looking for me im wanted backstage
35751,i know mags and i havent wasted the time you bought me and i have returned with an idea i suggest that this time we all three work together
35752,up to now all the people in the cage have been played off against each other and of course some people are cleverer at preserving themselves than others
35753,not entirely what im proposing is that we all three go into the ring three for one and one for three that should throw a very big hammer into the works
35754,those powers destroyed deadbeat
35755,youre meddling with things you dont understand
35756,captain cook
35757,youre not only a scoundrel and a meddling fool but youre also a crushing bore
35758,mags mags do you hear me mags
35759,no mags no
35760,come on mags weve got to run away now
35761,mags
35762,something dreadfuls happening in the ring things are getting out of control quicker than i expected  dad
35763,no you must run and get ace and deadbeat
35764,how many people have you destroyed i wonder before kingpin was lured down here poor kingpin thats what you like isnt it taking someone with a touch of individuality and imagination and wearing them down to nothingness in your service
35765,enough ive hardly started i have fought the gods of ragnarok all through time
35766,dont tell me what you want me to do let me guess now let me see you want me to
35767,predictable as ever gods of ragnarok as i think its been said before or was it after anyway you aint seen nothin yet
35768,thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for that overwhelming reception and now i would like to begin like life at the beginning but how did life begin was it with a chicken or was it with
35769,youre not interested in beginnings youre only interested in endings
35770,what no complaints no arguments no thunderbolts
35771,let me guess give yourself enough rope and you hang yourself
35772,a piece of rope has two ends father ragnarok
35773,yes
35774,really i thought i was entertaining you
35775,do you now
35776,do i have your full attention
35777,the climax of my act gods of ragnarok requires something you do not possess in great abundance that is imagination and it starts with a piece of metal this piece of metal once belonged to a sword and that sword belonged to a gladiator
35778,i have fed you enough gods of ragnarok and you found what i have to offer indigestible so i have taken myself off the menu la comedia e finita
35779,i already have
35780,probably not its all a matter of timing dont you know
35781,yes but youre just about to start
35782,what better way for a circus to begin than with a wonderful new act
35783,oh you can mags you already have
35784,thank you kingpin but im afraid weve got other galaxies to travel and besides i find circuses a little sinister  ltback to the episode listing
35785,quiet ace im working
35786,yes
35787,a cry in the dark
35788,a cry for help perhaps a summoning
35789,earth rippling out through the cosmos forward in time backwards in time and sideways in time
35790,yes sideways in time across the boundaries that divide one universe from another
35791,for i dont know
35792,earth a few years in your future
35793,well know in a moment once weve deciphered it  voice
35794,too late weve already arrived  the tardis materialises by a sign post  lake vortigern 4 km
35795,i dont think thisll stop either
35796,north east

36682,antiplastic
36683,antiplastic but first ive got to find it how can you hide something that big in a city this small
36684,the transmitter the consciousness is controlling every single piece of plastic so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal
36685,like a transmitter round and massive slap bang in the middle of london
36686,still weve found the transmitter the consciousness must be somewhere underneath
36687,looks good to me
36688,im not here to kill it ive got to give it a chance

36708,right then you asked for it i know exactly where to go hold on
36709,you lot you spend all your time thinking about dying like youre going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or asteroids but you never take time to imagine the impossible that maybe you survive this is the year five point five slash apple slash twenty six five billion years in your future and this is the day
36710,depends what you mean by people
36711,aliens
36712,its not really a spaceship more like an observation deck the great and the good are gathering to watch the planet burn

36844,checking for strings
36845,oh come on charles all right i shouldnt have told you to shut up im sorry but youve got one of the best minds in the world you saw those gas creatures
36846,and what does the human body do when it decomposes it breaks down and produces gas perfect home for these gas things they can slip inside and use it as a vehicle just like your driver and his coach
36847,not wrong theres just more to learn
36848,but its getting stronger more powerful is that right
36849,you grew up on top of the rift youre part of it youre the key
36850,well that should help you can show us what to do
36851,were going to have a s�ance
36852,humbug come on open mind

36867,close and theyve been trying to get through from brecon to cardiff but the roads blocked only a few can get through and even then theyre weak they can only test drive the bodies for so long then they have to revert to gas and hide in the pipes
36868,but she can help living on the rift shes become part of it she can open it up make a bridge and let them through
36869,good system it might work
36870,why not its like recycling
36871,seriously though i can
36872,do you carry a donor card
36873,it is different yeah its a different morality get used to it or go home you heard what they said times short i cant worry about a few corpses when the last of the gelth could be dying
36874,you dont have to do anything
36875,we need to find the rift this house is on a weak spot so there must be a spot thats weaker than any other mister sneed whats the weakest part of this house the place where most of the ghosts have been seen

36933,yes we are
36934,oi im trying to listen    reporter
36935,nowhere its just a bit human in there for me history just happened and theyre talking about where you can buy dodgy topup cards for half price im off on a wander thats all
36936,nothing to do with me its not an invasion that was a genuine crash landing angle of descent colour of smoke everything its perfect
36937,so maybe this is it first contact the day mankind officially comes into contact with an alien race im not interfering because youve got to handle this on your own thats when the human race finally grows up just this morning you were all tiny and small and made of clay now you can expand
36938,tell you what tardis key its about time you had one see you later
36939,shush
36940,spread out tell the perimeter its a lockdown
36941,do it     soldier 2
36942,coma shock hibernation anything what does it look like
36943,more like a mermaid victorian showmen used to draw the crowds by taking the skull of a cat gluing it to a fish and calling it a mermaid now someones taken a pig opened up its brain stuck bits on then theyve strapped it in that ship and made it dive bomb it mustve been terrified theyve taken this animal and turned it into a joke
36944,all right so i lied i went and had a look but the whole crash landings a fake i thought so just too perfect i mean hitting big ben come on so i thought lets go and have a look

36954,well shut it then
36955,got it ha ha patched in the radar looped it back twelve hours so we can follow the flight of that spaceship here we go hold on come on
36956,it means it came from earth in the first place it went up and came back down whoever those aliens are they havent just arrived theyve been here for a while the question is what have they been doing
36957,all the basic packages
36958,yes i get the football hold on i know that lot  woman

36975,of course the really interesting bit happened three days ago see filed away under any other business the north sea a satellite detected a signal a little blip of radiation at one hundred fathoms like theres something down there you were just about to investigate and the next thing you know this happens spaceships pigs massive diversion from what
36976,if aliens fake an alien crash and an alien pilot what do they get us they get us its not a diversion its a trap
36977,this is all about us alien experts the only people with knowledge how to fight them gathered together in one room
36978,oi if you want aliens youve got them theyre inside downing street come on
36979,i think you will find the prime minister is an alien in disguise thats never going to work is it  policeman 2
36980,well now yes you see er the thing is if i was you if i was going to execute someone by backing them against the wall between you and me little word of advice

36986,can i have a bit of hush
36987,so whats the plan
36988,i said hush come on youve got a spaceship hidden in the north sea its transmitting a signal youve murdered your way to the top of government what for invasion
36989,then somethings brought the slitheen race here what is it
36990,so youre family
36991,then youre out to make a profit how can you do that on a godforsaken rock

36999,sorry right what have we got any terminals anything
37000,hes too slim theyre big old beasts they need to fit inside big humans
37001,thats the device around their necks compression field literally shrinks them down a bit thats why theres all that gas its a big exchange
37002,harriet jones ive heard that name before harriet jones youre not famous for anything are you
37003,rings a bell harriet jones
37004,say that again
37005,anything all of it

37017,that lot wouldve gathered for a weather balloon you dont need to crash land in the middle of london
37018,now then on the left at the top theres a tab an icon little concentric circles click on that
37019,the slitheen have got a spaceship in the north sea and its transmitting that signal now hush let me work out what its saying
37020,dont know its on a loop keeps repeating
37021,im trying
37022,right if were going to find their weakness we need to find out where theyre from which planet so judging by their basic shape that narrows it down to five thousand planets within travelling distance what else do we know about them information
37023,yep narrows it down
37024,narrows it down
37025,narrows it down
37026,narrows it down
37027,narrows it down
37028,calcium decay now that narrows it down
37029,calcium phosphate organic calcium living calcium creatures made out of living calcium what else what else hyphenated surname yes that narrows it down to one planet raxacoricofallapatorius
37030,calcium weakened by the compression field acetic acid vinegar
37031,just like hannibal mickey have you got any vinegar
37032,what
37033,hes making it up theres no weapons up there theres no threat he just invented it
37034,thats why the slitheen went for spectacle they want the whole world panicking because you lot you get scared you lash out
37035,and the slitheen go nuclear
37036,you get the codes release the missiles but not into space because theres nothing there you attack every other country on earth they retaliate fight back world war three whole planet gets nuked
37037,profit thats what the signal is beaming into space an advert
37038,at the cost of five billion lives
37039,i give you a choice leave this planet or ill stop you

37051,not solid enough built for short range attack nothing this big
37052,stop them intercepting it     doctor

37065,no chance hes a liability im not having him on board
37066,my decision is final
37067,dont know some kind of signal drawing the tardis off course
37068,earth utah north america about half a mile underground
37069,two thousand and twelve
37070,an alien museum someones got a hobby they must have spent a fortune on this chunks of meteorite moon dust thats the milometer from the roswell spaceship
37071,oh look at you
37072,an old friend of mine well enemy the stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit im getting old
37073,no its stone dead the signals alive somethings reaching out calling for help
37074,i really wouldnt hold it like that
37075,really though thats wrong
37076,no it just looks silly
37077,and its a long way from home
37078,i did say delicate it reacts to the smallest fingerprint it needs precision
37079,im the doctor and who are you
37080,pretty much sums me up yeah
37081,so youre just about an expert in everything except the things in your museum anything you dont understand you lock up
37082,i dont need to make claims i know how good i am
37083,you tell me
37084,and whats that
37085,show me
37086,inside inside what
37087,metaltron
37088,i wont touch it then
37089,look im sorry about this mister van statten might think hes clever but never mind him ive come to help im the doctor
37090,impossible
37091,let me out
37092,its not working
37093,what for whatre you going to do to me if you cant kill then what are you good for dalek whats the point of you youre nothing    doctor
37094,well youre never going to get any not ever
37095,theyre never going to come your race is dead you all burnt all of you ten million ships on fire the entire dalek race wiped out in one second
37096,i watched it happen i made it happen
37097,i had no choice
37098,dead they burnt with you the end of the last great time war everyone lost
37099,oh and i caught your little signal help me poor little thing but theres no one else coming cause theres no one else left
37100,yep
37101,were not the same im not  no wait maybe we are youre right yeah okay youve got a point cause i know what to do i know what should happen i know what you deserve exterminate
37102,why should i you never did          van statten
37103,the metals just battle armour the real dalek creatures inside
37104,a nightmare its a mutation the dalek race was genetically engineered every single emotion was removed except hate
37105,by a genius van statten by a man who was king of his own little world youd like him
37106,because im here how did it get to earth does anyone know
37107,it must have fallen through time the only survivor
37108,the time war the final battle between my people and the dalek race
37109,not by choice
37110,so thats your secret you dont just collect this stuff you scavenge it
37111,do you know what a dalek is van statten a dalek is honest it does what it was born to do for the survival of its species that creature in your dungeon is better than you
37112,listen to me that thing downstairs is going to kill every last one of us
37113,but its woken up it knows im here its going to get out van statten i swear no one on this base is safe no one on this planet
37114,release me if you want to live
37115,rose get out of there
37116,its downloading
37117,its not just energy that dalek just absorbed the entire internet it knows everything
37118,this museum of yours have you got any alien weapons
37119,leaving everyone trapped with it rose is down there i wont let that happen have you got that its got to go through this area whats that
37120,give guns to the technicians the lawyers anyone everyone only then have you got a chance of killing it
37121,whats the nearest town
37122,population
37123,all dead if the dalek gets out itll murder every living creature thats all it needs
37124,because it honestly believes they should die human beings are different and anything different is wrong its the ultimate in racial cleansing and you van statten youve let it loose the daleks surrounded by a force field the bullets are melting before they even hit home but its not indestructible    doctor
37125,it wants us to see
37126,you said we could seal the vault
37127,weve got emergency power we can reroute that to the bulkhead doors

37133,im sorry
37134,rose where are you rose did you make it
37135,i said id protect her she was only here because of me and youre sorry i couldve killed that dalek in its cell but you stopped me
37136,your collection but was it worth it worth all those mens deaths worth rose let me tell you something van statten mankind goes into space to explore to be part of something greater
37137,you just want to drag the stars down and stick them underground underneath tons of sand and dirt and label them youre about as far from the stars as you can get and you took her down with you she was nineteen years old
37138,you were quick on your feet leaving rose behind
37139,youre alive  rose

37489,it wasnt empty captain there was enough nanogenes in there to rebuild a species
37490,getting it now are we when the ship crashes the nanogenes escape billions upon billions of them ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world but what they find first is a dead child probably killed earlier that night and wearing a gasmask
37491,whats life lifes easy a quirk of matter natures way of keeping meat fresh nothing to a nanogene one problem though these nanogenes theyre not like the ones on your ship this lot have never seen a human being before dont know what a human beings supposed to look like all theyve got to go on is one little body and theres not a lot left but they carry right on they do what theyre programmed to do they patch it up cant tell whats gasmask and whats skull but they do their best then off they fly off they go work to be done because you see now they think they know what people should look like and its time to fix all the rest and they wont ever stop they wont ever ever stop the entire human race is going to be torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother and nothing in the world can stop it
37492,the ship thinks its under attack its calling up the troops standard protocol
37493,they are now this is a battlefield ambulance the nanogenes dont just fix you up they get you ready for the front line equip you programme you
37494,its a fully equipped chula warrior yes all that weapons tech in the hands of a hysterical four year old looking for his mummy and now theres an army of them
37495,good little soldiers waiting for their commander

37668,i wouldnt mind if you did not a bad idea lynda with a y but first of all weve got to concentrate on the getting out and to do that youve got to know your enemy whos controlling it whos in charge of the satellite now
37669,whats happened to it
37670,so the population just sits there half the worlds too fat and half the worlds too thin and you lot just watch telly
37671,the human race brainless sheep being fed on a diet of mind you have they still got that programme where three people have to live with a bear

37705,im here
37706,what do you want
37707,who are your masters
37708,my friend died inside your games
37709,dont you dare tell me that
37710,who are they
37711,who are they
37712,tell me who are they
37713,whens the next solar flare
37714,fat lot of good that is
37715,were not leaving now
37716,but you killed her
37717,dont the solar flares gone theyll hear you
37718,they took her
37719,theres a time and a place
37720,going way back installing the jagrafess a hundred years ago someones been playing a long game controlling the human race from behind the scenes for generations
37721,it looks like nothing because thats what this satellite does underneath the transmission theres another signal
37722,hiding whatevers out there hiding it from sonar radar scanner theres something sitting right on top of planet earth but its completely invisible if i cancel the signal
37723,obviously they survived
37724,two hundred ships more than two thousand on board each one thats just about half a million of them
37725,daleks
37726,oh will you thats nice hello  dalek
37727,yeah and doesnt that scare you to death rose     doctor
37728,and for my next trick
37729,i told you id come and get you
37730,i did you all right
37731,not bad been better
37732,they went off to fight a bigger war the time war
37733,i was there the war between the daleks and the time lords with the whole of creation at stake my people were destroyed but they took the daleks with them i almost thought it was worth it now it turns out they died for nothing
37734,no good stood round here chin wagging human race youd gossip all day the daleks have got the answers lets go and meet the neighbours
37735,is that it useless nul points its all right come on out that forcefield can hold back anything
37736,yes but i wasnt going to tell them that thanks
37737,do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the dalek homeworld the oncoming storm you mightve removed all your emotions but i reckon right down deep in your dna theres one little spark left and thats fear doesnt it just burn when you face me so tell me how did you survive the time war  emperor
37738,i get it
37739,i think youre forgetting something im the doctor and if theres one thing i can do its talk ive got five billion languages and you havent got one way of stopping me so if anybodys going to shut up its you okey doke so where were we
37740,so you created an army of daleks out of the dead
37741,since when did the daleks have a concept of blasphemy
37742,theyre insane hiding in silence for hundreds of years thats enough to drive anyone mad but its worse than that driven mad by your own flesh the stink of humanity you hate your own existence and that makes them more deadly than ever were going
37743,turn everything up all transmitters full power wide open now do it
37744,stops the daleks from transmatting on board how did you get on did you contact earth
37745,and the planets just sitting there defenceless lynda whatre you still doing on board i told you to evacuate everyone
37746,dalek plan big mistake because what have they left me with anyone anyone oh come on its obvious a great big transmitter this station if i can change the signal fold it back sequence it anyone
37747,give the man a medal
37748,a delta wave
37749,and this place can transmit a massive wave wipe out the daleks
37750,trouble is wave this size building this big brain as clever as mine should take about oh three days how long till the fleet arrive
37751,rose you can help me i need all these wires stripping bare
37752,me too
37753,what
37754,you said suppose
37755,as soon as the tardis lands in that second i become part of events stuck in the timeline
37756,theres another thing the tardis could do it could take us away we could leave let history take its course we go to marbella in 1989
37757,no but you could ask never even occurred to you did it
37758,the delta waves started building how long does it need
37759,rose tyler youre a genius we can do it if i use the tardis to cross my old timeline yes
37760,cancels the buffers if im very clever and im more than clever im brilliant i might just save the world or rip it apart
37761,me too now ive just got to go and power up the game station hold on
37762,and thats okay hope its a good death but i promised to look after you and thats what im doing the tardis is taking you home
37763,shes not here
37764,shes not coming back        jack
37765,jack
37766,youll be all right lynda that side of the stations reinforced against meteors
37767,its ready
37768,whatve you done
37769,you looked into the time vortex rose no ones meant to see that  emperor
37770,rose youve got to stop this youve got to stop this now youve got the entire vortex running through your head youre going to burn
37771,rose youve done it now stop just let go
37772,but this is wrong you cant control life and death
37773,the powers going to kill you and its my fault
37774,thats what i see all the time and doesnt it drive you mad
37775,come here
37776,i think you need a doctor
37777,thats right i sang a song and the daleks ran away
37778,rose tyler i was going take you to so many places barcelona not the city barcelona the planet barcelona youd love it fantastic place theyve got dogs with no noses imagine how many times a day you end up telling that joke and its still funny
37779,maybe you will and maybe i will but not like this
37780,i might never make sense again i might have two heads or no head imagine me with no head and dont say thats an improvement but its a bit dodgy this process you never know what youre going to end up with
37781,stay away
37782,i absorbed all the energy of the time vortex and no ones meant to do that every cell in my bodys dying
37783,yeah im doing it now time lords have this little trick its sort of a way of cheating death except it means im going to change and im not going to see you again not like this not with this daft old face and before i go
37784,rose before i go i just want to tell you you were fantastic absolutely fantastic and do you know what so was i

38067,the god maker the universal theory crack that equation and youve got control of the building blocks of the universe time and space and matter yours to control
38068,yes and their learning power is being accelerated by the oil that oil from the kitchens it works as a as a conducting agent makes the kids cleverer
38069,whats fifty nine times thirty five

38131,jeanneantoinette poisson known to her friends as reinette one of the most accomplished women who ever lived
38132,no hes already got a queen shes got plans of being his mistress
38133,i think this is the night they met the night of the yew tree ball in no time at flat shell get herself established as his official mistress with her own rooms at the palace even her own title madame de pompadour

38139,i dont know it did when you were a child lets see if youve still got it
38140,what happened to the ship then there was a lot of damage
38141,that ship hasnt moved in over a year whats taken you so long
38142,whats happened to the crew where are they
38143,there should have been over fifty people on your ship where did they go
38144,fifty people dont just disappear where oh you didnt have the parts so you used the crew
38145,it was just doing what it was programmed to repairing the ship any way it can with whatever it could find no one told it the crew werent on the menu what did you say the flight deck smelt of
38146,flesh plus heat barbeque but what are you doing here youve opened up time windows that takes colossal energy why come here you could have gone to your repair yard instead you come to eighteenth century france why
38147,then why havent you taken it
38148,what so thats the plan then just keep opening up more and more time windows scanning her brain checking to see if shes done yet
38149,reinette no
38150,good name for a horse
38151,i let you keep mickey now go go go
38152,oh dear reinette youve had some cowboys in here

38165,oh you sound just like your mother
38166,well among other things i think just invented the banana daiquiri a few centuries early do you know theyve never even seen a banana before always take a banana to a party rose bananas are good oh ho ho ho ho brilliant its you youre my favourite you are you are the best do you know why because youre so thick youre mister thick thick thickity thick face from thicktown thickania and sos your dad do you know what they were scanning reinettes brain for her milometer they want to know how old she is know why because this ship is thirty seven years old and they think that when reinette is thirty seven when shes complete then her brain will be compatible so thats what youre missing isnt it hmm command circuit your computer your ship needs a brain and for some reason god knows what only the brain of madame de pompadour will do
38167,compatible if you believe that you probably believe this is a glass of wine
38168,yeah safe safe and thick way i like them okay all the time windows are controlled from here i need to close them all down zeus plugs where are my zeus plugs i had them a minute ago i was using them as castanets
38169,with the amount of damage to these circuits they did well to hit the right century trial and error after that the windows arent closing why wont they close
38170,i dont know incoming message
38171,report from the field one of them must still be out there with reinette thats why i cant close the windows theres an override
38172,one of them must have found the right time window now its time to send in the troops and this time theyre bringing back her head
38173,they knew i was coming they blocked it off
38174,they teleported you saw them as long as the ship and the ballroom are linked their short range teleports will do the trick
38175,we cant use the tardis were part of events now
38176,hyperplex this side plate glass the other we need a truck
38177,i know we dont have a truck
38178,no smash the glass smash the time window thered be no way back  reinette
38179,madame de pompadour you look younger every day
38180,yeah well im the lord of time and im here to fix the clock
38181,the link with the ship is broken no way back you dont have the parts how many ticks left in that clockwork heart huh a day an hour its over accept that im not winding you up
38182,theyve stopped they have no purpose now
38183,whats in a name names are just titles titles dont tell you anything
38184,like madame de pompadour
38185,from time to time
38186,mmm pretty much
38187,yeah i did didnt i catch me doing that again
38188,when the mirror broke the shock would have severed all the links with the ship therell be a few more broken mirrors and torn tapestries around here im afraid wherever there was a time window ill ill pay for any damage er thats a thought im going to need money i was always a bit vague about money where do you get money
38189,yep the slow path heres to the slow path
38190,well im not going anywhere
38191,the fireplace the fireplace from your bedroom when did you do this
38192,you broke the bond with the ship when you moved it which means it was offline when the mirror broke thats what saved it but the link is basically physical and its still physically here which might just mean if im lucky if im very very very very very very lucky
38193,loose connection
38194,madame de pompadour still want to see those stars
38195,give me two minutes pack a bag
38196,go to the window pick a star any star
38197,great always wait five and a half hours
38198,explain later into the tardis be with you in a sec
38199,ah
38200,well probably never know there was massive damage in the computer memory banks it probably got confused the tardis can close down the time windows now the droids are gone should stop it causing any more trouble
38201,im always all right
38202,and that weird munchkin lady with the big eyes do you remember the way she looked at you and then she opens her mouth and fire comes out

38393,oh very good very good
38394,well for starters i know you cant wrap your hand around your elbow and make your fingers meet
38395,well the thing is detective inspector bishop
38396,its written inside your collar bless your mum but i cant help thinking detective inspector youre not exactly doing much detective inspecting are you
38397,all youre doing is grabbing those faceless people and hiding them as fast as you can dont tell me orders from above hmm coronation day the eyes of the world are on london town so any sort of problem just gets swept out of sight
38398,but doesnt it drive you mad doing nothing dont you want to get out there and investigate
38399,well that could change
38400,start from the beginning tell me everything you know
38401,is there any sort of pattern
38402,florizel street
38403,rose
38404,know her she
38405,they did what
38406,they left her where
38407,in the street they left her in the street they took her face and just chucked her out and left her in the street and as a result that makes things simple very very simple do you know why
38408,because now detective inspector bishop there is no power on this earth that can stop me come on
38409,tommy talk to me i need to know exactly what happened inside your house
38410,mister connolly

38419,no its just using her image
38420,so your own people tried to stop you
38421,and now youre trapped in the television
38422,yes tommy it feeds off the electrical activity of the brain but it gorges itself like a great overfed pig taking peoples faces their essences it stuffs itself
38423,for the first time in history millions gathered around a television set but youre not strong enough yet are you you cant do it all from here thats why you need this you need something more powerful this will turn a big transmitter into a big receiver
38424,tommy wake up tommy come on
38425,wheres magpie
38426,its never too late as a wise person once said kylie i think the wires got big plans itll need yes yes yes its got to harvest half the population millions and millions of people and where are we
38427,muswell hill muswell hill which means alexandra palace biggest tv transmitter in north london oh thats why it chose this place tommy
38428,were going shopping
38429,perfect right i need one more thing
38430,come on
38431,theyre saving me a seat

38434,been burning the candle at both ends youve overextended yourself missis you shouldnt have had a crack at poor old magpie there
38435,its close down im afraid and no epilogue
38436,sorted electrical creature tv technology clever alien life form thats me by the way i turned the receiver back into a transmitter and i trapped the wire in here
38437,nah thats just pomp and circumstance this is history right here
38438,exactly
38439,hope so just to be on the safe side though ill use my unrivalled knowledge of transtemporal extirpation methods to neutralise the residual electronic pattern
38440,im going to tape over it
38441,tell you what tommy you can have the scooter little present best er keep it in the garage for a few years though eh
38442,is that it then tommy new monarch new age new world no room for a man like eddie connelly
38443,i think weve landed inside a cupboard here we go
38444,human design youve got a thing about kits this place was put together like a flat pack wardrobe only bigger and easier
38445,oh its a sanctuary base
38446,deep space exploration weve gone way out and listen to that underneath someones drilling
38447,oh its not that bad
38448,hold on what does that say thats weird it wont translate
38449,exactly if thats not working then it means this writing is old very old impossibly old we should find out whos in charge
38450,oh right hello sorry i was just saying er nice base
38451,youve got to what
38452,sorry
38453,er
38454,no idea more fun that way    scooti
38455,thats us hooray
38456,whats this planet called anyway
38457,oh well that wasnt so bad
38458,were fine thanks fine yeah dont worry about us
38459,but thats impossible
38460,were standing under a black hole
38461,but we cant be
38462,but we cant be
38463,bad doesnt cover it a black holes a dead star it collapses in on itself in and in and in until the matters so dense and tight it starts to pull everything else in too nothing in the universe can escape it light gravity time everything just gets pulled inside and crushed
38464,we should be dead
38465,we are so far out lost in the drifts of the universe how did you even get here
38466,but that field would take phenomenal amounts of power i mean not just big but off the scale can i
38467,there we go do you see to generate that gravity field and the funnel youd need a power source with an inverted self extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds
38468,and its impossible
38469,im very good
38470,or start a war
38471,i saw that lettering written on the wall did you do that
38472,no neither can i and thats saying something
38473,and you came
38474,so when it comes right down to it why did you come here why did you do that why ill tell you why because it was there brilliant excuse me er zach wasnt it
38475,just stand there because im going to hug you is that all right
38476,here we go come on then

38478,oh ive got this er this ship its hard to explain it just sort of appears
38479,three
38480,it was a bit of a cupboard yeah storage six but you said you said you said storage five to eight
38481,it cant be it cant be
38482,the tardis is gone
38483,the earthquake this section collapsed
38484,look down
38485,but i need my ship its all ive got literally the only thing
38486,ive trapped you here
38487,er no could you leave it open just for a bit i wont go mad i promise
38488,not that one it just eats
38489,go that way turn right keep going for er about er five hundred years and youll reach the earth
38490,they were grown not built and with my own planet gone were kind of stuck
38491,and then what
38492,id have to settle down get a house or something a proper house with with doors and things carpets me living in a house now that that is terrifying
38493,no
38494,im dying thats it im dying it is all over
38495,anyway
38496,i promised jackie id always take you back home
38497,not to end up stuck here
38498,yeah
38499,yeah sorry straight to business the ood how do they communicate i mean with each other
38500,this telepathic field can it pick up messages
38501,monitor the field thats this thing
38502,well thats not basic five ten twenty theyve gone up to basic thirty
38503,or somethings shouting at them
38504,he is awake
38505,worship who  whos talking to you who is it
38506,everyone all right what happened what was it
38507,that wasnt a quake what caused it
38508,what happened
38509,oh youve gone native
38510,ive found her
38511,im sorry im so sorry
38512,the drill
38513,reporting as a volunteer for the expeditionary force
38514,yeah but you trust me dont you and you cant let ida go down there on her own go on look me in the eye yes you do i can see it trust
38515,the captain doesnt lead the mission he stays here in charge
38516,oxygen nitro balance gravity its ages since i wore one of these
38517,yes sir
38518,ill see you later
38519,its all right weve made it getting out of the capsule now  rose
38520,rose you can tell toby weve found his civilisation
38521,oh did you have to no turning back thats almost as bad as nothing can possible go wrong or this is going to be the best christmas walfords ever had
38522,yeah finished
38523,thats what trapdoors tend to do
38524,i suppose thats the writing itll tell us what to do the letters that defy translation
38525,what is it whats he done whats happening rose whats going on
38526,whoa careful anyway its both of us me and ida hello but the seal opened up its gone all weve got left is this chasm  zach
38527,no no no sign of the beast
38528,i think theyve an order
38529,it said i am the temptation
38530,maybe we opened the prison but not the cell
38531,oh oh in a second but then again that is so human where angels fear to tread even now standing on the edge its that feeling you get eh right at the back of your head that impulse that strange little impulse that mad little voice saying go on go on go on go over go on maybe its relying on that for once in my life officer scott im going to say retreat oh now i know im getting old rose were coming back
38532,whats strategy nine
38533,so were going back to a slaughter
38534,if you are the beast then answer me this which one hmm cos the universe has been busy since youve been gone theres more religions than there are planets in the sky the archiphets orkology christianity pash pash new judaism san klah church of the tin vagabond which devil are you  voice
38535,then listen to mine that thing is playing on very basic fears darkness childhood nightmares all that stuff
38536,okay but what makes his version of the truth any better than mine hmm cos ill tell you what i can see humans    doctor
38537,get out
38538,how much air have we got
38539,and then what
38540,abseil right
38541,ill get back rose is up there
38542,well its half of a good plan
38543,i go down not you
38544,fine should work doesnt feel like such a good idea now
38545,no thats not it thats too kind its not the urge to jump its deeper than that its the urge to fall
38546,not bad thanks the wall of the pit seems to be the same as the cavern just not much of it theres a crust about twenty feet down and then nothing just the pit okay then lower me down
38547,you get representations of the horned beast right across the universe in the myths and legends of a million worlds earth draconia velconsadine daemos the kaled god of war its the same image over and over again maybe that idea came from somewhere bleeding through the thought at the back of every sentient mind
38548,could be
38549,well if thats what you want to believe maybe thats what the devil is in the end an idea
38550,nothing could be miles to go yet or could be thirty feet no way of telling i could survive thirty feet
38551,you bring me back then were just going to sit there and run out of air ive got to go down
38552,call it an act of faith
38553,i know
38554,i didnt ask have you got any sort of faith
38555,neo classics have they got a devil
38556,same thing in the end
38557,i believe i believe i havent seen everything i dont know its funny isnt it the things you make up the rules if that thing had said it came from beyond the universe id believe it but before the universe impossible doesnt fit my rule still thats why i keep travelling to be proved wrong thank you ida
38558,if they get back in touch if you talk to rose just tell her tell her oh she knows    rose
38559,im breathing air cushion to support the fall you can breath down here ida can you hear me ida
38560,a rocket
38561,the history of some big battle man against beast i dont know if youre getting this ida hope so anyway they defeated the beast and imprisoned it
38562,i accept that you exist i dont have to accept what you are but youre physical existence ill give you that i dont understand i was expected down here i was given a safe landing and air you need me for something what for have i got to i dont know beg an audience or is there a ritual some sort of incantation or summons or spell all these things i dont believe in are they real speak to me tell me you wont talk or you cant talk oh hold on wait a minute just let me oh no yes no think it through you spoke before i heard your voice an intelligent voice no more than that brilliant but looking at you now all i can see is beast the animal just the body youre just the body the physical form whats happened to your mind hmm wheres it gone wheres that intelligence oh no
38563,youre imprisoned long time ago before the universe after sideways in between doesnt matter the prison is perfect its absolute its eternal oh yes open the prison the gravity field collapses this planet falls into the black hole you escape you die brilliant but thats just the body the body is trapped thats all the devil is an idea in all those civilisations just an idea but an idea is hard to kill an idea could escape the mind the mind of the great beast the mind can escape oh but thats it you didnt give me air your jailers did they set this up all those years ago they need me alive because if youre escaping then ive got to stop you if i destroy your prison your body is destroyed your mind with it
38564,so thats the trap or the test or the final judgment i dont know but if i kill you i kill her except that implies in this big grand scheme of gods and devils that shes just a victim but ive seen a lot of this universe ive seen fake gods and bad gods and demigods and wouldbe gods and out of all that out of that whole pantheon if i believe in one thing just one thing i believe in her
38565,this is your freedom free to die youre going into that black hole and im riding with you
38566,well in fact they did in a couple of minutes well be nice and safe oh and captain
38567,yeah bit of oxygen starvation but she should be all right i couldnt save the ood i only had time for one trip
38568,and the next time you get curious about something oh whats the point youll just go blundering in the human race
38569,i dont know never did decipher that writing but thats good day i know everything might as well stop
38570,i think we beat it thats good enough for me
38571,then it lied right onwards upwards ida see you again maybe
38572,here boy eat the food come on look at the lovely food isnt that nice isnt it yes it is get out of here quickly thats a boy wouldnt you like a porkychoppy then i said run
38573,i said not blue
38574,someone wants a word with you
38575,interesting a sort absorbatrix absorbaclon absorbaloff
38576,not from raxacoricofallapatorius are you
38577,really whats the twin planet of raxacoricofallapatorius
38578,clom
38579,well thats never going to happen
38580,sweet maybe passionate i suppose but dont ever mistake that for nice do what you want
38581,go on then
38582,mind you the others might have something to say
38583,the cane created a limitation field now its broken he cant stop the absorber is being absorbed
38584,by the earth
38585,you dont remember do you  elton
38586,if i can key into the absorption matrix and separate the last victim its too late for total reconstruction but elton fetch a spade
38587,ah
38588,i had a passing fancy only it didnt pass it stopped
38589,only seems like yesterday a few naked greek blokes were tossing a discus about wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood around baying no wait a minute that was club med just in time for the opening doo dah ceremony tonight i thought youd like that last one they had in london was dynamite wembley 1948 i loved it so much i went back and watched it all over again fella carrying the torch lovely chap what was his
38590,and in those days everybody had a tea party to go to
38591,did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy ball bearings on top
38592,do you know those things nobody else in this entire galaxys ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings genius
38593,what makes you think its a person
38594,ooo tickles
38595,my er snakes and ladders quite good at squash reasonable im being facetious arent i theres no call for it
38596,im im a police officer thats what i am ive got a badge and a police car you dont have to get i can i can prove it just hold on
38597,see look ive got a colleague lewis
38598,training new recruit it was either that or hairdressing so voila
38599,why dont we
38600,im of the opinion that all weve got to do is just
38601,i think we need to just
38602,fingers on lips
38603,can you smell it what does it remind you of
38604,mmm hmm
38605,danny edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other whoa there it goes again look at the hairs on the back of my manly hairy hand
38606,theres a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished whatever it was it used an awful lot of power to do this
38607,thanks im experimenting with back combing oh
38608,no im not really a cat person once youve been threatened by one in a nuns wimple it kind of takes the joy out of it
38609,whoa hoo hoo hoo hoo ion residue blimey that takes some doing just to snatch a living organism out of spacetime this baby is just like im having some of that im impressed
38610,it can harness huge reserves of ionic power we need to find the source of that power find the source and you will find whatever has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals see what you can see keep them peeled lewis
38611,stay still
38612,no probs ill give you a fiver if you can tell me what the hell it is because i havent got the foggiest
38613,it was never living its animated by energy same energy thats snatching people that is so dinky the go anywhere creature fits in your pocket makes friends impresses the boss breaks the ice at parties
38614,it is its graphite basically the same material as an hb pencil
38615,scribble creature brought into being with ionic energy whatever were dealing with it can create things as well as take them but why make a scribble creature
38616,probably
38617,of course what girl
38618,are you deducting
38619,coppers hunch
38620,hello im the doctor and this is rose can we see your daughter
38621,okay bye
38622,well theres some interesting stuff going on in this street and i just thought well we thought that she might like to give us a hand
38623,yeah sorry well let you get on with things on your own bye again
38624,yes i can     huw edwards
38625,well lets go and say hi
38626,why are you afraid of her trish
38627,im sure she is
38628,all right there im the doctor
38629,howre you doing chloe webber
38630,but youve been drawing though im rubbish stick men about my limit can do this though
38631,who dont
38632,come on chloe dont be a spoil sport whats the big project im dying to know whatre you making up there  rose
38633,no ta
38634,tell us about the drawings chloe
38635,yes you have out of the corner of your eye
38636,and you dismissed it because what choice do you have when you see something you cant possibly explain you dismiss it right and if anyone mentions it you get angry so its never spoken of ever again
38637,youre terrified of her but theres nowhere to turn to because whos going to believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye no one except me
38638,im help
38639,ionic energy chloes harnessing it to steal those kids and place them in some kid of holding pen made up of ionic power
38640,if living things can become drawings then maybe drawings can become living things chloes real dad is dead but not the one who visits her in her nightmares that dad seems very real thats the dad shes drawn and hes a heartbeat away from crashing into this world
38641,lets find out
38642,now we can talk
38643,who are you
38644,im speaking to you the entity that is using this human child i request parley in compliance with the shadow proclamation
38645,so what do you care about
38646,youre lonely i know identify yourself
38647,name yourself
38648,youre isolus of course
38649,the isolus mother drifting in deep space see she jettisons millions of fledgling spores her children the isolus are empathic beings of intense emotions but when theyre cast off from their mother their empathic link their need for each other is what sustains them they need to be together they cannot be alone
38650,the isolus children travel each inside a pod they ride the heat and energy of solar tides it takes thousands and thousands of years for them to grow up
38651,while they travel they play games they use their ionic power to literally create make believe worlds in which to play
38652,helps keep them happy while theyre happy they can feed off each others love without it theyre lost why did you come to earth
38653,thats a solar flare from your sun would have made a tidal wave of solar energy that scattered the isolus pods
38654,your pod crashed where is it
38655,you empathised with her you wanted to be with her because she was alone like you
38656,i understand you want to make a family but you cant stay in this child its wrong you cant steal any more friends for yourself
38657,trish how do you calm her
38658,when she has nightmares what do you do
38659,then start singing  chloes dad
38660,her and the isolus two lonely kids who need each other
38661,its desperate to be loved its used to a pretty big family
38662,say around four billion     huw edwards
38663,well its been sucking in all the heat it can hopefully that should keep it in a fit state to launch it must be close it should have a weak energy signature that the tardis can trace once we find it then we can stop the isolus
38664,we can scan for the same trace that i picked up from the scribble creature wed need to widen the field a bit

38727,yeah
38728,this is a void ship
38729,well its impossible for starters i always thought it was just a theory but its a vessel designed to exist outside time and space travelling through the void
38730,the space between dimensions theres all sorts of realities around us different dimensions billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other the void is the space in between containing absolutely nothing imagine that nothing no light no dark no up no down no life no time without end my people called it the void the eternals call it the howling but some people call it hell
38731,to explore to escape you could sit inside that thing and eternity would pass you by the big bang end of the universe start of the next wouldnt even touch the sides youd exist outside the whole of creation
38732,oh yes
38733,we dont we send that thing back into hell how did it get here in the first place
38734,show me
38735,how did you even find it
38736,you built a skyscraper just to reach a spatial disturbance how much money have you got
38737,so you find the breach probe it the sphere comes through six hundred feet above london bam it leaves a hole in the fabric of reality and that hole you think oh shall we leave it alone shall we back off shall we play it safe nah you think lets make it bigger

38793,whos the president now
38794,oof id keep an eye on her
38795,no
38796,ive been trying to tell you travel between parallel worlds is impossible then the daleks break down the walls with a sphere
38797,then the cybermen travelled across then you lot those discs every time you jump from one reality to another you rip a hole in the universe this planet is starting to boil keep going and both worlds will fall into the void
38798,leaving five million cybermen stranded on my earth
38799,hmm pete tyler i knew you when you were dead now here you are fighting the fight alone there is a chance back on my world jackie tyler might still be alive
38800,her husband died good match

38812,the last four daleks in existence so whats so special about you
38813,so thats it at last the cult of skaro i thought you were just a legend
38814,a secret order above and beyond the emperor himself their job was to imagine think as the enemy thinks even dared to have names all to find new ways of killing
38815,i dont know never seen it before
38816,both sides had secrets what is it what have you done
38817,what does that mean what sort of time lord science what do you mean
38818,technology using the one thing a dalek cant do touch sealed inside your casing not feeling anything ever from birth to death locked inside a cold metal cage completely alone that explains your voice no wonder you scream
38819,the doctor will not
38820,well you got me there although there is always this
38821,thats screwdriver
38822,oh yes harmless is just the word thats why i like it doesnt kill doesnt wound doesnt maim but ill tell you what it does do it is very good at opening doors

38825,mickey without us theyd have opened it by force to do that theyd have blown up the sun youve done us a favour now run
38826,its pete from a different universe there are parallel worlds jackie every single decision we make creates a parallel existence a different dimension where
38827,time lord science what time lord science what is it
38828,time lord science its bigger on the inside
38829,its a prison ship
38830,millions
38831,oh im ready ive got the equipment right here thank you torchwood
38832,theyre part of the problem and that makes them part of the solution oh yes well isnt anyone going to ask what is it with the glasses
38833,i can see thats what because weve got two separate worlds but in between the two separate worlds weve got the void thats where the daleks were hiding and the cybermen travelled through the void to get here and you lot one world to another via the void oh i like that via the void look
38834,void stuff
38835,thats it look at the others and the only one who hasnt been through the void your mother first time shes looked normal all in her life
38836,but the daleks lived inside the void theyre bristling with it cybermen all of them i just open the void and reverse the void stuff gets sucked back inside
38837,pulling them all in
38838,the dead space some people call it hell
38839,thats why youve got to go
38840,back to petes world hey we should call it that petes world im opening the void but only on this side youll be safe on that side
38841,the breach itself is soaked in void stuff in the end itll close itself and thats it kaput
38842,thats why i got these  ill just have to hold on tight ive been doing it all my life
38843,yeah
38844,yeah
38845,once the breach collapses thats it you will never be able to see her again your own mother

39043,the carrionites disappeared way back at the dawn of the universe nobody was sure if they were real or legend
39044,a new empire on earth a world of bones and blood and witchcraft
39045,im looking at the man with the words
39046,what happens on the last page
39047,thats it they used you they gave you the final words like a spell like a code loves labours won its a weapon the right combination of words spoken at the right place with the shape of the globe as an energy converter the plays the thing  and yes you can have that
39048,all hallows street there it is martha well track them down will you get to the globe whatever you do stop that play
39049,good luck shakespeare once more unto the breach
39050,oh just shift
39051,oh how to explain the mechanics of the infinite temporal flux i know back to the future its like back to the future
39052,no the novelisation yes the film marty mcfly goes back and changes history
39053,you and the entire future of the human race it ends right now in 1599 if we dont stop it but which house
39054,what have you done
39055,the naming wont work on me
39056,oh big mistake because that name keeps me fighting the carrionites vanished where did you go

39058,shakespeare
39059,how many of you
39060,hmm busy schedule but first youve got to get past me

39062,what did you do
39063,well give it back
39064,now you might call that magic id call that a dna replication module
39065,youre making a habit of this ah ive only got one heart working how do you people cope ive got to get the other one started hit me hit me on the chest dah other side now on the back on the back left a bit dah lovely there we go badda booma well what are you standing there for come one the globe

39068,yeah dont rub it youll go bald i think thats my cue
39069,come on will history needs you
39070,reverse it
39071,the shape of the globe gives words power but youre the wordsmith the one true genius the only man clever enough to do it
39072,youre william shakespeare
39073,trust yourself when youre locked away in your room the words just come dont they like magic words of the right sound the right shape the right rhythm words that last forever thats what you do will you choose perfect words do it improvise
39074,seven six one three nine oh

39196,it really doesnt matter
39197,i lied to you because i liked it i could pretend just for a bit i could imagine they were still alive underneath a burnt orange sky im not just a time lord im the last of the time lords the face of boe was wrong theres no one else
39198,there was a war a time war the last great time war my people fought a race called the daleks for the sake of all creation and they lost they lost everyone lost theyre all gone now my family my friends even that sky oh you should have seen it that old planet the second sun would rise in the south and the mountains would shine the leaves on the trees were silver and when they caught the light every morning it looked like a forest on fire when the autumn came the breeze would blow through the branches like a song
39199,ah smell that atlantic breeze nice and cold lovely martha have you met my friend
39200,gateway to the new world give me you tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breath free
39201,well theres the genuine article so good they named it twice mind you it was new amsterdam originally harder to say twice now wonder it didnt catch on new amsterdam new amsterdam
39202,work in progress still got a couple floors to go and if i know my history that makes the date somewhere around
39203,youre getting good at this
39204,i think our detour just got longer
39205,herbert hoover thirty first president of the usa came to power a year ago up till then new york was a boom town the roaring twenties and then
39206,yeah whole economy wiped out overnight thousands of people unemployed all of a sudden the huddled masses doubled in number with nowhere to go so they ended up here in central park
39207,ordinary people lost their jobs couldnt pay the rent and they lost everything there are places like this all over america no ones helping them you only come to hooverville when theres nowhere else to go
39208,come on  i suppose that makes you the boss around here
39209,but what does missing mean men must come and go here all the time its not like anyones keeping a register
39210,and youre sure someones taking them
39211,so the question is whos taking them and what for  frank
39212,what do you mean what sort of accidents
39213,oh no no no im volunteering ill go
39214,and if we dont come back up
39215,so this diagoras bloke who is he then
39216,howd he manage that then
39217,whoa
39218,shine your torch through it composite organic matter martha medical opinion
39219,no its not and ill tell you something else we must be at least half a mile in i dont see any sign of a collapse do you so why did mister diagoras send up down here
39220,well were right underneath manhattan
39221,looks like it
39222,solomon i think its time you took these two back ill be much quicker on my own
39223,do you think theyre still alive
39224,this way
39225,its all right frank just stay back let me have a look hes got a point though my mate frank id hate to be stuck down here on my own we know the way out daylight if you come with us
39226,no its real im sorry now listen to me i promise i can help who did this to you
39227,actually good point

39236,tallulah
39237,right we can try to find laszlo but hes not the only one there are people disappearing every night
39238,look listen just trust me everyone is in danger i need to find out exactly what this is
39239,perfect its the capacitors i need im just rigging up a crude little dna scan for this beastie if i can get a chromosomal reading i can find out where its from
39240,oh im just sort of passing by
39241,no sorry
39242,good luck
39243,thats it we need to heat you up
39244,genetically engineered whoever this is oh youre clever  mc
39245,fundamental dna type four six seven dash nine eight nine nine eight nine hold on that means planet of origin skaro
39246,where is she wheres martha
39247,martha
39248,theyve taken her
39249,theres nothing you can do go back
39250,tallulah youre not safe down here
39251,this way
39252,shush
39253,shush shush shush shush shush shush shush
39254,no no no no no no no they survived they always survive while i lose everything
39255,its called a dalek and its not just metal its alive
39256,does it look like im kidding inside that shell is a creature born to hate whose only thought is to destroy everything and everyone that isnt a dalek too it wont stop until its killed every human being alive
39257,every second youre down here youre in danger im taking you back right now
39258,can you remember your name
39259,what happened to you
39260,who did
39261,the daleks why
39262,do you know what happened to martha
39263,laszlo can you show me where they are
39264,if i dont stop them theyll kill everyone
39265,shush
39266,and the others
39267,why what for
39268,look out theyre moving
39269,im not coming ive got an idea you go
39270,just keep walking
39271,yeah well you can kiss me later you too frank if you want        dalek 1
39272,evolution
39273,ask them
39274,i dont exactly want to get noticed ask them whats going on
39275,ah well now that would be me
39276,well then a new form of dalek fascinating and very clever
39277,how did you end up in 1930
39278,oh that must have roasted up your power cells huh time was four daleks could have conquered the world but instead youre skulking away hidden in the dark experimenting all of which results in you
39279,what does it feel like you can talk to me dalek sec it is dalek sec isnt it thats your name youve got a name and a mind of your own tell me what youre thinking right now
39280,good thats good
39281,no thats not what humanity means
39282,all right so what have you achieved then with this final experiment eh nothing because i can show you what youre missing with this thing a simple little radio  dalek 3
39283,and you tallulah run
39284,come on everyone up come on    dalek 1
39285,theyre splicing themselves onto human bodies and if im right theyve got a farm of breeding stock right here in hooverville youve got to get everyone out
39286,im sorry solomon youve got to scatter go anywhere down to the railroads travel across state just get out of new york
39287,daleks are bad enough at anytime but right now theyre vulnerable that makes them more dangerous than ever
39288,its started
39289,we cant theyre on all sides theyre driving everyone back towards us
39290,oh martha theyre just the foot soldiers
39291,thats not going to work
39292,no solomon stay back
39293,solomon dont
39294,daleks all right so its my turn then kill me kill me if itll stop you attacking these people  dalek 3
39295,ive got to go the daleks just changed their minds daleks never change their minds
39296,one condition if i come with you you spare the lives of everyone here do you hear me
39297,martha stay here do what you do best people are hurt you can help them let me go oh and can i just say thank you very much
39298,those people were defenceless you only wanted me but no that wasnt enough for you you had to start killing because thats the only thing a daleks good for
39299,im sorry
39300,and thats good
39301,is it me or are you just becoming a little bit more human
39302,what do you want me for
39303,yeah i found one of your experiments just left to die out there in the dark
39304,is he dead
39305,dalek ideas
39306,all of these people how many
39307,is there any way to restore them make them human again
39308,so theyre like shells youve got empty human beings ready to be converted thats going to take a hell of a lot of power this planet hasnt even split the atom yet howre you going to do it
39309,yeah yeah yeah the empire state building were right underneath that i worked that out already thanks but what youve hijacked the whole building
39310,what for
39311,gamma radiation what are you oh the sun youre using the sun
39312,the army wakes i still dont know what you need me for
39313,removing the emotions makes you stronger thats what your creator thought all those years ago
39314,he was what
39315,but you wouldnt be the supreme beings anymore
39316,so you want to change everything that makes a dalek a dalek
39317,but youre the template i thought they were getting a dose of you
39318,to make them even more human
39319,hold on a minute theres no way this lot are going to let you do it
39320,oh and thats enough for you is it  dalek 2
39321,theres no room on earth for another race of people
39322,whens that solar flare
39323,right then better get to work
39324,theres no point in chromosomal grafting its too erratic you need to split the genome and force the dalek human sequence right into the cortex
39325,these pig slaves what happens to them in the grand plan
39326,laszlo i cant undo what theyve done to you but they wont do it to anyone else
39327,i know that one man can change the course of history right idea in the right place at the right time its all it takes ive got to believe its possible
39328,then its all systems go
39329,well be ready for it
39330,there goes the gene solution
39331,whats that
39332,no no no the gene feed theyre overriding the gene feed
39333,what have you done with the gene feed  dalek 1
39334,after you    dalek 1
39335,first floor perfumery
39336,oh come here
39337,right down to the daleks and theyre not going to leave us alone up here whats the time
39338,six minutes to go ive got to remove the dalekanium before the gamma radiation hits
39339,oh thats high thats very blimey thats high
39340,thats not we thats just me
39341,no youre going to have your hands full anyway im sorry martha but youve got to fight     dalek 3
39342,oh my head
39343,hi you survived then
39344,the daleks will have gone straight to a war footing theyll be using the sewers spreading the soldiers out underneath manhattan
39345,theres only one chance i got in the way that gamma strike went zapping though me first
39346,we need to draw fire before they can attack new york i need to face them where can i draw them out think think think think think we need some sort of space somewhere safe somewhere out of the way tallulah
39347,the theatre its right above them and what its gone midnight can you get us inside
39348,is there another lift
39349,thatll do allonsy      dalek 3
39350,not now tallulah sorry
39351,if the daleks are going to war theyll want to find their number one enemy im just telling them where i am       dalek 3
39352,martha thats an order
39353,its all right its all right just stay calm dont antagonize them
39354,oh and what a world with anything just the slightest bit different ground into the dirt thats dalek sec dont you remember the cleverest dalek ever and look what youve done to him is that your new empire hmm is that the foundation for a whole new civilization
39355,your own leader the only creature who might have led you out of the darkness and you destroyed him do you see what they did huh you see what a dalek really is    dalek 1
39356,no youre not and you never will be sorry i got in the way of the lightning strike time lord dna got all mixed up just that little bit of freedom  dalek 3
39357,its all right its all right its all right you did it youre free    dalek 1
39358,they killed them rather than let them live an entire species genocide
39359,oh yes in the whole universe just one
39360,yeah yeah yeah yeah just think about it dalek what was your name
39361,dalek caan your entire species has been wiped out and now the cult of skaro has been eradicated leaving only you right now youre facing the only man in the universe who might show you some compassion because ive just seen one genocide i wont cause another caan let me help you what do you say
39362,oh tallulah with three ls and an h just you watch me what do i need oh i dont know how about a great big genetic laboratory oh look ive got one laszlo just you hold on theres been too many deaths today
39363,what did they say
39364,i dont know anywhere else in the universe i might worry about them but new york thats what this citys good at give me your tired your poor your huddled masses and maybe the odd pig slave dalek mutant hybrid too
39365,the pig and the showgirl
39366,maybe
39367,what for
39368,oh yes one day  ltback to the episode listing
39369,the end of the line no place like it
39370,in fact the morning after we left so youve only been gone about twelve hours no time at all really
39371,yep all in one night relatively speaking everything should be just as it was books cds laundry so back were you were as promised
39372,yeah i should probably er    martha
39373,yes yes we should one trip is what we said
39374,mmm seems to happen to me a lot
39375,it was my pleasure
39376,oh black tie whenever i wear this something bad always happens
39377,james bond really
39378,hello
39379,so this lazarus hes your boss
39380,so do you know what the professors going to be doing tonight that looks like it might be a sonic microfield manipulator
39381,science geek what does that mean
39382,oh nice
39383,its lovely to meet you mrs jones heard a lot about you
39384,oh you know that youre marthas mother and er no actually thats about it we havent had much time to chat you know been busy
39385,oh you know stuff
39386,somethings wrong its overloading
39387,if this thing goes up itll take the whole building with it is that what you want
39388,oh its not a trick i wish it were
39389,he just changed what it means to be human
39390,energy deficit always happens with this kind of process
39391,doctor and well no not every day but i have some experience of this kind of transformation
39392,using hypersonic sound waves to create a state of resonance thats inspired
39393,enough to know that you couldnt possibly have allowed for all the variables
39394,that thing nearly exploded you might as well have stepped into a blender
39395,if i hadnt stopped it it would have exploded
39396,this isnt about improving this is about you and your customers living a little longer
39397,oh hes out of his depth no idea of the damage he might have done
39398,now well this building must be full of laboratories i say we do our own tests
39399,oh martha jones youre a star
39400,amazing
39401,lazaruss dna
39402,look at it
39403,but it did
39404,and thats two impossible things weve seen so far tonight dont you love it when that happens
39405,hypersonic sound waves to destabilise the cell structure then a metagenic programme to manipulate the coding in the protein strands basically he hacked into his own genes and instructed them to rejuvenate
39406,because he missed something something in his dna has been activated and wont let him stabilise something thats trying to change him
39407,i dont know but i think we need to find out
39408,lets go
39409,so where is he
39410,used to be now its just a shell had all the life energy drained out like squeezing the juice out of an orange
39411,could be
39412,not necessarily you saw the dna it was fluctuating the process must demand energy this might not have been enough
39413,mmm
39414,he cant be far keep looking
39415,where did they go
39416,fluctuating dna will give off an energy signature i might be able to pick it up
39417,falls the shadow
39418,i wouldnt have thought you had time for poetry lazarus what with you being busy defying the laws of nature and all
39419,doesnt work like that some people live more in twenty years than others do in eighty its not the time that matters its the person
39420,or what a curse look at what youve done to yourself
39421,run
39422,he must be breaking through that door the stairs come on
39423,we havent got much time
39424,martha setting fifty four hurry
39425,no get away from her
39426,lazarus leave them alone
39427,whats the point you cant control it the mutations too strong killing those people wont help you youre a fool a vain old man who thought he could defy nature only nature got her own back didnt she youre a joke lazarus a footnote in the history of failure
39428,is that the same arrogance you had when you swore nothing had gone wrong with your device
39429,you call feeding on innocent people progress youre delusional
39430,thats not your decision to make
39431,oh hello
39432,have you looked in the mirror lately why would i want to face that hmm
39433,how did you
39434,i blasted lazarus
39435,more sort of annoyed him id say
39436,we cant lead him outside come on get in
39437,well yeah thats a slight problem
39438,yes the plan was to get inside here
39439,well then id come up with another plan
39440,sorry sorry sorry
39441,improvise
39442,no for once its strictly human in origin
39443,probably from dormant genes in lazaruss dna the energy field in this thing must have reactivated them and it looks like theyre becoming dominant
39444,some option that evolution rejected for you millions of years ago but the potential is still there locked away in your genes forgotten about until lazarus unlocked it by mistake
39445,exactly nice shoes by the way
39446,sounds like hes switched the machine on
39447,well i was hoping it was going to take him a little bit longer to work that out
39448,i know i know nearly done
39449,im trying to set the capsule to reflect energy rather than receive it
39450,when he transforms hes three times his size cellular triplication so hes spreading himself thin
39451,just one more
39452,really shouldnt take that long just to reverse the polarity i must be a bit out of practice
39453,eliot saw that too this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a whimper
39454,ah mrs jones we still havent finished our chat
39455,all of the mothers every time
39456,lazarus back from the dead should have known really
39457,that way the church
39458,where would you go if you were looking for sanctuary
39459,the blitz
39460,i was there
39461,so are you
39462,thats what you were trying to do today
39463,what about the other people who died
39464,any of them might have done too you think historys only made with equations facing death is part of being human you cant change that
39465,look at yourself youre mutating youve no control over it you call that a success
39466,theres no such thing as an ordinary human
39467,i know if i can get him up into the bell tower somehow ive an idea that might work
39468,im old enough to know that a longer life isnt always a better one in the end you just get tired tired of the struggle tired of losing everyone that matters to you tired of watching everything turn to dust if you live long enough lazarus the only certainty left is that youll end up alone
39469,is it
39470,im not going to let that happen
39471,martha no
39472,where are they martha
39473,take him to the top the very top of the bell tower do you hear me

39511,oh youre good anyone else presenting these symptoms
39512,well thats something  mc

39527,concentrate on those doors youve got to keep moving
39528,endothermic vaporisation ive never seen one this ferocious burn with me
39529,his bioscan results internal temperature one hundred degrees body oxygen replaced by hydrogen your husband hasnt been infected hes been overwhelmed  mc
39530,but what is it though a parasite a mutagenic virus something that needs a host body but how did it get inside him  mc
39531,wheres the ship been have you made planetfall recently docked with any other vessels any kind of external contact at all  mc
39532,weve got to stop him before he kills again  mc
39533,i dont know  mc
39534,the parasites too aggressive your husbands gone theres no way back im sorry  mc

39714,i think hes asleep waiting to awaken
39715,oh low level telepathic field you were born with it just an extra synaptic engram causing is that how he talks
39716,you knew this all along and yet you watched while nurse redfern and
39717,falling in love that didnt even occur to him
39718,then what sort of man is that and now you expect me to die
39719,so your job was to execute me
39720,i should have thought of it before i can give them this just the watch then they can leave and i can stay as i am
39721,if they want the doctor they can have him
39722,if they get what they want then then
39723,he wont love you

39728,just
39729,please
39730,now i cant i cant pretend to understand not for a second but i want you to know im innocent in all this he made me john smith its not like i had any control over it
39731,i dont care about this doctor and your family i just want you to go so ive made my choice you can have him just take it please take him away
39732,wheres it gone
39733,oh i think the explanation might be youve been fooled by a simple olfactory misdirection little bit like ventriloquism of the nose its an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy but it has got to be said i dont like the looks of that hydroconometer it seems to be indicating youve got energy feedback all the way through the retrostabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converters oh because if theres one thing you shouldnt have done you shouldnt have let me press all those buttons but in fairness i will give you one word of advice run
39734,its done
39735,hes in here somewhere
39736,yes

39763,the same way we did the touch of an angel same one probably since you ended up in the same year no no no no no dont get up time travel without a capsule nasty catch your breath dont go swimming for half an hour
39764,fascinating race the weeping angels the only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely no mess no fuss they just zap you into the past and let you live to death the rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye you die in the past and in the present they consume the energy of all the days you might have had all your stolen moments theyre creatures of the abstract they live off potential energy
39765,tracked you down with this this is my timeywimey detector it goes ding when theres stuff also it can boil an egg at thirty paces whether you want it to or not actually so ive learned to stay away from hens its not pretty when they blow
39766,normally id offer you a lift home but somebody nicked my motor so i need you to take a message to sally sparrow and im sorry billy i am very very sorry its going to take you a while
39767,im a time traveller or i was im stuck in 1969  martha
39768,hello sorry bit of a rush theres a sort of thing happening fairly important we stop it
39769,look sorry ive got a bit of a complex life things dont always happen to me in quite the right order gets a bit confusing at times especially at weddings im rubbish at weddings especially my own
39770,what hasnt happened
39771,got what
39772,yeah listen listen got to dash things happening well four things well four things and a lizard
39773,what was your name
39774,good to meet you sally sparrow
39775,ah but the thing about cardiff its built on a rift in time and space just like california and the san andreas fault but the rift bleeds energy every now and then i need to open up the engines soak up the energy and use it as fuel
39776,exactly should only take twenty seconds the rifts been active
39777,bit of trouble with the slitheen
39778,were accelerating into the future the year one billion five billion five trillion fifty trillion what the year one hundred trillion thats impossible
39779,were going to the end of the universe
39780,i dont know
39781,not even the time lords came this far we should leave we should go we should really really go
39782,hello again oh im sorry
39783,i think he came with us
39784,must have been clinging to the outside of the tardis all the way through the vortex well thats very him

39794,told you
39795,i was busy
39796,you two were at the end of the universe all right right at the edge of knowledge itself and youre busy blogging come on

39842,quite right too and i must say professor er what was it
39843,professor yana this new science is well beyond me but all the same a boost reversal circuit in any time frame must be a circuit which reverses the boost so i wonder what would happen if i did this
39844,oh weve been chatting away i forgot to tell you im brilliant    atillo
39845,is this
39846,thats food youve built this system out of food and string and staples professor yana youre a genius
39847,oh its easy coming in at the end but youre stellar this is this is magnificent and i dont often say that because well because of me
39848,if youd been born in a different time youd be revered i mean it throughout the galaxies
39849,well youve got it now but that footprint engine thing you cant activate it from onboard its got to be from here youre staying behind
39850,youd give your life so they could fly
39851,ah

39864,well
39865,lieutenant get on board the rocket i promise youre going to fly
39866,trust me weve found a way of tripping the system run
39867,well by the looks of it id say the stet radiation doesnt affect clothing only flesh
39868,ever since i ran away from you good luck
39869,well the only man youre ever going to be happy with
39870,hmm
39871,lieutenant everyone on board  atillo
39872,ah nearly there the footprint its a gravity pulse it stamps down the rocket shoots up bit primitive itll take the both of us to keep it stable
39873,dont be ridiculous

39932,youve been watching too much tv
39933,well perfect to look at maybe and it was it was beautiful they used to call it the shining world of the seven systems and on the continent of wild endeavour in the mountains of solace and solitude there stood the citadel of the time lords the oldest and most mighty race in the universe looking down on the galaxies below sworn never to interfere only to watch children of gallifrey taken from their families age of eight to enter the academy and some say thats when it all began when he was a child thats when the master saw eternity as a novice he was taken for initiation he stood in front of the untempered schism its a gap in the fabric of reality through which could be seen the whole of the vortex you stand there eight years old staring at the raw power of time and space just a child some would be inspired some would run away and some would go mad brr i dont know
39934,oh the ones that ran away i never stopped
39935,patch it through to the laptop
39936,you work for torchwood
39937,everything torchwood did and youre part of it

39939,its in the phones oh i said he was a hypnotist wait wait wait hold on
39940,no no no no no its subtler than that any stronger and people would question it but contained in that rhythm in layers of code vote saxon believe in me whispering to the world oh yes thats how he hid himself from me because i should have sensed there was another time lord on earth i should have known way back the signal cancelled him out
39941,not from down here but now we know how hes doing it
39942,oh yes
39943,what about now
39944,and back again see it just shifts your perception a tiny little bit doesnt make us invisible just unnoticed oh i know what its like its like its like when you fancy someone and they dont even know you exist thats what its like come on
39945,dont run dont shout just keep your voice down draw attention to yourself and the spell is broken just keep to the shadows
39946,yeah thats what we are ghosts    news 24
39947,dont move
39948,dont
39949,now that sounds like torchwood

39954,dont touch it
39955,it cant be no no no no no no it cant be
39956,hes cannibalised the tardis
39957,its a paradox machine
39958,as soon as this hits red it activates at this speed itll trigger at two minutes past eight
39959,not till i know what its doing touch the wrong bit blow up the solar system
39960,oh ive got a way sorry didnt i mention it      news 24
39961,if i can get this around the masters neck cancel out his perception theyll see him for real its just hard to go unnoticed with everyone on red alert if they stop me youve got a key
39962,stop it stop it now
39963,master just calm down just look at what youre doing just stop if you could see yourself

40001,i really dont mind though come with me
40002,defending the earth cant argue with that
40003,i cant have you walking around with a time travelling teleport you could go anywhere twice the second time to apologise

40005,i really dont know
40006,no
40007,no definitely not no no

40013,what what
40014,now forget your bonapartes your boudiccas your blackbeards even
40015,this martha jones this is baltazar scourge of the galaxy corsair king of triton in the fourteenth century the greatest despot that ever ever lived
40016,yeah it is kind of cool now the thing about baltazar
40017,yeah the most amazing thing about him is he forged this ship himself
40018,by hand go on tell her baltazar
40019,and not that long ago blew all of earths defence forces from the sky you really shouldnt have done that
40020,really so then all carbon based life will be supercompressed in a plasma field making
40021,er precisely yeah well done yes every living being turned into diamonds
40022,now that is a plan that is indeed a plan
40023,hmm by giving him this
40024,i like to stir things up
40025,that wasnt just any old spoon that spoon passed through the hands of the greatest chefs of planet earth fanny delia madame cholette that spoon was an antique forged by the now extinct inhabitants of a planet that specialised in rubicola
40026,oh yes but not just any old fungus no a special hydroxiling fungus theres been no treatment for it these last two thousand years which is why baltazar scourge of the galaxy
40027,no i pepped it up a bit gave it a bit of zing a bit of vavavoom
40028,oh well
40029,oh i imagine so his luck cant hold out for ever
40030,in this era the most likely prison planet would be er volagnoc yeah thats where id take him if it were up to me coldest place in the galaxy
40031,yup now give me a number between zero and ninety nine
40032,and another
40033,another
40034,destination setting and you martha jones have randomly chosen to take us to copacabana beach ariba
40035,yes six hundred and seventy six million miles an hour and a bit rock on
40036,ha whoa
40037,oh search me theres nothing in the manual
40038,volagnoc i was right martha
40039,he eats it
40040,he does
40041,oh thats just a legend
40042,the infinite
40043,well lets just say there are things out there in space martha things that predate our reality relics from the dark times
40044,oh far far more than that there was a time when the universe was so much smaller than it is now a darker older time of chaos creatures like the racnoss the nestines and the great vampires rampaged through the void
40045,its said that if anyone were to find the infinite theyd receive their hearts desire and frankly thats quite a thing to receive
40046,its a data chip part of a black box recorder dark time technology
40047,no the infinite stays lost its nothing more than a legend as last custodian to the secrets of the universe its my duty to see it stays that way
40048,i cant let someone like baltazar someone as corrupt and twisted as he is have access to that kind of power caw youd better be right about this
40049,ah martha see those artificial suns
40050,someone wanted the planet boukon warmed up
40051,oil rigs
40052,it ran out on earth the corporations went drilling elsewhere
40053,you think run
40054,er well im open to suggestions
40055,aye aye captain
40056,well that i didnt expect
40057,hello there captain
40058,hello there im the doctor martha and

40332,no no no reason im just asking but the soothsayers they all consume the vapours yeah
40333,ipso facto
40334,theyre all consuming this
40335,tiny particles of rock theyre breathing in vesuvius
40336,let me try again this lucius petrus dextrus
40337,only if you dont tell mine
40338,well plenty of marble merchants in this town tell them all the same thing get all the components from different places so no one can see what youre building
40339,put this one there this one there er keep that one upside down and what you got
40340,what the soothsayer doesnt know
40341,yeah i knew you were going to say that but its an energy converter
40342,i dont know isnt that brilliant i love not knowing keeps me on my toes it must be awful being a prophet waking up every morning is it raining yes it is i said so takes all the fun out of life but who designed this lucius hmm who gave you these instructions

40356,talk to me thats all i want talk to me just tell me you are dont hurt these people
40357,carapace of stone held together by internal magma not too difficult to stop but i reckon thats just the foot soldier

40359,oh thatll be the day
40360,well thats all right just us girls do you know i met the sibyl once yeah hell of a woman blimey she could dance the tarantella nice teeth truth be told i think she had a bit of a thing for me i said it would never last she said i know well she would you all right there
40361,i like the toga
40362,yeah not so much
40363,let me tell you about the sibyl the founder of this religion she would be ashamed of you all her wisdom and insight turned sour is that how you spread the word hey on the blade of a knife
40364,oh very perceptive where do these words of wisdom come from  high priestess
40365,if i might
40366,who told you that
40367,exactly the people of pompeii are turning to stone before the volcano erupts but why
40368,more to the point why dont you know about it who are you
40369,no no no no im talking to the creature inside you the thing thats seeding itself into a human body in the dust in the lungs taking over the flesh and turning it into what
40370,oh but you can read my mind you know its not i demand you tell me who you are    high priestess
40371,name yourself planet of origin galactic coordinates species designation according to the universal ratification of the shadow proclamation
40372,tell me your name
40373,well thats a pyrovile growing inside her shes a halfway stage
40374,that thing in the villa that was an adult pyrovile
40375,i warn you im armed donna get that grill open
40376,just what are the pyrovile doing here
40377,right creatures of stone shattered on impact when was that seventeen years ago
40378,okay so seventeen years ago woke you up and now youre using human bodies to reconstitute yourselves but why the psychic powers
40379,okay thats fine so you force yourself inside a human brain use the latent psychic talent to bond i get that i get that yeah but seeing the future that is way beyond psychic you can see through time where does the gift of prophecy come from
40380,now get down
40381,yes down there why cant this lot predict a volcano why is it being hidden
40382,yeah but its got to sting
40383,this way
40384,into the volcano
40385,yes way appian way    high priestess
40386,still part of history
40387,some things are fixed some things are in flux pompeii is fixed
40388,because thats how i see the universe every waking second i can see what is what was what could be what must not thats the burden of a time lord donna and im the only one left
40389,stop it
40390,twenty thousand
40391,they know were here come on
40392,its the heart of vesuvius were right inside the mountain
40393,whats that thing
40394,thats how they arrived or whats left of it escape pod prison ship gene bank
40395,oh its worse than that
40396,come on
40397,well we cant go back
40398,now then lucius my lords pyrovillian dont get yourselves in a lather in a lava no no but if i might beg the wisdom of the gods before we perish once this new race of creatures is complete then what
40399,what do you mean gone wheres it gone
40400,yeah i should warn you its seventy percent water out there
40401,then the whole planet is at stake thank you thats all i needed to know donna
40402,see the energy converter takes the lava uses the power to create a fusion matrix which welds pyrovile to human now its complete they can convert millions
40403,of course i can but dont you see thats why the soothsayers cant see the volcano there is no volcano vesuvius is never going to erupt the pyrovile are stealing all its power theyre going to use it to take over the world
40404,i can invert the system set off the volcano and blow them up yes but thats the choice donna its pompeii or the world
40405,if pompeii is destroyed then its not just history its me i make it happen
40406,vesuvius explodes with the force of twenty four nuclear bombs nothing can survive it certainly not us
40407,push this lever and its over twenty thousand people
40408,it was an escape pod
40409,come on
40410,dont you think ive done enough historys back in place and everyone dies
40411,no its not
40412,thats just it dont you see donna cant you understand if i could go back and save them then i would but i cant i can never go back i cant i just cant i cant
40413,come with me
40414,the explosion was so powerful it cracked open a rift in time just for a second thats what gave you the gift of prophecy it echoed back into the pyrovillian alternative but not any more youre free
40415,oh i was never here dont tell anyone
40416,yeah you were right sometimes i need someone welcome aboard
40417,set the controls to random mystery tour outside that door could be any planet anywhere anywhen in the whole wide u are you all right
40418,i could always take you home
40419,i know what its like everything youre feeling right now the fear the joy the wonder i get that
40420,yeah why do you think i keep going
40421,snow oh real snow proper snow at last thats more like it lovely what do you think
40422,look at that view
40423,millions of planets millions of galaxies and were on this one molto bene bellissimo says donna born in chiswick all youve got is a life of work and sleep and telly and rent and tax and takeaway dinners all birthdays and christmases and two weeks holiday a year and then you end up here donna noble citizen of the earth standing on a different planet how about that donna
40424,better
40425,comfy
40426,can you hear anything inside that
40427,all right i was saying citizen of the earth
40428,hold on can you hear that donna take your hood down
40429,that noise is like a song over there
40430,an ood hes called an ood
40431,donna dont not now its a he not an it give me a hand
40432,i dont know where the heart is i dont know if hes got a heart talk to him keep him going
40433,no no no no you dont need to
40434,youve been shot  delta 50
40435,circle what do you mean delta 50 what circle delta 50 what circle
40436,careful
40437,the snowll take care of that
40438,theyre servants of humans in the forty second century mildly telepathic that was the song it was his mind calling out
40439,his eyes turned red
40440,trouble come on the ood are harmless theyre completely benign except the last time i met them there was this force like a stronger mind powerful enough to take them over
40441,oh long story
40442,it was the devil
40443,must be something different this time though something closer to home ah ha civilisation
40444,sorry sorry sorry late dont mind us hello the guards let us through
40445,the doctor and donna noble
40446,oh no no no no were not married
40447,never
40448,oh whats that that sounds like an alarm
40449,ah got it the ood sphere ive been to this solar system before years ago ages close to the planet sense sphere lets widen out the year 4126 that is the second great and bountiful human empire
40450,its good isnt it
40451,bit full but you see the empire stretches out across three galaxies
40452,yeah that thing about the bees is odd
40453,sometimes i wonder
40454,ood distribution centres
40455,back to the point
40456,what do you mean what circle  ood 1
40457,ive had enough of the schmoozing do you fancy going off the beaten track
40458,yeah
40459,last time i met the ood i never thought i never asked
40460,i was busy so busy i couldnt save them i had to let the ood die i reckon i owe them one
40461,lets keep out of his way come on
40462,whered you learn to whistle
40463,ood export you see lifts up the containers takes them to the rocket sheds ready to be flown out all over the three galaxies
40464,what do you think
40465,hundred more
40466,its not so different from your time
40467,who do you think made your clothes
40468,sorry
40469,ood tell me does the circle mean anything to you
40470,but what is it what is the circle
40471,why
40472,whereve you gone
40473,donna where are you
40474,if you dont do what she says youre really in trouble not from me from her
40475,there we go safe and sound
40476,solana the ood arent born like this they cant be a species born to serve could never evolve in the first place what does the company do to make them obey
40477,oh what because you dont ask
40478,wheres he what part of the complex i could help with the red eye now show me
40479,come with me youve seen the warehouse you cant agree with all this you know this place better than me you could help
40480,oh can you hear it i didnt need the map i should have listened
40481,listen listen listen listen listen
40482,cant you hear it the singing
40483,thats because theyre natural born ood unprocessed before theyre adapted to slavery unspoilt thats their song
40484,do you want to
40485,its the song of captivity
40486,face me
40487,sure
40488,its okay
40489,all the time
40490,ah let them
40491,its a brain a hind brain the ood are born with a secondary brain like the amygdala in humans it processes memory and emotions you get rid of that you wouldnt be donna any more youd be like an ood a processed ood
40492,and they stitch on the translator
40493,what you going to do then arrest me lock me up throw me in a cage well youre too late ha
40494,if thats what friends of the ood are trying to prove then yes
40495,thats because you cant hear them
40496,oh nice one
40497,whats happening
40498,but mister halpen theres something else isnt there something we havent seen
40499,a creature couldnt survive with a separate forebrain and hind brain theyd be at war with themselves theres got to be something else a third element am i right
40500,but its got to be connected to the red eye what is it
40501,come on
40502,these are really good handcuffs
40503,doctor donna friends
40504,doctor donna friends
40505,doctor donna friends
40506,friends friends friends
40507,i dont know where it is i dont know where theyve gone
40508,it might be underground like some sort of cave or a cavern or
40509,all right
40510,the ood brain now it all makes sense thats the missing link the third element binding them together forebrain hind brain and this the telepathic centre its a shared mind connecting all the ood in song
40511,those pylons
40512,damping the telepathic field stopping the ood from connecting for two hundred years
40513,maybe its taken centuries to adapt the subconscious reaching out
40514,what is that stuff
40515,oh dear
40516,funny thing the subconscious takes all sorts of shapes came out in the red eye as revenge came out in the rabid ood as anger and then there was patience all that intelligence and mercy focused on ood sigma hows the hair loss mister halpen
40517,oh theyve been preparing you for a very long time and now youre standing next to the ood brain mister halpen can you hear it listen
40518,yep
40519,i noticed
40520,its better that way people who know for certain tend to be like mister halpen
40521,oh yes stifled for two hundred years but not any more the circle is broken the ood can sing
40522,the message has gone out that song resonated across the galaxies everyone heard it everyone knows the rockets are bringing them back the ood are coming home
40523,oh ive ive sort of got a song of my own thanks
40524,meaning
40525,yeah er what about you you still want to go home
40526,then well be off
40527,always
40528,no neither can i oh careful
40529,well someone did

40540,and youre qualified now youre a proper doctor
40541,wish i could say the same
40542,oh dont salute
40543,yeah long time ago back in the 70s or was it the 80s but it was all a bit more homespun back then
40544,yeah thats enough of the sir
40545,tell me whats going on in that factory
40546,you mean they died simultaneously
40547,how did they die
40548,what have the cars got in common
40549,whats atmos
40550,zero no carbon none at all
40551,and you think atmos is alien
40552,you mustve checked it before it went on sale
40553,really whod you get oh right me yes good
40554,a very good question
40555,do you know how many cars there are on planet earth eight hundred million imagine that if you could control them youd have eight hundred million weapons
40556,ionising nanomembrane carbon dioxide converter which means that atmos works filters the co2 at a molecular level
40557,no decades ahead of its time look do you mind could you stand back a bit
40558,youre carrying a gun i dont like people with guns hanging around me all right
40559,well its true
40560,people with guns are usually the enemy in my books you seem quite at home
40561,oh right so its my fault
40562,suppose not
40563,yeah thats more like martha jones
40564,well
40565,why where have you been
40566,why whats inside it or whats not inside it
40567,so this this atmos thing whered it come from
40568,and himself would be
40569,a hothouse for geniuses wouldnt mind going there i get lonely
40570,you are not coming with me i want to talk to this luke rattigan not point a gun at him
40571,well then get me a jeep
40572,yeah but if there is a danger of hostile aliens i think its best to keep a superduper time machine away from the front lines
40573,yeah i dont do orders
40574,i said no salutes
40575,oh youre getting a bit cheeky you are
40576,oh just in time come on come on were going to the country fresh air and geniuses what more could you ask
40577,really
40578,oh if thats what you want i mean its a bit soon i had so many places i had wanted to take you the fifteenth broken moon of the medusa cascade the lightning skies of cotter pallunis world diamond coral reefs of kataa flo ko thank you thank you donna noble its been brilliant youve youve saved my life in so many ways youre  youre just popping home for a visit thats what you mean
40579,and then youre coming back
40580,yeah
40581,i know i know
40582,bye
40583,ross one question if unit think that atmos is dodgy
40584,oh nice one
40585,yeah yeah you did
40586,is it pe i wouldnt mind a kick around ive got me daps on
40587,hello
40588,ah but i havent got a commanding officer have you oh this is ross say hello ross
40589,lets have a look then i can smell genius in a good way
40590,if only that were possible conditional clause
40591,he called you a grunt dont call ross a grunt hes nice we like ross look at this place
40592,i was just thinking what a responsible eighteen year old inventing zero carbon cars saving the world
40593,mmm blinkered vision because atmos means more people driving more cars more petrol end result the oils going to run out faster than ever the atmos system could make things worse
40594,its been a long time since anyone said no to you isnt it
40595,not easy is it being clever you look at the world and you connect things random things and think why cant anyone else see it the rest of the world is so slow
40596,and youre all on your own
40597,but not with this because theres no way you invented this thing single handed i mean it might be earth technology but thats like finding a mobile phone in the middle ages no no ill tell you what its like its like finding this in the middle of someones front room albeit its a very big front room
40598,yeah just looks like a thing doesnt it people dont question things they just say oh its a thing

40609,no its a good weakness
40610,no but the sontarans are fed by a probic vent in the back of their neck thats their weak spot which means they always have to face their enemies in battle isnt that brilliant they can never turn their backs
40611,yeah well stare at this
40612,greyhound forty to trap one repeat can you hear me over

40654,ah the wars not going so well then losing are we  staal
40655,the war between the sontarans and the rutans its been raging far out in the stars for fifty thousand years fifty thousand years of bloodshed and for what       staal
40656,finished  staal
40657,oh youd be surprised
40658,it must be something the sontarans invented this isnt just poison they need this gas for something else what could that be
40659,what i told you not to launch
40660,youre making a mistake colonel for once i hope the sontarans are ahead of you
40661,missiles wouldnt even dent that ship so why are the sontarans so keen to stop you any ideas  martha 2
40662,get them out of there
40663,he wasnt greyhound forty his name was ross now listen to me and get them out of there
40664,why they dont need it why attack now what are they up to times like this i could do with the brigadier no offence
40665,because they wanted unit here you gave them something they needed something now hidden inside the factory something precious
40666,its the bullets it causes expansion of the copper shell
40667,for the billionth time you cant fight sontarans
40668,yeah i havent got a remote though i really should i need you on that ship thats why i made them move             doctor
40669,i know and i wouldnt ask but theres nothing else i can do the whole planet is choking donna
40670,on his collar theres a sort of plug like a hole the probic vent    doctor
40671,im sorry i swear im so sorry but youve got to try
40672,oh you are brilliant you are
40673,i said you dont stand a chance
40674,wouldnt dream of it
40675,are you my mummy
40676,but the sontarans have got lasers you cant even see in this fog the night vision doesnt work
40677,its the valiant
40678,whoa thats brilliant
40679,no not at all not me
40680,nah you and me martha jones just like old times

40682,oh blimey im busy got it     doctor
40683,the gas tell us about the gas  martha 2
40684,clonefeed its clonefeed
40685,like amniotic fluid for sontarans thats why theyre not invading theyre converting the atmosphere changing the planet into a clone world earth becomes a great big hatchery because the sontarans are clones thats how they reproduce give them a planet this big theyll create billions of new soldiers the gas isnt poison its food  martha 2
40686,hold on hold on get off me get off me got to bring the tardis down
40687,just keep pressing n we want to keep those missiles on the ground
40688,yeah long story here we go the old team back together well the new team
40689,no no no no i needed to get the teleport working so that we could get to
40690,if i see one more gun
40691,thats why the sontarans had to stop the missiles they were holding back because caesofine gas is volatile thats why they had to use you to stop the nuclear attack ground to air engagement could spark off the whole thing
40692,yeah they need all the gas intact to breed their clone army and all the time we had luke here in his dream factory planning a little trip were we
40693,you were building equipment ready to terraform el mondo luko so that humans could live there and breathe the air with this an atmospheric converter
40694,if i can get this on the right setting
40695,yeah i did didnt i
40696,now were in trouble
40697,right so donna thank you for everything martha you too oh so many times luke do something clever with your life  donna

40710,not impossible just a bit unlikely
40711,were unarmed look no weapons never any weapons were safe
40712,oi oi whats wrong with clean hands
40713,something tells me this isnt about to check my blood pressure argh
40714,its taken a tissue sample ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow and extrapolated it some kind of accelerator
40715,what on earth thats just
40716,from me
40717,well shes well shes my daughter
40718,mmm technically
40719,progenation reproduction from a single organism means one parent is biological mother and father you take a sample of diploid cells split them into haploids then recombine them in a different arrangement and grow very quickly apparently
40720,im not detonating anything
40721,martha no dont
40722,but theyve got my friend
40723,im going to find her
40724,the machine must embed military history and tactics but no name shes a generated anomaly
40725,good as anything i suppose
40726,they stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it its not what i call natural parenting
40727,you cant extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident
40728,look just because i share certain physiological traits with simian primates doesnt make me a monkeys uncle does it
40729,so where are we what planets this
40730,maybe theyre doing miss saigon
40731,general cobb i presume

40737,does this show the entire city including the hath zones
40738,well itll help us find martha
40739,ooo the source whats that then whats a source i like a source what is it
40740,and that would be
40741,right so its a creation myth
40742,ah i thought so theres a suppressed layer of information in this map if i can just
40743,see a whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight
40744,er call me oldfashioned but if you really wanted peace couldnt you just stop fighting
40745,hang on hang on a second ago it was peace in our time now youre talking about genocide
40746,then you need to get yourself a better dictionary when you do look up genocide youll see a little picture of me there and the caption will read over my dead body
40747,no were were not a couple
40748,im going to stop you cobb you need to know that
40749,this
40750,makes as much sense as the breath of life story
40751,yes but there could still be something real in that temple something thats become a myth a piece of technology a weapon
40752,oh yes
40753,thats why we need to get out of here find martha and stop cobb from slaughtering the hath what what are you what are you what are you staring at
40754,no no im trying to stop the fighting

40835,the gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process

40929,well poison drink up ive laced the soup with pepper

40935,what does a vespiform want
40936,youre right ah ive been so caught up with giant wasps that ive forgotten youre the expert
40937,no no no no no no no because plenty of people write detective stories but yours are the best and why why are you so good agatha christie because you understand youve lived youve fought youve had your heart broken you know about people their passions their hope and despair and anger all of those tiny huge things that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer just think agatha if anyone can solve this its you
40938,and it was no ordinary pregnancy
40939,excuse me agatha this is my territory but when you heard that buzzing sound in the dining room you said it cant be why did you say that
40940,thank you at this point when we consider the lies and the secrets and the key to these events then we have to consider it was you donna noble
40941,no but you said it all along the vital clue this whole thing is being acted out like a murder mystery which means it was you agatha christie
40942,no but she wrote she wrote those brilliant clever books and whos her greatest admirer  the moving finger
40943,no but just think last thursday night what were you doing
40944,just think what else happened on thursday night
40945,you said on the lawn this afternoon last thursday night those boys broke into your church
40946,really a man of god against two strong lads a man in his forties or should i say forty years old exactly
40947,lady eddison your child how old would he be now
40948,your child has come home
40949,oh you said you were taught by the christian fathers meaning you were raised in an orphanage

40957,come on
40958,time is in flux donna for all we know this is the night agatha christie loses her life and history gets changed
40959,the lake shes heading for the lake whats she doing
40960,its mind is based on her thought processes theyre linked
40961,dont hurt her youre not meant to be like this youve got the wrong template in your mind
40962,donna that thing couldnt help itself
40963,needs a bit of work
40964,oh its the firestone its part of the vespiforms mind its dying and its connected to agatha
40965,of course the amnesia wiped her mind of everything that happened the wasp the murders
40966,yeah but weve solved another riddle the mystery of agatha christie and tomorrow morning her car gets found by the side of a lake a few days later she turns up in hotel at harrogate with no idea of what just happened
40967,shameful story theyd never talk of it too british while the unicorn does a bunk back to london town she can never even say she was there
40968,oh great life met another man married again saw the world wrote and wrote and wrote
40969,the thing is i dont think she ever quite forgot great mind like that some of the details kept bleeding through all the stuff her imagination could use like miss marple
40970,and where is it where is it hold on here we go
40971,somewhere in the back of her mind it all lingered and thats not all look at the copyright page
40972,people never stop reading them she is the best selling novelist of all time

41093,you dont have a suit youre not safe
41094,donna let me explain
41095,did you feel anything like an energy transfer anything at all

41103,its a swarm in a suit but its learning
41104,squareness gun
41105,but any shadow
41106,trying to boost the power light doesnt stop them but it slows them down
41107,your screwdriver looks exactly like mine
41108,i dont give my screwdriver to anyone
41109,who are you
41110,i teleported donna back to the tardis if we dont get back there in under five hours emergency program one will activate
41111,shes not there i should have received a signal the console signals me if theres a teleport breach
41112,donna noble theres a donna noble somewhere in this library do you have the software to locate her position
41113,donna
41114,donna
41115,no the signals definitely coming from the moon im blocking it but its trying to break through donna
41116,im doing it
41117,maybe its getting harder to tell whats wrong with you
41118,they wont attack until theres enough of them but theyve got our scent now theyre coming
41119,theres a signal coming from somewhere interfering with it
41120,it doesnt have a red setting
41121,it doesnt have dampers
41122,so some time in the future i just give you my screwdriver
41123,why would i do that
41124,and i know that because
41125,less emotional im not emotional
41126,young who are you
41127,yeah were good
41128,know whats interesting about my screwdriver very hard to interfere with practically nothings strong enough well some hairdryers but im working on that so there is a very strong signal coming from somewhere and it wasnt there before so whats new whats changed come on whats new whats different  dave 2
41129,whats a doctor moon
41130,well still active its signalling look someone somewhere in this library is alive and communicating with the moon or possibly alive and drying their hair no the signal is definitely coming from the moon im blocking it but its trying to break through
41131,donna
41132,hold on hold on hold on im trying to find the wavelength argh im being blocked
41133,hang on
41134,no no no i just tinted her visor maybe theyll think theyre already in there leave her alone
41135,maybe i dont know its a swarm its not like we chat
41136,just just just stay back professor a quick word please
41137,down here  they crouch down
41138,look you said there are five people still alive in this room
41139,so why are there six
41140,run
41141,professor go ahead find a safe spot
41142,five minutes
41143,you hear that those words that is the very last thought of the man who wore that suit before you climbed inside and stripped his flesh thats a mans soul trapped inside a neural relay going round and round forever now if you dont have the decency to let him go how about this use him talk to me its easy neural relay just point and think use him talk to me
41144,the vashta nerada live on all the worlds in this system but you hunt in forests what are you doing in a library
41145,in a minute you came to the library to hunt why just tell me why
41146,oh hello
41147,take it easy youll get the hang of it did not what
41148,well of course you did of course you came here
41149,from here
41150,but you hatch from trees from spores in trees
41151,youre nowhere near a forest look around you
41152,youre not in a forest youre in a library there are no trees in a  library
41153,books you came in the books microspores in a million million books  dave 2
41154,oh dave oh dave im so sorry
41155,thing about me im stupid i talk too much always babbling on this gob doesnt stop for anything want to know the only reason im still alive always stay near the door
41156,spoilers nobody can open a tardis by snapping their fingers it doesnt work like that
41157,i am the doctor
41158,how are you doing
41159,not coming sorry
41160,i dont know maybe tinting your visors making a difference
41161,can i get you anything
41162,im all over it
41163,safe
41164,safe you dont say saved nobody says saved you say safe the data fragment what did it say
41165,nobody says saved nutters say saved you say safe you see it didnt mean safe it meant it literally meant saved
41166,see there it is right there a hundred years ago massive power surge all the teleports going at once soon as the vashta nerada hit their hatching cycle they attack someone hits the alarm the computer tries to teleport everyone out
41167,it succeeded pulled them all out but then what nowhere to send them nowhere safe in the whole library vashta nerada growing in every shadow four thousand and twenty two people all beamed up and nowhere to go theyre stuck in the system waiting to be sent like emails so whats a computer to do what does a computer always do
41168,the library a whole world of books and right at the core the biggest hard drive in history the index to everything ever written backup copies of every single book the computer saved four thousand and twenty two people the only way a computer can it saved them to the hard drive
41169,in twenty minutes this planets going to crack like an egg
41170,no no no no no no no
41171,what is it what is cal
41172,its at the core of the planet
41173,i bet i like you
41174,the data core over four thousand living minds trapped inside it
41175,the computers in sleep mode i cant wake it up im trying
41176,i know youd think it was dreaming
41177,cal is a child a child hooked up to a mainframe why didnt you tell me this i needed to know this
41178,so you werent protecting a patent you were protecting her
41179,and then the shadows came
41180,and she saved them she saved everyone in the library folded them into her dreams and kept them safe
41181,because shes forgotten shes got over four thousand living minds chatting away inside her head it must be like being well me
41182,easy we beam all the people out of the data core the computer will reset and stop the countdown difficult charlotte doesnt have enough memory space left to make the transfer easy ill hook myself up to the computer she can borrow my memory space
41183,yeah its easy to criticise
41184,ill try my hardest not to die honestly its my main thing
41185,im right this works shut up now listen you and luxy boy back up to the main library prime any data cells you can find for maximum download and before you say anything else professor can i just mention in passing as youre here shut up
41186,i know
41187,these are their forests im going to seal charlotte inside her little world take everybody else away the shadows can swarm to their hearts content
41188,best offer theyre going to get
41189,theyd better take it because right now im finding it very hard to make any kind of offer at all you know what i really liked anita she was brave even when she was crying and she never gave in and you ate her

41553,i wonder i cant help noticing youre wearing a fob watch
41554,legend has it that the memories of a time lord can be contained within a watch do you mind
41555,yeah anyway alien infiltration
41556,oh its just me whistling i wonder whats in here though
41557,no what is it whats wrong
41558,a friend i swear
41559,ah two words i never refuse but its not a conversation for a dead mans house itll make more sense if we go back to the tardis your tardis hold on i just need to do a little final check wont take a tick theres one more thing i cannot figure if this rooms got infostamps then maybe just maybe its got something that needs infostamping
41560,stairs cant lead them outside
41561,im a dab hand with a cutlass you dont want to come near me when ive got one of these this is your last warning no olay this is really your last warning okay i give up
41562,listen to me properly whatever youre doing stuck in 1851 i can help i mean it im the only person in the world who can help you listen to me
41563,im the doctor you need me check your memory banks my names the doctor leave this man alone the doctor is me
41564,the doctor remember im the doctor you need me alive you need the doctor and thats me
41565,infostamp with a cyclosteinham core you ripped open the core and broke the safety zap only the doctor would think of that
41566,come here youll be okay let me just check
41567,oh i was just protecting you
41568,well find out you and me together
41569,im looking forward to this     next doctor you were right though rosita the reverend fairchilds death was the work of the cybermen
41570,and wheres the tardis now
41571,er whats all this luggage
41572,yes yes i am yeah yeah
41573,well a dead mans
41574,yeah oh now look jackson lake had an infostamp
41575,doctor the answer to all this is in your tardis can i see it
41576,youve got a balloon
41577,well i do now i like it good tardis brilliant nice one and is it inflated by gas yeah
41578,youve got quite a bit of money
41579,youve never actually been up
41580,the perfect escape do you ever wonder what youre escaping from
41581,then do you want me to tell you because i think ive worked it out now how you became the doctor what do you think do you want to know
41582,the story begins with the cybermen a long time away and not so far from here the cybermen were fought and they were beaten and they were sent into a howling wilderness called the void locked inside forever more but then a greater battle rose up so great that everything inside the void perished but as the walls of the world weakened the last of the cybermen must have fallen through the dimensions back in time to land here and they found you
41583,at the same time another man came to london mister jackson lake plenty of luggage money in his pocket maybe coming to town for the winter season i dont know but he found the cybermen too and just like you exactly like you he took hold of an infostamp
41584,you said no body was ever found and you kept all his suitcases but you could never bring yourself to open them i told you the answer was in the fob watch can i see
41585,you became the doctor because the infostamp you picked up was a book about one particular man
41586,time lord tardis enemy of the cybermen the one and the only you see the infostamp must have backfired streamed all that information about me right inside your head
41587,no no no no no infostamps are just facts and figures all that bravery saving rosita defending london town hmm and the invention building a tardis thats all you
41588,theres still something missing isnt there
41589,sorry really i am so sorry but thats an awful lot of luggage for one man because an infostamp is plain technology its not enough to make a man lose his mind what you suffered is called a fugue a fugue state where the mind just runs away because it cant bear to look back you wanted to become someone else because jackson lake had lost so much
41590,oh you found a whole cache of infostamps
41591,activation a call to arms the cybermen are moving
41592,oh nothing as holy as that
41593,wheres that
41594,but what for
41595,yeah thats too well guarded well have to find another way in
41596,listen just walk towards me slowly dont let them touch you
41597,even if theyve converted you thats not a cyber speech pattern youve still got free will im telling you step away
41598,im the doctor
41599,yeah but thats because your database got corrupted oh look look look check this the doctors infostamp
41600,oh well nice try
41601,hello
41602,no no oh but let me die happy tell me what do you need those children for
41603,but for what

41605,the birth of what
41606,run come on
41607,can i say i completely disapprove come on
41608,that stronghold down by the river i need to find a way in
41609,that might be our way in brilliant
41610,maybe you should go back
41611,it mustve been guarding this a dimension vault stolen from the daleks again thats how the cybermen travelled through time jackson is this it the thing you couldnt remember
41612,not enough power come on avanti
41613,they want us thats what cybermen are human beings with their brains put into metal shells they want every living thing to be like them
41614,its an engine theyre generating electricity but what for
41615,no no no no no no no
41616,no its weird the softwares rewriting itself its changing
41617,whoa what the hells happening its out of control
41618,theyre disposable come on

41625,come on jackson you know me
41626,head for the street
41627,gotcha
41628,its a ship dreadnought class front line of an invasion and inside the chest a cyberfactory ready to convert millions
41629,just head south take him south go to the parkland
41630,to stop that thing
41631,jackson youve got your son youve got a reason to live
41632,oh good man jed wasnt it jed i need your help
41633,ill give you five pound notes
41634,the tardis is going to fly
41635,its been said before now give me
41636,nope never
41637,oh get on with it
41638,miss hartigan im offering you a choice you might have the most remarkable mind this world has ever seen strong enough to control the cybermen themselves
41639,no but such a mind deserves to live the cybermen came to this world using a dimension vault i can use that device to find you a home with no people to convert but a new world where you can live out your mechanical life in peace
41640,because if you dont ill have to stop you
41641,no the question is what do you make of me
41642,you make me into this
41643,i wasnt trying to kill you all i did was break the cyberconnection leaving your mind open open i think for the first time in far too many years so you can see just look at yourself look at what youve done
41644,ooo now youre ready
41645,yeah funny that
41646,now take care of that one shes marvellous

41671,no it tastes like never mind
41672,oh humans on buses always blaming me look look if you must know i was tracking a hole in the fabric of reality call it a hobby but it was a tiny little hole no danger to anyone suddenly it gets big and we drive right through it
41673,all right you want proof we drove through this
41674,the bus came through but we cant
41675,no no dont
41676,i said dont
41677,it was the bus look at the damage that was the bus protecting us great big box of metal
41678,well slightly different dynamics with a wormhole theres enough metal to make it work i think i hope
41679,id say nine and a half tons but the point still stands yes
41680,yes at last thank you so
41681,yes maam
41682,hello
41683,i thought you were in charge
41684,right so the wormhole we were in the wrong place at the wrong time it was just an accident
41685,how do you know
41686,tell me carmen how many fingers am i holding up
41687,very good low level psychic ability exacerbated by an alien sun what can you see carmen tell me whats out there
41688,what is it
41689,all right now stop it everyone stop it angela look at me angela angela answer me one question angela thats it at me at me there we go angela just answer me one thing when you got on this bus where were you going

41700,thats my boys see we lay a flat surface between the bus and the wormhole like duckboards and we reverse into it
41701,oh thats good
41702,got anything else in there
41703,oh no buses dont have keys theres a master switch then its one button to start the other one to stop yeah
41704,ooo that doesnt sound too good
41705,off you go then try stripping the air filter fast as you can back in two ticks
41706,easier if you left that backpack behind
41707,a backpack with a spade and an axe christina whos going so far away and yet scared by the sound of a siren who are you
41708,we make quite a couple
41709,i dont know but every single instinct of mine is telling me to get off this planet right now
41710,i live in hope
41711,ooo thats handy because im a lord  christina seriously the lord of where
41712,like
41713,anyway come on allonsy
41714,oh we were made for each other
41715,but getting closer

41718,oh i hate these things
41719,thank you angela  woman
41720,did you just salute
41721,no and were not going to but im stuck i havent got the tardis and i need to analyse that wormhole
41722,yes i am hello malcolm
41723,really what was your favourite the giant robot no no hold on lets sort out that wormhole excuse me
41724,malcolm somethings not making sense here ive got a storm and a wormhole and i cant help thinking theres a connection i need a complete full range analysis
41725,no no no no no no thatll never work listen  taylor
41726,you named a unit of measurement after yourself
41727,right fine but before i die of old age which in my case would be quite an achievement so congratulations on that
41728,no malcolm thats brilliant so you can actually measure the wormhole okay
41729,send this back to earth see if malcolm can analyse the storm
41730,like metal why would there be metal in a storm
41731,hold on busy
41732,thats wait i shout wait people usually wait
41733,every language  thats begging for mercy
41734,ooo youre learning
41735,no no no no no look at the ship its a wreck they crashed just like us
41736,oh this is beautiful intact it must have been magnificent a proper streamlined deep spacer
41737,oh right good yes hello thats a telepathic translator he can understand us
41738,thats what i said he can understand us it doesnt work the other way round  you will suffer for your crimes etcetera you have committed an act of violence against the tritovore race tritovores theyre called tritovores you came here in the two hundred to destroy us sorry whats the two hundred
41739,oh no look i think youre making the same mistake christina did im the doctor by the way and this is christina the honourable lady christina at least i hope shes honourable we got pulled through that wormhole the two hundred doesnt look like that normally its broken just the same as you
41740,they believe me
41741,ive got a very honest face and the translator says im telling the truth plus the face right so first things first theres a very strange storm heading our way can you send out a probe oh theyve lost power hmm the crash knocked the mainline crystallography out of synch but if i can jiggle it back
41742,we have been for quite a while
41743,its good isnt it  christina wonderful
41744,they feed off what others leave behind from their behind if you see what i mean its perfectly natural they are flies
41745,san helios city
41746,thousands of times  christina that lordship of yours the lord of where exactly  doctor of time i come from a race of people called time lords
41747,yeah but you dont have to kiss me either
41748,you look time lord anyway
41749,i dont think its that simple were in the city right now
41750,the image was taken last year
41751,i said there was something in the sand the city the oceans the mountains the wildlife and a hundred billion people turned to sand all those voices in carmens head shes hearing them die
41752,something destroyed the whole of san helois
41753,its the probe its reached the storm
41754,its not a storm
41755,billions oh weve lost the probe i think it got eaten everything on this planet gets eaten
41756,a hundred miles but at that speed itll be here in twenty minutes no no no theyre not just coming for us they want the wormhole
41757,show the analysis incredible they swarm out of a wormhole strip the planet bare then move on to the next world start the life cycle all over again
41758,they must do
41759,because they need to be no thats bonkers hang on yes oh do you see billions of them flying in formation all around the planet round and round and round faster and faster and faster till they generate a rupture in space the speed of them and the numbers and the size all of that rips the wormhole into existence
41760,because theyre getting closer

41889,sorry sorry but action one that means evacuation yeah
41890,of course the only problem is
41891,the problem is this thing is clever it didnt infect the birds or the insects in the biodome it chose the humans you were chosen and i told you adelaide water can wait tarak changed straight away but when maggie was infected it stayed hidden inside her no doubt so it could infiltrate the central dome which means
41892,and if you take that back to earth one drop just one drop
41893,right i should leave finally i should leave yuri me old mate no point in me seeing the ice field no point at all no adelaide
41894,they tell legends of mars from long ago of a fine and noble race who built an empire out of snow the ice warriors
41895,perhaps they found something down there used their might and their wisdom to freeze it
41896,well youre famous
41897,this moment this precise moment in time its like i mean its only a theory what do i know but i think certain moments in time are fixed tiny precious moments everything else is in flux anything can happen but those certain moments they have to stand this base on mars with you adelaide brooke this is one vital moment what happens here must always happen
41898,i dont know i think something wonderful happens something that started fifty years ago isnt that right
41899,you told your daughter and maybe one day she tells the story to her daughter the day the earth was stolen and moved across the universe and you
41900,but not for revenge
41901,thats what makes you remarkable and thats how you create history
41902,imagine it adelaide if you began a journey that takes the human race all the way out to the stars it begins with you and then your granddaughter you inspire her so that in thirty years susie fontana brooke is the pilot of the first lightspeed ship to proxima centauri and then everywhere with her children and her childrens children forging the way to the dragon star the celestial belt of the winter queen the map of the watersnake wormholes one day a brooke will even fall in love with a tandonian prince thats the start of a whole new species but everything starts with you adelaide from fifty years ago to right here today imagine
41903,as consolation
41904,a filter one tiny little filter and then the flood
41905,what about
41906,i dont know  adelaide
41907,i loved you for that imagine imagine you knew something imagine you found yourself somewhere i dont know pompeii
41908,but in doing so you make it happen anything i do just makes it happen
41909,mia take this sealant fix that leak yuri open emergency oxygen adelaide dont just sit there thats better the domes still got integrity its ten feet of steelcombination made in liverpool magnificent workmanship
41910,no because someone told me just recently they said i was going to die they said he will knock four times and i think i know what that means and it doesnt mean right here right now because i dont hear anyone knocking do you
41911,heat they use water so we can use heat works against the ice warriors works against the flood ramp up the environment controls and steam them
41912,yes because there are laws there are laws of time once upon a time there were people in charge of those laws but they died they all died do you know who that leaves me its taken me all these years to realise the laws of time are mine and they will obey me
41913,im not beaten yet ill go outside find the heat regulator
41914,thinka thinka thinka think what have we got not enough oxygen protein packs useless glacier glacier mints minty monty molto bene bunny bonny bish bash bosh argh the room the room look at the room section f whats in section f anyone

42899,nothing bit of an earthquake
42900,manipulate the elements it can trigger earthquakes but dont worry about them
42901,no worry about the tidal waves caused by the earthquake right rosannas throne is the control hub but shes locked the programme so tear out every single wire and circuit in the throne go crazy hit it with a stick anything we need it to shut down and reroute control to the secondary hub which im guessing will also be the generator
42902,rosanna

42923,thats what counts blimey never dropped off like that before well never really im getting on a bit you see dont let the cool gear fool you now whats wrong with the console red flashing lights i bet they mean something
42924,it was a bit similar in some aspects
42925,well all of them
42926,basically
42927,did i say nightmare no more of a really good mare look it doesnt matter we all had some kind of psychic episode we probably jumped a time track or something forget it were back to reality now
42928,listen to me trust nothing from now on trust nothing you see hear or feel
42929,yeah you thought you were awake on the tardis too
42930,yeah youre home youre also dreaming trouble is rory amy which is which are we flashing forwards or backwards hold on tight this is going be a tricky one
42931,i threw it in a supernova
42932,because i disagreed with it stop talking to me when im cross
42933,if we were dreaming of the future
42934,yeah and we could still be in upper leadworth dreaming of this dont you get it
42935,and you thought you were definitely awake when you were all elephanty
42936,and you could be giving birth right now this could be the dream i told you trust nothing we see or hear or feel look around you examine everything look for all the details that dont ring true
42937,valid point
42938,it felt solid in the tardis too you cant spot a dream while youre having it
42939,looking for motion blur pixilation it could be a computer simulation i dont think so though
42940,hello youre a doctor
42941,a doctor not a nurse just like youve always dreamed how interesting
42942,your dream wife your dream job probably your dream baby maybe this is your dream
42943,whats that
42944,you said everyone here lives to their nineties theres something here that doesnt make sense lets go and poke it with a stick
42945,oh easy d96 compound plus no you dont have that yet forget that
42946,slightly keen to move on freak psychic schism to sort out youre incredibly old arent you
42947,the heatings off
42948,yeah put on a jumper thats what i always do
42949,i wouldnt believe her nice old lady act if i were you
42950,everythings off sensors core power were drifting the scanners down so we cant even see out we could be anywhere someone something is overriding my controls
42951,how did you get into my tardis what are you
42952,nice look
42953,ill do the talking thank you amy want to take a guess at what that is
42954,dreams delusions cheap tricks
42955,where did you pick up this cheap cabaret act
42956,am i
42957,i dont know its a big universe
42958,maybe because he has no physical form that gets you down after a while so hes taking it out on folk like us who can touch and eat and feel
42959,theyve all gone theyve all gone
42960,one of my tawdry quirks sniffing out things that arent what they seem so come on lets think the mechanics of this reality split were stuck in time asleep exactly matches time in our dream world unlike in conventional dreams
42961,yes sort of communal trance very rare very complicated im sure theres a dream giveaway a tell but my mind isnt working because this village is so dull im slowing down like you two have
42962,okay youre a doctor help her
42963,its okay were doctors
42964,what
42965,sorry
42966,now we all know theres an elephant in the room
42967,no no the hormones seem real but no is nobody going to mention rorys ponytail you hold him down ill cut it off
42968,bow ties are cool i dont know about you but i wouldnt hire mrs poggit as a babysitter whats she doing what does she want
42969,what does it matter if were cold we have to know what she is up to sorry sorry there should be some stuff down there have a look
42970,ah rory wind amy could you attach this to the monitor please
42971,its a generator get winding
42972,rory wind
42973,were in trouble
42974,a star a cold star
42975,sos this one its just burning cold
42976,i cant know everything why does everybody expect me to always
42977,i dont know but there it is and id say weve got about fourteen minutes until we crash into it but thats not a problem
42978,because well have frozen to death by then
42979,stay calm dont get sucked in to it because this just might be the battle that we have to lose
42980,what
42981,play times definitely over
42982,i think they did
42983,leave her alone
42984,drop it drop all of it i know who you are
42985,course i do no idea how you can be here but theres only one person in the universe who hates me as much as you do
42986,hello we were wondering where you went to get reinforcements by the look of it are you all right you look a bit tense
42987,rory
42988,i suspect hes not himself dont get comfortable here you may have to run fast
42989,theres a whole creature inside her inside all of them theyve been there for years living and waiting
42990,run okay leave them leave them talk to me talk to me you are eknodines a proud ancient race youre better than this
42991,planet by upstart neighbours
42992,been living here inside the bodies of old humans for years no wonder they live so long youre keeping them alive
42993,okay makes sense i suppose credible enough could be real
42994,you need to leave this planet
42995,oh pipe down im busy
42996,wait wait stop
42997,the three of us have to agree now which is the dream
42998,no no no ice can burn sofas can read its a big universe we have to agree which battle to lose all of us now
42999,this one
43000,yeah but are we disagreeing or competing
43001,nine minutes till impact
43002,outside brrr how many noughts have you got inside i dont know but i cant feel my feet and other parts
43003,stop competing
43004,yeah because the universe is really small and theres bound to be someone nearby
43005,no were not but our times running out if we fall asleep here were in trouble if we could divide up then wed have an active presence in each world but the dream lord is switching us between the worlds why why whats the logic
43006,amy dont be scared well be back
43007,okay where is it
43008,oh you couldnt live near the shops could you
43009,its okay its only me
43010,come on jump in quickly get in now quickly hurry up are we in
43011,all four quick
43012,everyone in
43013,everybody out out out into the church thats right dont answer the door        dream lord
43014,okay
43015,sorry i had to stop off at the butchers
43016,i dont know i thought the freezing tardis was real but now im not so sure
43017,theyre scared fear generates savagery
43018,not always im sorry
43019,unless we just die
43020,how do you know
43021,either because this is just a dream or because they know what were about to do
43022,okay okay
43023,me im going to blow up the tardis
43024,notice how helpful the dream lord was okay there was misinformation red herrings malice and i could have done without the limerick but he was always very keen to make us choose between dream and reality
43025,yes it is
43026,star burning cold do me a favour the dream lord has no power over the real world he was offering us a choice between two dreams
43027,because i know who he is
43028,a speck of psychic pollen from the candle meadows of karass don slava must have been hanging around for ages fell in the time rotor heated up and induced a dream state for all of us
43029,no no no sorry wasnt it obvious the dream lord was me psychic pollen its a mind parasite it feeds on everything dark in you gives it a voice turns it against you im nine hundred and seven it had a lot to go on
43030,the darkness in you pair it wouldve starved to death in an instant i choose my friends with great care otherwise im stuck with my own company and you know how that works out
43031,amy right now a question is about to occur to rory and seeing as the answer is about to change his life i think you should give him your full attention
43032,there it is
43033,so well then where now or should i just pop down to the swimming pool for a few lengths
43034,behold rio
43035,no ooo feel that though whats that
43036,blue grass patches of it all around the graveyard so earth 2020ish ten years in your future wrong continent for rio ill admit but its not a massive overshoot
43037,cant be
43038,it is its you two
43039,ten years in your future come to relive past glories id imagine humans youre so nostalgic
43040,er no best not really best not these things get complicated very quickly and oh look big mining thing oh i love a big mining thing see way better than rio rio doesnt have a big mining thing
43041,lets go and have a look come on you two lets see what theyre doing
43042,restricted access no unauthorised personnel hmm
43043,what did i break sonicking and entering totally different
43044,youre sure roryll catch us up
43045,the ground doesnt feel like it should
43046,good thought but no it doesnt hear that drill in startup mode afterwaves of a recent seismological shift and blue grass
43047,no thats recent whats in
43048,ministry of drills earth and science new ministry quite big just merged its lot of responsibility on our shoulders dont like to talk about it what are you doing
43049,where are you getting these readings from
43050,whys there a big patch of earth in the middle of your floor
43051,good right you all need to get out of here very fast
43052,whats your name
43053,look at the screens nasreen look at your readings its moving
43054,shouldnt think so its shifting when it shouldnt be shifting
43055,the ground the soil the earth moving but how why
43056,doubt it because its only happening under this room
43057,under the circumstances id suggest run
43058,stay back amy stay away from the earth
43059,amy
43060,stay away from it
43061,ive got you
43062,never
43063,stay calm keep hold of my hand dont let go your drill shut it down go now
43064,amy try and stay calm if you struggle itll make things worse keep hold of my hand
43065,stay calm now hold on till they can just shut down the drill
43066,amy concentrate dont you give up
43067,no amy amy no
43068,shes gone the ground took her
43069,its not quicksand she didnt just sink something pulled her in it wanted her
43070,you said the ground was dormant just a patch of earth when you first saw it this morning and the drill had been stopped
43071,but when you restarted the drill the ground fought back
43072,im not saying that and its not ridiculous i just dont think its right oh of course its bioprogramming
43073,bioprogramming oh its clever you use biosignals to resonate the internal molecular structure of natural objects its mainly used in engineering and construction mostly jungle planets but thats way in the future and not here whats it doing here
43074,excuse me im making perfect sense youre just not keeping up the earth the ground beneath our feet was bioprogrammed to attack
43075,stop you drilling okay so we find whatevers doing the bioprogramming we can find amy we can get her back shush shush shush have i gone mad ive gone mad
43076,shush shush silence absolute silence youve stopped the drill right
43077,and youve only got the one drill
43078,youre sure about that
43079,so if you shut the drill down why can i still hear drilling its under the ground
43080,hacking into your records probe reports samples sensors good just unite the data make it all one big conversation lets have a look so we are here and this is your drill hole twenty one point zero zero nine kilometres well done
43081,why here though whyd you drill on this site  nasreen we found patches of grass in this area containing trace minerals unseen in this country for twenty million years
43082,you only saw what you went looking for  nasreen what are they
43083,grab this equipment and follow me
43084,that noise isnt a drill its transport three of them thirty kilometres down rate of speed looks about a hundred and fifty kilometres an hour should be here in ooo quite soon twelve minutes whatever bioprogrammed the earth is on its way up now
43085,you saw the readings
43086,no no no
43087,not now rory energy barricade invisible to the naked eye we cant get out and no one from the outside world can get in
43088,er no those energy patterns would play havoc with the circuits with a bit of time maybe but weve only got nine and a half minutes
43089,get everyone inside the church rory ill get her back
43090,she was taken into the earth
43091,i tried i promise i tried
43092,ill find amy ill keep you all safe i promise come on please i need you alongside me
43093,yes if we move quickly enough we can be ready
43094,me
43095,yes but i need you to trust me and do exactly as i say from this second onwards because were running out of time
43096,thank you we have eight minutes to set up a line of defence bring me every phone every camera every piece of recording or transmitting equipment you can find
43097,oh thats all right i cant make a decent meringue draw like your life depends on it elliot
43098,good lad
43099,resources every little helps meals on wheels whatve you got here then warmer in the front refrigerated in the back
43100,what are those
43101,no no weapons its not the way i do things
43102,oh ambrose youre better than this im asking nicely put them away
43103,two phase plan first the sensors and cameras will tell us when something arrives second if something does arrive i use this to send a sonic pulse through that network of devices a pulse which would temporarily incapacitate most things in the universe
43104,lovely place to grow up round here
43105,i was the same where i grew up
43106,yeah
43107,so much
43108,yeah
43109,no theyre scared of me
43110,no question
43111,shutting out light from within the barricade trying to isolate us in the dark which means
43112,any time you want to help
43113,it doesnt do wood
43114,oi dont diss the sonic
43115,its deliberate
43116,nothing weve got nothing they sent an energy surge to wreck our systems
43117,its coming through the final layer of earth
43118,i did
43119,he said he was going to get headphones
43120,ambrose dont go running off
43121,what happened
43122,get him into the church now
43123,i dont think so theyve taken three people when they couldve just killed them up here theres still hope ambrose there is always hope
43124,i dont know ill find elliot i promise but first ive got to stop this attack please get inside the church
43125,cold blood i know who they are
43126,defending the planet with meals on wheels
43127,sounds like theyre leaving
43128,i dont think so now both sides have hostages
43129,so i think ive met these creatures before different branch of the species mind but all the same lets see if our friends thawed out
43130,venom gland takes at least twenty four hours to recharge am i right i know what im doing ill be fine
43131,really no last of the species the klempari defence as an interrogation defence its a bit old hat im afraid
43132,no youre really not because im the last of my species and i know how it sits in a heart so dont insult me lets start again tell me your name
43133,how long has your tribe been sleeping under the earth alaya its not difficult to work out youre three hundred million years out of your comfort zone question is what woke you now
43134,the drill
43135,do we have to say vermin theyre really very nice
43136,extraordinary species you attack them theyll fight back but theres a peace to be brokered here i can help you with that
43137,doesnt give you automatic rights to it now im afraid humans wont give up the planet
43138,you underestimate them
43139,one tribe of homo reptilia against six billion humans youve got your work cut out
43140,tell me where my friend is give us back the people who were taken
43141,im not going let you provoke a war alaya therell be no battle here today
43142,not while im here
43143,im going to go down below the surface to find the rest of the tribe to talk to them
43144,theyre not aliens theyre earthliens once known as the silurian race or some would argue eocenes or homo reptilia not monsters not evil well only as evil as you are the previous owners of the planet thats all look from their point of view youre the invaders your drill was threatening their settlement now the creature in the crypt her names alaya shes one of their warriors and shes my best bargaining chip i need her alive if she lives so do elliot and mo and amy because i will find them while im gone you four people in this church in this corner of planet earth you have to be the best of humanity
43145,no dissecting no examining we return their hostage they return ours nobody gets harmed we can land this together if you are the best you can be you are decent brilliant people nobody dies today understand
43146,sort of but youre not coming with me
43147,i dont have time to argue
43148,itll be dangerous
43149,oh for goodness sake all right then come on
43150,welcome aboard the tardis now dont touch anything very precious
43151,everything im hoping if were going down that barricade wont interfere
43152,im not doing anything weve been hijacked i cant stop it they mustve sensed the electromagnetic field theyre pulling the tardis down into the earth
43153,looks like we fell through the bottom of their tunnel system dont suppose it was designed for handling something like this
43154,oh a lot more than twenty one kilometres
43155,dont know interesting isnt it
43156,not every day every other day
43157,were looking for a small tribal settlement probably housing around a dozen homo reptilia maybe less
43158,yeah  nasreen maybe a dozen
43159,must be getting closer to the centre of the city
43160,front door approach definitely always the best way
43161,apart from the back door approach thats also good sometimes better
43162,were not hostile were not armed were here in peace
43163,argh
43164,decontamination no no no
43165,im not an ape look at the scans two hearts totally different totally not ape remove all human germs you remove half the things keeping me alive
43166,oh thats much better thanks not got any celery have you no no not really the climate tomatoes though youd do a roaring trade in those im the doctor oh and theres nasreen good
43167,hello who are you
43168,oh dear really theres always a military isnt there
43169,oxygen pockets lovely ooo but not so good with an impending drill now it makes sense
43170,invasion force me and lovely nasreen no we came for the humans you took and to offer the safe return of alaya oh wait you and she what is it same genetic source of course youre worried but dont be shes safe
43171,wait wait we all want the same thing here
43172,whats that
43173,yes
43174,these must be the only ones awake the others must still be in hibernation
43175,their astronomers predicted the planet heading to earth on a crash course they a built life underground and put themselves to sleep for millennia in order to avert what they thought was the apocalypse when in reality it was the moon coming into alignment with the earth
43176,long time ago i met another tribe of homo reptilia similar but not identical
43177,the humans attacked them they died im sorry   targetblankdoctor who and the silurians
43178,oh lovely place very gleaming
43179,amy pond theres a girl to rely on
43180,dont you touch her
43181,im glad youre okay
43182,homo reptilia they occupied the planet before humans now they want it back
43183,let rory deal with this ambrose eh
43184,theres no need for this  rory
43185,dont do this
43186,id say youve got a fair bit to talk about
43187,you both want the planet you both have a genuine claim to it
43188,me no but they are
43189,course you are amy pond and nasreen chaudhry speaking for the planet humanity couldnt have better ambassadors come on who has more fun than us
43190,oh nasreen sorry probably worth mentioning at this stage amy and i travel in time a bit
43191,there are fixed points through time where things must always stay the way they are this is not one of them this is an opportunity a temporal tipping point whatever happens today will change future events create its own timeline its own reality the future pivots around you here now so do good for humanity and for earth
43192,come on be extraordinary
43193,okay bringing things to order the first meeting of representatives of the human race and homo reptilia is now in session ha never said that before thats fab carry on now mo lets go and get your son oh you know humans and their predecessors shooting the breeze never thought id see it
43194,but why
43195,youve been down here working by yourself all alone
43196,malohkeh i rather love you
43197,elliot im sorry i took my eye off you
43198,not bad for a first session more similarities than differences
43199,here they are
43200,somethings wrong
43201,no dont do this tell me you didnt do this
43202,im sorry i didnt know you have to believe me theyre better than this
43203,we had a chance here
43204,in future when you talk about this you tell people there was a chance but you were so much less than the best of humanity
43205,one woman she was scared for her family she is not typical
43206,one person let us down but there is a whole race of dazzling peaceful human beings up there you were building something here come on an alliance could work
43207,why
43208,dont do this dont call their bluff
43209,no
43210,this is a deadly weapon stay back
43211,ah ah stop right there or ill use my very deadly weapon again one warning thats all you get if there can be no deal you go back into hibernation all of you now this ends here
43212,like i said one warning
43213,tony mack sweaty forehead dilated pupils what are you hiding
43214,youre not dying youre mutating
43215,decontamination program might work dont know eldane can you run the program on tony
43216,so question is how we do stop the drill given we cant get there in time plus also how do we get out given that were surrounded nasreen how do you feel about an energy pulse channelled up through the tunnels to the base of the drill

43308,and one im pretty sure youll rise to but moving on theres something i need to show you
43309,this is a creature called the krafayis they travel in space they travel as a pack scavenging across the universe and sometimes one of them gets left behind and because they are a brutal race the others never come back so dotted all around the universe are individual utterly merciless utterly abandoned krafayis and what they do is well kill until theyre killed which they usually arent because other creatures cant see them
43310,yes and thats why we are in a unique position today my friend to end this reign of terror so feeling like painting the church today
43311,take my word for it if you paint it he will come
43312,in your own time and i promise you well be out of your hair by this time tomorrow
43313,well think about it this is the middle of vincent van goghs greatest year of painting if were not careful the net result of our pleasant little trip will be the brutal murder of the greatest artist who ever lived half the pictures on the wall of the muse� dorsay will disappear and it will be our fault
43314,my experience is that there is you know surprisingly always hope
43315,come on come out come on lets go outside
43316,very well ill leave ill leave you
43317,come on we have to do this on our own go to the church at the right time and hope the monster still turns up
43318,okay okay so now we must have a plan when the creature returns
43319,well yes tick but last night we were lucky amy could have been killed so this time for a start we have to make sure i can see him too
43320,the answers in this box i had an excellent if smelly godmother
43321,no its a thing its like a plan but with more greatness
43322,no quite and to be honest im not sure about mad either it seems to me depression is a very complex
43323,well yes paint do painting i remember watching michelangelo painting the sistine chapel wow what a whinger i kept saying to him look if youre scared of heights you shouldnt have taken the job then
43324,and picasso what a ghastly old goat i kept telling him concentrate pablo its one eye either side of the face
43325,is this how time normally passes really slowly in the right order if theres one thing i cant stand its an unpunctual alien attack
43326,yes theres something not right and i cant quite put my finger on it
43327,where
43328,as i thought come on im going in
43329,no youre vincent van gogh no
43330,i am
43331,overconfidence this and a small screwdriver im absolutely sorted just have to find the right crosactic setting and stun him with it sonic never fails anyway amy only one thought one simple instruction dont follow me under any circumstances
43332,argh i thought i told you never mind well talk about it later quick in here
43333,shush
43334,doing anything
43335,anything
43336,ooo
43337,this is no good at all run like crazy and regroup
43338,right okay heres the plan amy rory
43339,sorry er vincent
43340,i dont know actually my only definite plan is that in future im definitely just using this screwdriver for screwing in screws
43341,i suppose we could try talking to him
43342,well yes might be interesting to know his side of the story yes though maybe hes not really in the mood for conversation right at this precise moment
43343,whats it up to now
43344,what
43345,i am really stupid
43346,vincent vincent whats happening
43347,hes trying to say something
43348,im having trouble making it out but i think hes saying im afraid im afraid there there shush shush its okay its okay youll be fine shush
43349,sometimes winning winning is no fun at all
43350,ive seen many things my friend but youre right nothing quite as wonderful as the things you see
43351,oh no no no i could never accept such an extraordinary gift
43352,well no youre not thinking exactly what im thinking vincent ive got something id like to show you maybe just tidy yourself up a bit first
43353,well brace yourself vinny    vincent
43354,thats a friction contrafibulator
43355,thats ketchup and that ones mustard
43356,good idea although actually theres a little something id like to show you first

43358,doctor black we met a few days ago i asked you about the church at auvers
43359,yes and today is another cracker if i may say so but i just wondered between you and me in a hundred words where do you think van gogh rates in the history of art
43360,vincent im sorry im sorry is it too much
43361,its been a great adventure and a great honour
43362,im delighted i wont ever forget you
43363,im not sure there will     black
43364,i wouldnt say that the way i see it every life is a pile of good things and bad things hey the good things dont always soften the bad things but vice versa the bad things dont necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant and we definitely added to his pile of good things and if you look carefully maybe we did indeed make a couple of little changes
43365,no krafayis

43522,whats this
43523,does it have a title
43524,and its a fairy tale a legend it cant be real
43525,no but if you buried the most dangerous thing in the universe youd want to remember where you put it
43526,if the pandorica is here it contains the mightiest warrior in history now half the galaxy would want a piece of that maybe even fight over it we need to get down there
43527,the underhenge
43528,there was a goblin or a trickster or a warrior a nameless terrible thing soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies the most feared being in all the cosmos and nothing could stop it or hold it or reason with it one day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world
43529,you know fairy tales a good wizard tricked it
43530,sorry what
43531,your favourite school topic your favourite story never ignore a coincidence unless youre busy in which case always ignore a coincidence

43557,im sorry
43558,no no no thats er a memory a friend of mine someone i lost do you mind
43559,people fall out of the world sometimes but they always leave traces little things we cant quite account for faces in photographs luggage half eaten meals rings nothing is ever forgotten not completely and if something can be remembered it can come back
43560,remember that night you flew away with me
43561,and you asked me why i was taking you and i told you there wasnt a reason i was lying

43622,rory listen shes not dead well she is dead but its not the end of the world well it is the end of the world actually its the end of the universe oh no hang on
43623,you need to get me out of the pandorica
43624,yes i am well im not now but i was back then well back now from your point of view which is back then from my point of view time travel you cant keep it straight in your head its easy to open from the outside just point and press
43625,how did you do that
43626,no i didnt
43627,temporal energy same screwdriver at different points in its own time stream which means it was me who gave it to you me from the future ive got a future thats nice thats not
43628,history has collapsed whole races have been deleted from existence these are just like afterimages echoes fossils in time the footprints of the neverwere
43629,total event collapse the universe literally never happened
43630,nothing eye of the storm thats all were just the last light to go out amy wheres amy
43631,youre a nestene duplicate a lump of plastic with delusions of humanity
43632,thats software talking
43633,yeah probably if i had the time
43634,all of creation has just been wiped from the sky do you know how many lives now never happened all the people who never lived your girlfriend isnt more important than the whole universe
43635,welcome back rory williams sorry had to be sure hell of a gunarm youre packing there right we need to get her downstairs and take that look off your plastic face youre getting married in the morning
43636,bit of a plan yeah memories are more powerful than you think and amy pond is not an ordinary girl grew up with a time crack in her wall the universe pouring through her dreams every night the nestenes took a memory print of her and got a bit more than they bargained for like you not just your face but your heart and your soul
43637,im saving her this box is the ultimate prison you cant even escape by dying it forces you to stay alive
43638,well shes mostly dead the pandorica can stasislock her that way now all it needs is a scan of her living dna and itll restore her
43639,in about two thousand years
43640,hes in here left a message in my head like im an answerphone where am i hang on national museum right i was here once when i was a little
43641,yeah but were taking a shortcut rivers vortex manipulator rubbish way to time travel but the universe is tiny now well be fine
43642,a version of it not quite the one you know earth alone in the sky lets go and have a look you put your hand there dont worry should be safe
43643,shell be fine nothing can get into this box
43644,well theres only one of me i counted
43645,no rory no dont even think about it
43646,she wont feel it
43647,two thousand years rory you wont even sleep youd be conscious every second it would drive you mad
43648,rory you
43649,yes obviously
43650,why do you have to be so human
43651,listen to me this is the last bit of advice youre going to get in a very long time youre living plastic but youre not immortal i have no idea how long youll last and youre not indestructible stay away from heat and radio signals when they come along you cant heal or repair yourself any damage is permanent so for gods sake however bored you get stay out of    narrator
43652,trouble oh ah two of you complicated
43653,come along ponds
43654,well we are running into a dead end where ill have a brilliant plan that basically involves not being in one
43655,get out of here go just run
43656,its not a weapon scan it its not a weapon and you dont have the power to waste
43657,yeah shut up because weve got to go come on
43658,and break and breathe well somebody didnt get out much for two thousand years
43659,oh its all mouths today isnt it the light the light from the pandorica it must have hit the dalek
43660,oh how
43661,ah well no time to lose then
43662,yes i am well im not now but i was back then
43663,vortex manipulator cheap and nasty time travel very bad for you im trying to give it up
43664,the roof
43665,yeah its me me from the future
43666,what dead yes yes of course hes dead right ive got twelve minutes thats good
43667,oh you can do loads in twelve minutes suck a mint buy a sledge have a fast bath come on the roof
43668,oh good are you in charge now so tell me what are we going to do about amelia
43669,there is no amelia from now on there never was history is still collapsing
43670,youre an anomaly we all are were all just hanging on at the eye of the storm but the eye is closing and if we dont do something fast reality will never have happened today just dying is a result now come on
43671,history is shrinking is anybody listening to me the universe is collapsing we dont have much time left
43672,looking for the tardis
43673,okay then im looking for an exploding tardis
43674,good question for another day the question for now is total event collapse means that every star in the universe never happened not one single one of them ever shone so if all the stars that ever were are gone then what is that
43675,is it well heres the noise that sun is making right now
43676,no its not of course the emergency protocols the tardis has sealed off the control room and put her into a time loop to save her she is right at the heart of the explosion  river
43677,hi honey im home
43678,its okay hes on our side
43679,yeah
43680,its a fez i wear a fez now fezes are cool
43681,run run move move go
43682,shush its moving away finding another way in it needs to restore its power before it can attack again now that means weve got exactly four and a half minutes before its at lethal capacity
43683,because thats when its due to kill me
43684,oh shut up never mind how can that dalek even exist it was erased from time and then it came back
43685,its not a light its a restoration field but never mind call it a light that light brought amy back restored her but how could it bring back a dalek when the daleks have never existed
43686,when the tardis blew up it caused a total event collapse a time explosion and that explosion blasted every atom in every moment of the universe except
43687,the perfect prison and inside it perfectly preserved a few billion atoms of the universe as it was in theory you could extrapolate the whole universe from a single one of them like like cloning a body from a single cell and weve got the bumper family pack
43688,the box contains a memory of the universe and the light transmits the memory and thats how were going to do it
43689,relight the fire reboot the universe come on
43690,what if we give it a moment of infinite power what if we can transmit the light from the pandorica to every particle of space and time simultaneously
43691,ah no you see its not its almost completely impossible one spark is all we need
43692,big bang two now listen
43693,big bang two
43694,amy pond the girl who waited all night in your garden was it worth it
43695,you asked me why i was taking you with me and i said no reason i was lying

43761,time isnt a straight line its all bumpy wumpy theres loads of boring stuff like sundays and tuesdays and thursday afternoons but now and then there are saturdays big temporal tipping points when anythings possible the tardis cant resist them like a moth to a flame she loves a party so i give her 1969 and nasa because thats space in the sixties and canton everett delaware the third and this is where shes pointing

43790,thanks canton
43791,not so thanks
43792,im going to need a swat team ready to mobilise street level maps covering all of florida a pot of coffee twelve jammie dodgers and a fez
43793,theres where nasa is she mentioned a spaceman nasas where the spacemen live also theres another lead im following
43794,are you all right
43795,here the only place in the united states that call could be coming from see obvious when you think about it
43796,its a hobby
43797,theres no time for a swat team lets go mister president tell her helps on the way canton on no account follow me into this box and close the door behind you
43798,jefferson isnt a girls name its not her name either jefferson adams hamilton river
43799,lovely fellows two of them fancied me
43800,you see the president asked the child two questions where are you and who are you she was answering where
43801,now where would you find three big historical names in a row like that
43802,here come on
43803,are you taking care of this
43804,about five miles from cape kennedy space centre its 1969 the year of the moon interesting dont you think
43805,i dont know lost me a bit the president asked the girl where she was and she did what any lost little girl would do she looked out of the window
43806,the only place in florida probably all of america with those three street names on the same junction and doctor song youve got that face on again
43807,the hes hot when hes clever face

43809,not a chance
43810,you havent even got to space travel yet
43811,brave heart canton come on
43812,you realise this is almost certainly a trap of course
43813,lets see if anyone tries to kill us and work backwards
43814,i dont know lets find her and ask her
43815,which is odd because look at this
43816,its very contemporary cutting edge this is from the space program
43817,apparently
43818,maybe because its cooler look how cool this stuff is
43819,well what would you call me
43820,oi
43821,ah back with us canton
43822,thats my boy so come on little girl lets find her
43823,so where does that go
43824,life signs
43825,those are the worst kind
43826,shout if you get in trouble
43827,er nothing shes just a friend
43828,okay
43829,stupidly dangerous
43830,rory would you mind going with her
43831,then id appreciate it all the more
43832,amy  girl
43833,what now
43834,just unconscious got a proper whack
43835,not a great moment
43836,what are you doing
43837,no    ltback to the episode listing
43838,canton amy amy
43839,run
43840,look behind you
43841,look look canton look i tell you
43842,why dont you ask her
43843,these bricks what are they made of where is she
43844,id say zero balance dwarf star alloy the densest material in the universe nothing gets through that youre building me the perfect prison and it still wont be enough
43845,is there a reason youre doing this
43846,in a cell
43847,good work canton door sealed
43848,are you okay
43849,exactly whatever they might think were doing in here they know were not going anywhere
43850,dont worry she does that amy rory open all the doors to the swimming pool
43851,no idea but the good news is weve got a secret weapon
43852,no no its not apollo 11 that would be silly its neil armstrongs foot      radio
43853,ha so three months what have we found out
43854,not just america the entire world
43855,are you okay
43856,better
43857,as long as theres been something in the corner of your eye or creaking in your house or breathing under your bed or voices through a wall theyve been running your lives for a very long time now so keep this straight in your head we are not fighting an alien invasion were leading a revolution and today the battle begins
43858,like this
43859,nanorecorder fuses with the cartilage in your hand  ow and it tunes itself directly to the speech centres in your brain itll pick up your voice no matter what telepathic connection so the moment you see one of the creatures you activate it and describe aloud exactly what youre seeing
43860,i did but even information about these creatures erases itself over time i couldnt refresh it because i couldnt talk to you
43861,what does it mean if the lights flashing what did i just tell you
43862,play it  canton
43863,no neither can i you straightened my bow tie because i planted the idea in your head while you were looking at the creature
43864,now then a little girl in a spacesuit they got the suit from nasa but where did they get the girl
43865,except theyd probably stay close to that warehouse because why bother doing anything else and theyd take her from somewhere that would cause the least amount of attention but youll have to find her im off to nasa
43866,childrens homes
43867,repeated memory wipes fry your head eventually find out what you can but dont hang around
43868,dont worry ive put everything back the way i found it except this theres always a bit left over isnt there        amy
43869,i told you im on a top secret mission for the president
43870,i sent him a message
43871,sorry
43872,thank you bye bye
43873,you have to tape everything that happens in this office every word or you wont know if youre under the influence
43874,thing a clever thing now no more questions you have to trust me and nobody else
43875,okay gun down ive got it
43876,er it defaults to live this is current wherever she is right now this is what shes saying
43877,she cant hear you im so sorry its one way
43878,okay who and what are you
43879,who was she why put her in here
43880,including the telephone network
43881,but why phone the president
43882,purchased on earth perfectly ordinary stationery tardis blue summoned by a stranger who wont even show his face thats a first for me how about you
43883,thats not really what i asked
43884,what are the silence doing raising a child
43885,the only way to save amy is to work out what the silence are doing
43886,and every single thing we learn about them brings us a step closer
43887,of course its possible shes not just any little girl
43888,but
43889,incredibly strong and running away i like her
43890,yes i know but how anyway i have the strangest feeling shes going to find us
43891,because thats what the silence do think about it they dont make anything themselves they dont have to they get other life forms to do it for them
43892,superparasites standing in the shadows of human history since the very beginning we know they can influence human behaviour any way they want if theyve been doing that on a global scale for thousands of years
43893,then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the moon
43894,because the silence needed a spacesuit
43895,why
43896,shell be safe for now no point in a dead hostage
43897,i can track that signal back take us right to her
43898,because then what i find her and then what do i do this isnt an alien invasion they live here this is their empire this is kicking the romans out of rome
43899,i know i was there
43900,personal question
43901,do you ever remember it two thousand years waiting for amy the last centurion
43902,youre lying
43903,of course you are not the sort of thing anyone forgets
43904,oh interesting very aickman road ive seen one of these before abandoned i wonder how that happened oh well i suppose im about to find out rory river keep one silent in eyeshot at all times oh hello sorry you were in the middle of something i just had to say though have you seen whats on the telly oh hello amy are you all right want to watch some television ah now stay where you are because look at me im confident you want to watch that me when im confident oh and this is my friend river nice hair clever has her own gun and unlike me she really doesnt mind shooting people i shouldnt like that kind of do a bit
43905,i know youre team players and everything but shell definitely kill at least the first three of you
43906,seven really
43907,stop it
43908,yeah well maybe i will
43909,yes right sorry as i was saying my naughty friend here is going to kill the first three of you to attack plus him behind so maybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz
43910,or maybe you could just listen a minute because all i really want to do is accept your total surrender and then ill let you go in peace yes youve been interfering in human history for thousands of years yes people have suffered and died but whats the point in two hearts if you cant be a bit forgiving now and then ooo the silence you guys take that seriously dont you okay you got me im lying im not really going to let you go that easily nice thought but its not christmas first you tell me about the girl who is she why is she important whats she for  mccandless
43911,oh but dont forget this bit ready          silence
43912,dont let them build to full power
43913,helping
43914,thats really rude
43915,safe no of course youre not safe theres about a billion other things out there just waiting to burn your whole world but if you want to pretend youre safe just so you can sleep at night okay youre safe but youre not really canton until the next one eh
43916,canton just wants to get married hell of a reason to kick him out of the fbi
43917,im counting on you
43918,i should warn you i dont answer a lot of questions
43919,oh dicky tricky dicky theyre never going to forget you say hi to david frost for me
43920,okay up to you see you next time call me
43921,have i forgotten something
43922,right okay interesting
43923,we havent
43924,oh look at the time must be off but it was very nice it was it was good it was er unexpected you know what they say theres a first time for everything
43925,rory im going to need thermocouplings the green ones and blue ones
43926,so
43927,youre okay
43928,after effect of the silence natural enough thats not what i was asking you told me you were pregnant
43929,why
43930,no why did you tell me

44685,amy pond i am going to put this right you said you learned from an
44686,sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment but temporal engines
44687,oh very very ah    doctor
44688,ive worked out how to hijack the temporal engines and use them to fold two points of amys timeline together were bringing her out of the then and into the now amy i just need to borrow your brain a minute it wont hurt probably almost probably and then    doctor
44689,we could take this amy with us easy but if we do our amy has to wait thirty six years to be rescued
44690,that is not how i travel       doctor
44691,yes except sometimes knowing your own futures what enables you to change it especially if youre bloody minded contradictory
44692,its your marriage
44693,perhaps maybe if i shunted the reality compensators on the tardis recalibrated the doomsday bumpers and jettisoned the karaoke bar yes maybe yes it could do it the tardis could sustain the paradox
44694,okay amy past amy stand by the door future amy you too    doctor
44695,hold it in your head and do not let it go lever one
44696,rory rory take the glasses off youre getting temporal feedback
44697,ah its just an anaesthetic shell be fine
44698,i lied to her rory there can never be two amys in the tardis the paradox is too massive
44699,no shell never have existed when we save our amy this future wont have happened
44700,no shes not real
44701,look we take this amy we leave ours only one amy in the tardis which one do you want
44702,your choice rory
44703,i promised you id save her and there she is safe
44704,ill leave you two alone
44705,amy beaky this could be the most exciting thing i have ever seen
44706,because assembled ponds this is not earth this has just been made to look like earth the craftsmanship involved can you imagine
44707,i dont know something must have yanked us off course look at the detail on that cheese plant
44708,colonists maybe recreating a bit of home like when expats open english pubs in majorca no whoever did this i am shaking his stroke her hand stroke tentacle
44709,i dont know lets find out
44710,blimey that was a bit quick

44712,ive never been threatened with a chair leg before no hang on i tell a lie
44713,oh youre good oh shes good amy with regret youre fired

44715,you with the face howie you said you were surprised to be back in reception
44716,you clever one whats he talking about
44717,thats quite enough of that
44718,theyre not doors theyre walls walls that look like doors doorwalls if you like or dwalls woors even though youd probably got it when you said theyre not doors i mean the windows are
44719,things hello what kind of things interesting things i love things ask anyone
44720,well that killed the mood how did you get here
44721,ah
44722,so what have we got people snatched from their lives and dropped into an endless shifting maze that looks like a 1980s hotel with bad dreams in the bedrooms
44723,okay this is bad at the moment i dont know how bad but certainly were three buses a long walk and eight quid in a taxi from good are there any more of you
44724,doing what

44731,i think you should come with me
44732,first we find the tardis quick thing before we go if you feel drawn to a particular room do not go in and make sure someone else can see you at all times
44733,something to add joe
44734,hello
44735,hey dont
44736,youre right keep telling yourself that its a cia thing nothing more

44738,come on
44739,amy get back why havent they got us yet
44740,they should have got us by now amy look at me focus on me its your bad dream thats all
44741,im sorry i just have to see what it is i just have to see
44742,he died
44743,no well yes both actually i mean there is no cause all his vital organs simply stopped as if the simple spark of life his loves and hates his faiths and fears were just taken and this is a cup of tea
44744,but how did you make it
44745,which is
44746,youre a muslim
44747,ha you think this is hell
44748,and all these fears and phobias wandering about most are completely unconnected to us so why are they still here
44749,ha i like you youre a right clever clogs but this isnt hell rita
44750,yeah sorry
44751,er my name is lucy hayward and im the last one left it took luke first it got him on his first day almost as soon as we arrived
44752,anything else i just saw mine it was a gorilla from a book id read as a kid my god that thing used to terrify me the gaps between my worships are getting shorter like contractions  lucy
44753,what did you just say
44754,i wont leave you i promise you you have my word on that
44755,hold it
44756,no we stay together
44757,howie howie howie youre next were all dead jealous so tell us how do we get a piece of the action why isnt he possessing all of us
44758,its as i thought it feeds on fear everything the rooms lucys note even the pictures in reception has been put here to frighten us so we have to resist it do whatever you have to cross your fingers say a prayer think of a basket of kittens but do not give in to the fear
44759,were going to catch ourselves a monster     howie
44760,nothing personal i just think we should take things slowly get to know each other you take peoples most primal fears and pop it in a room a tailormade hell just for them why
44761,so what are we cell mates lunch we are not ripe this is what joe said that we werent ready so what what you make us ready you what replace replace what fear you have lived so long even your name is lost you want this to stop because you are just instinct then tell me tell me how to fight you  howie
44762,stay back
44763,whered he go       rita rory are you all right
44764,have you found your room yet
44765,maybe youre not scared of anything
44766,you said that in the past tense
44767,rita brilliant how are you not panicking are you good good because i am literally an otters toenail away from getting us out of here
44768,excellent question excellent question why what
44769,oh yeah and when we get out of this ill show you too
44770,right down to the smallest detail got you mister minotaur
44771,of course who else
44772,rita rita please let me find you  rita
44773,no no no rita  rita
44774,oh no oh no no
44775,its not fear its faith not just religious faith faith in something howard believed in conspiracies that external forces controlled the world joe had dice cufflinks and a chain with a horseshoe he was a gambler gamblers believe in luck an intangible force that helps them win or lose gibbis has rejected any personal autonomy and is waiting for the next batch of invaders to oppress him and tell him what to do they all believe theres something guiding them about to save them thats what it replaces every time someone was confronted with their most primal fear they fell back on their most fundamental faith and all this time i have been telling you to dig deep find the thing that keeps you brave i made you expose your faith show them what they needed
44776,it doesnt want you thats why it kept showing you a way out youre not religious or superstitious so theres no faith for you to fall back on it wants her
44777,your faith in me thats what brought us here
44778,it needs to convert the faith into a form it can consume faith is an energy the specific emotional energy the creature needs to live which is why at the end of her note lucy said
44779,exactly
44780,amy what are you doing
44781,i cant save you from this theres nothing i can do to stop this
44782,i stole your childhood and now ive led you by the hand to your death but the worst thing is i knew i knew this would happen this is what always happens
44783,its both actually yeah here we go
44784,no need for any its all automated it drifts through space snatching people with belief systems and converts their faith into food for the creature
44785,according to the inflight recorder the programme developed glitches it got stuck on the same setting the fears from the people before us werent tidied away
44786,an ancient creature drenched in the blood of the innocent drifting in space through an endless shifting maze for such a creature death would be a gift then accept it and sleep well i wasnt talking about myself
44787,no real earth real house real door keys
44788,you showed me a picture of it once and said this is my favourite car
44789,you havent seen the last of me bad penny is my middle name seriously the looks i get when i fill in a form its
44790,because youre still breathing
44791,i mean youre right theres still heaps of stuff out there to look at do you know theres a planet whose name literally translates as volatile circus or maybe theres a bigger scarier adventure waiting for you in there
44792,and whats the alternative me standing over your grave over your broken body over rorys body

44877,its not a rat its a cybermat
44878,cybermats are infiltrators very small very deadly they collect power like bees collect pollen one of thems been sucking the electrical energy from this area but why a shop you know why not a nuclear power station
44879,lets ask it we wait for the shop to shut we stake the place out and grab ourselves a cybermat
44880,what is
44881,whoa whoa whoa this is not my fault craig
44882,its his nappy hes mentioned it twice
44883,theres a changing station over by electrical goods

44896,yeah i know what i said i say a lot of things but i fused the teleport it should have taken them days to repair
44897,oh i should be dead but the arm it chopped me with it was damaged old spare parts must have changed those missing people
44898,a long story im not exactly compatible but why are they using spare parts why everything i find out makes less sense
44899,weve got a base when did we get a base
44900,no  craig
44901,i think i can find the right frequency shut it down again
44902,all right all right all right move
44903,ah it must be shielded from metastatic energy of course
44904,dont worry i have an app for that stand back stand back
44905,inactive yes technically never been alive it was playing possum before to take us by surprise bravo
44906,and transmitting it up to the cybership but why why do they need power why are those conversions not complete yet and what are they doing up there
44907,no i had to wipe its brain now i can reprogram it and use it as a weapon against them
44908,no after me
44909,after me because of me you and alfie nearly died do you still feel safe with me craig

44915,but where are the silver men
44916,secondary teleport no there is no other teleport they must have had a backup system something complicated something powerful something shielded something like a door a door a disillium bonded steel door disguised as a wall
44917,took me a while lot on my mind lets see this ship crashed here centuries ago no survivors but the systems are dormant waiting for power and then the council stick a load of new cables right on top of you bitey wakes up and channels the power you start crewing up from the shop as best you can not enough power not enough parts
44918,what the six of you

44930,alfie needs you
44931,youve triggered a feedback loop into their emotional inhibitors all that stuff they cut out of themselves now theyre feeling it which means a very big explosion
44932,theyve sealed the ship
44933,i know
44934,that was another review ten out of ten
44935,no thats impossible and also grossly sentimental and over simplistic you destroyed them because of the deeply ingrained hereditary human trait to protect ones own genes which in turn triggered a a a yeah love you blew them up with love
44936,i dont know shush
44937,thank you for your help val good noticing keep them peeled

45240,well it is quite ridiculous also brilliant thats why the system teleported us here i wanted the engines this is the engine room hydrogenerators ha
45241,fabulously impossible oh think of the things we could learn from this ship if we manage to stop it being blown to pieces
45242,bad news cant shut the wave system down in time takes takes way too long
45243,exactly thats what we need to find now what do we do about the things that arent kestrals

45275,im a sagittarius probably
45276,a commerce colony youre a trader
45277,ah the purple light thats what it was an iv system identifying value the database of everything across space and time allocated a market value argos for the universe you were trying to find out how much im worth
45278,thats me worthless unlike these creatures you have on board very valuable given theyre extinct done sit up very slowly
45279,i need to take this
45280,be ready
45281,what did you do to the silurians
45282,because you wanted the dinosaurs
45283,piracy and then genocide
45284,oh im a very emotive man
45285,the creatures on board this ship are not objects to be sold or traded
45286,you said roxborne peninsula so why are you heading to earth youre on the wrong course oh you dont know how brilliant you couldnt change the preprogrammed course without instructions the ship defaulted returned home oh dear the silurians outwitted you even after youd massacred them so now youre a prisoner on the ship you hijacked
45287,little bit of news solomon youre being targeted by missiles get off this ship while you still can
45288,dont ever judge me by your standards
45289,just do exactly as i do
45290,geronimo
45291,go tricy run like the wind    robot 1
45292,go tricy  robot 1

45294,come on tricy where are the brakes
45295,computer show us weapons and defence systems
45296,ah theyre ancient species rory still full of hope
45297,its too late it wont make any difference
45298,it wont work rory the missiles are locked on
45299,i dont know i dont know
45300,you wont get your precious cargo on board though just be you and your metal tantrum machines  robot 1
45301,i dont know what youre talking about

45304,no
45305,no no no no no way

45307,no no debts you dont owe me anything
45308,no neffy neffy
45309,bingo
45310,okay control deck
45311,come on the missiles are locked onto us we cant outrun them we have to save the dinosaurs and get nefertiti back from solomon isnt it obvious
45312,seventeen minutes before the missiles hit we need to turn this ship around
45313,ah yes but i didnt have this plan then did i riddell keep an eye out for dinosaurs
45314,no killing any rory brian get rid of the cobwebs
45315,parallel pilot compartments both configured needs two operator of the same genechain and thats why solomon couldnt change the ships course and neither can we
45316,brian pond you are delicious
45317,course you are sit down both of you licketty split the ship does all the engineering the controls are straight forward even a monkey use them oh look theyre going to guys come on comedy gold wheres a silurian audience when you need one anyway two eye line screens velocity and trajectories steer away from the earth try not to bump into the moon otherwise the races who live there will be livid
45318,primary controls in the arms of the chairs principles the same as any vehicle eight minutes forty five seconds
45319,humans you are so linear shine the torch in here
45320,mixing my messages hows the job
45321,i work best when im multitasking keep talking hows the job

45326,dont
45327,ships still magnetised just couldnt bear to lose you
45328,dont mess with egyptian queens solomon i hope youve learnt that now
45329,disabling this ships signal and replacing it with the one from the silurian ship i send this craft off emitting the signal theyre looking for the missiles will follow hopefully siliurian ship safe dinosaurs safe everybody safe bit tight for time though shouldnt really be chatting neffy lets go how remiss of me almost forgot the thing about missiles very literal this is what they latch on to
45330,did the silurians beg you to stop look solomon the missiles see them shine see how valuable they are and theyre all yours
45331,enjoy your bounty
45332,oh fine of course
45333,right yes im pretty busy anyway i mean ive got to drop everyone back
45334,mercy eighty one residents
45335,a load of stones and lumps of wood
45336,i see keep out signs as suggestions more than actual orders like dry clean only
45337,an electric street lamp about ten years too early
45338,thats what you said when you left your phone charger in henry the eighths ensuite
45339,anachronistic electricity keep out signs aggressive stares has someone been peeking at my christmas list
45340,tea but the strong stuff leave the bag in
45341,son you can stay
45342,of course im the doctor this is
45343,well er bit personal its all relative isnt it i mean i think youre the aliens but in this context yes yes i suppose i am
45344,rory everything is completely under control guys guys guys
45345,what happens if someone crosses the line
45346,he shoots peoples hats
45347,ah no yes i see hmm
45348,well thats what happens when people get toast crumbs on the console anyway i think its about time i met him dont you
45349,the chap outside said i could be the alien doctor but you said i wasnt so you already know who it is two alien doctors were like buses resident eighty one i presume so beloved by the townsfolk he warranted an alteration to the sign probably because he rigged up these electrics and im guessing hes in here because if half the town suddenly wanted to throw me to my death this is where id want to be
45350,the kahler i love the kahler theyre one of the most ingenious races in the galaxy seriously they could build a spaceship out of tupperware and moss
45351,and you stayed as their doctor
45352,so why does the gunslinger want you
45353,im just saying if we knew that
45354,did you try to repair your craft surely someone with your skills
45355,we evacuate the town our ships just over the hills room for everyone ill pop out bring it back here roberts your uncle
45356,ive matured im twelve hundred years old now plus i dont want to miss the archers
45357,why would i be curious its a mysterious space cowboy assassin curious of course im not curious
45358,with a little sleight of hand
45359,can i borrow your horse please its official marshal business
45360,no he isnt i speak horse hes called susan and he wants you to respect his life choices
45361,whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa yes i know were in a hurry i just want to check something out two ticks
45362,this is an awful lot of security for a titchy spacecraft
45363,tell me everything you can about the gunslinger
45364,personal files of doctor kahlerjex    jex
45365,dont shoot dont shoot dont shoot i know who you are and who jex is too
45366,you want justice you deserve justice but this isnt the way we can put him on trial
45367,hes lying every word every thing he says its all lies this man is a murderer
45368,sit down sit down tell them what you are
45369,the gunslinger is a cyborg
45370,half man half machine a weapon jex built it he and his team took volunteers told them theyd been selected for special training then experimented on them fused their bodies with weaponry and programmed them to kill
45371,and how many died screaming on the operating table before you had found your advantage
45372,hmm yes i dont know whatever amy said
45373,no no but these people are out out out
45374,go on
45375,i genuinely dont know
45376,or what you wont shoot me amy
45377,we can end this right now we could save everyone right now
45378,jex has to answer for his crimes
45379,but they coming back dont you see every time i negotiate i try to understand well not today no today i honour the victims first his the masters the daleks all the people who died because of my mercy
45380,amelia pond fine fine we think of something else but frankly im betting on the gunslinger
45381,isaac isaac isaac its okay its okay we can get you to jexs surgery he can save you
45382,it wont come to that isaac
45383,take jex to his cell if anything happens to him youll have me to answer to
45384,yeah and youre the deputy
45385,why whats wrong
45386,whats going on
45387,i promised isaac id protect him
45388,you know i cant do that
45389,please dont do this
45390,oh certainly not but this lynch mobs a town turning against itself this is everything isaac didnt want
45391,thats eighteen then too young to have fought in the war so im guessing youve never shot anyone before have you
45392,but thats how all this started jex turned someone into a weapon now that same storys going to make you a killer too dont you see violence doesnt end violence it extends it and i dont think you want to do this i dont think you want to become that man
45393,i know who i can save if youll let me
45394,dont know but you are
45395,thank you
45396,but i cant can i because then isaacs death would mean nothing just another casualty in your endless bloody war do you want me to hand you over is that what you want do you even know
45397,oh i know exactly what you are and i see this reformation for what it really is you committed an atrocity and chose this as your punishment dont get me wrong good choice civilised hours lots of adulation nice weather but but justice doesnt work like that you dont get to decide when and how your debt is paid
45398,we all carry our prisons with us ha
45399,go just go i cant save them while youre here
45400,right
45401,hes gone
45402,away from here look up any second now youll see the vapour trail of his ship this is their home not the backdrop for your revenge lookup go after him take this battle away from  jex
45403,whats going on  computer

45451,youre thinking of stopping arent you you and rory
45452,but youre considering it
45453,why
45454,thats not what it is
45455,im not running away but this is one corner of one country in one continent on one planet thats a corner of a galaxy thats a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond and there is so much so much to see amy because it goes so fast im not running away from things i am running to them before they flare and fade forever and its all right our lives wont run the same they cant one day soon maybe youll stop ive known for a while
45456,because you were the first the first face this face saw and youre seared onto my hearts amelia pond you always will be im running to you and rory before you fade from me
45457,yeah you do pond and you always get what you want they got what they wanted
45458,the cubes thats why they stopped come on
45459,hmm
45460,what
45461,seven seven whats important about seven seven wonders of the world seven streams of the river ota seven sides of a cube
45462,not if you count the inside
45463,why would it be minutes kate we have to get humanity away from those cubes god knows what theyll do if they hit zero get the information out any way you can news channels websites radio text messages people have to know that the cubes are dangerous
45464,because theyre clever allow people enough time to collect them take them into their homes their lives humans the great early adopters and then wham profile every inch of earths existence
45465,get that information out any way you can go
45466,every cube was activated there must be signals energy fluctuations on a colossal scale there must be some trace there cant not be we need to think of all the variables all the possibilities okay go go go go go  matthew
45467,remotely isnt my style see you after
45468,there is nothing in here
45469,why why is there nothing inside why it doesnt make any sense
45470,ah no no no we are very far from safe all along every action has been deliberate why draw attention to the cubes if they dont contain anything
45471,what they cant be dying how how are they dying
45472,the cubes brought people close together they opened and then argh
45473,argh ah i dont know
45474,thats it oh oh oh only one heart other ones not working
45475,oh no no no no just a short circuit turn around turn around tell me show me ten seconds after the cubes opened show me the patterns in their electrical currents
45476,yes the power cut they zapped the power and then argh theyre signal boxes people leaning in wham pure electrical surge out of the cube targeted at the nearest human heart the heart an organ powered by electrical currents shortcircuited how to destroy a human go for the heart ow crikey moses
45477,and look at them all pulsing bold as brass seven of them all across the world ow seven stations seven minutes why is that important argh ow ow how do you people manage one heart it is pitiful a wormhole bridging two dimensions seven of them hitched onto this planet but wheres the closest one glasses zoom in
45478,kate i have to find the wormhole but the attacks could still happen tell the world tell them how to deal with this the world needs your leadership right now
45479,of course you will good luck kate argh argh
45480,not much longer i need to locate the wormhole portal
45481,outlier droid monitoring everything if i shut her down i can
45482,what no no no no that wont work im a time lord
45483,whoo ooo ooo welcome back lefty whoaho two hearts woo back in the game ah never do that to me again
45484,the energy signals converge here does seem a bit cramped though
45485,ah soborian smelling salts outlawed in seven galaxies
45486,absolutely no idea get him to the portal
45487,its not possible i thought the shakri were a myth a myth to keep the young of gallifrey in their place
45488,the shakri craft connected to earth through seven portals and seven minutes ah but why
45489,why the cubes why earth
45490,erase humanity before it colonises space we thought the cubes were an invasion the start of war
45491,oi didnt i tell you two to go
45492,some people call it judgment day or the reckoning
45493,ive never wanted to find out
45494,the pest controllers of the universe thats how the tales went isnt it
45495,you can talk wolf in your grandmothers nightdress so here you are depositing slug pellets all over the earth made attractive so humans will collect them hoping to find something beautiful inside because thats what they are not pests or plague creatures of hope forever building and reaching making mistakes of course every life form does but but they learn and they strive for greater and they achieve it you want a tally put their achievements against their failings through the whole of time i will back humanity against the shakri every time
45496,its going to release more cubes to kill more people
45497,he was never really here just the ships automated interface like a talking propaganda poster i can stop the second wave i can disconnect all the shakri craft from their portals leave them drifting in the darkspace ah but all those people who were near the cubes so many of them will have died
45498,of course ah beautiful but ponds ponds we are going to go one better than that the shakri used the cubes to turn peoples hearts off bingo were going to use them to turn them back on again
45499,well creatures of hope has to

45634,clara who
45635,oh dangerous question
45636,the snow emits a low level telepathic field
45637,it seems to reflect peoples thoughts and memories and because its unusual somehow it carries a previous shape and
45638,ah interesting well were you thinking about it
45639,well stop clara stop thinking about the snowmen
45640,youre caught in their telepathic field theyre mirroring you the more you think about the snowmen the more they appear imagine them melting picture it picture them melted
45641,well if it does you know what to do about it
45642,dont come looking for me forget about me you understand
45643,not my problem merry christmas take her back where we found her

45652,ooo talking snow i love new things
45653,takes one to snow one right lets see multinucleate crystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what it finds looks like snow isnt snow
45654,shut up im making deductions its very exciting now what are you eh a flock of space crystals a swarm the snowmen are foot soldiers mindless predators but you youre the clever one youre moriarty so you turn up on a planet you generate a telepathic field to learn what you can and when youve learnt enough what do you do you cant conquer the world using snowmen snowmen are rubbish in july youll have to be better than that youll have to evolve    servant
45655,you need to translate yourself into something more well human
45656,to do that youd need a perfect duplicate of human dna in ice form where do you find that  servant
45657,now lets see most opened file most viewed page
45658,body frozen in a pond the snow gets a good long look at a human being like a full body scan everything they need to evolve pond good point clara what are you doing here
45659,grenades
45660,help for what
45661,investigation who says im investigating do you think im going to start investigating just because some bird smiles at me who do you think i am

45681,way aye aye well done straxie still got it buddy
45682,so theres something here they want
45683,exactly
45684,because shes a perfect duplication of human dna in ice crystal form the ultimate fusion of snow and humanity to live here the snow needs to evolve and shes the blueprint shes what they need to become when the snow melted last night did the pond
45685,living ice that will never melt if the snow gets hold of that creature on the stairs it will learn to make more of them it will build an army of ice and it will be the last day of humanity on this planet
45686,you do that a lot
45687,who said i like you

46168,what
46169,ah its not a parallel universe its a pocket universe plus it is collapsing i mean the tardis could get in there all right but entropy would bleed her power sources you see trap her there until the entire universe decayed back into the quantum foam which would take about three minutes give or take you know
46170,a subset of the eye of harmony
46171,of course you dont be weird if you did i barely do myself right you sit down all the way from metebelis three
46172,it amplifies your natural abilities like a microphone or a pooper scooper

46243,ever seen a spaceship get ugly
46244,she wont relinquish it her basic genetic material
46245,its diverting us spinning a maze around us we will never reach clara in time
46246,no point in building walls youll just know how to smash them down its found other ways of controlling you smart bunch time lords no dress sense dreadful hats but smart if you want to get out of here let that circuit go it is creating a labyrinth
46247,your concern for your brother is really touching the android is more cut up about it that you now will you two stop bickering and listen there is something else down there
46248,fellas multiple lifeforms on board the tardis with us i am getting a massive signal
46249,oh youre not going to like the answer about two steps away one step
46250,no its an echo the console room is the safest place on the ship it can replicate itself any number of times its trying to protect us
46251,team tardis
46252,theres more than one echo room hey look look the tardis has got clara safe that was her that was her there thank you thank you thank you
46253,its like a light switch two positions flickering at superinfinite speeds were only together for a brief second shush

46264,detour
46265,trust me some things you dont want to know
46266,run move move

46269,if youre giving me the option id say this ones real
46270,clara dont ask me any more  clara 2

46480,well a wednesday definitely next wednesday last wednesday
46481,from the beginning she was impossible the impossible girl i met her in the dalek asylum never saw her face and she died i met her again in victorian london and she died saved my life both times by giving her own but now shes back and were running together and shes perfect perfect in every way for me except she cant remember that we ever met clara my clara always brave always funny always exactly what i need perfect too perfect get used to not knowing i thought i never would i was wrong i know who clara oswald is i know how she came to be in my life and i know what she will always mean i found out the day we went to trenzalore
46482,angie artie am i getting warm am i getting warm
46483,ha clara how are you dont worry everything is under control
46484,oh mister maitland went next door so i said id look after the kids they wanted to go to the cinema but i said no i said no not until you wake up i was very firm
46485,yes where are they
46486,the little daleks whats wrong
46487,an old friend of mine
46488,yes an ex river asked vastra for the exact words what were they
46489,sorry and it was trenzalore definitely trenzalore
46490,oh dear sorry
46491,trenzalore ive heard the name of course dorium mentioned it a few others always suspected what it was never wanted to find out myself river would know though river always knew right come here give me your hand now the coordinates you saw will still be in your memory im linking you into the tardis telepathic circuit wont hurt a bit
46492,i lied
46493,no
46494,when you are a time traveller there is one place you must never go one place in all of space and time you must never ever find yourself
46495,you didnt listen did you you lot never do thats the problem the doctor has a secret he will take to the grave it is discovered he wasnt talking about my secret no no no thats not whats been found he was talking about my grave trenzalore is where im buried
46496,because we all do somewhere out there in the future waiting for us
46497,i have to save vastra and strax jenny too if its still possible they they cared for me during the dark times never questioned me never judged me they were just kind i owe them i have a duty no point in telling you this is too dangerous
46498,apparently by breaking into my own tomb
46499,shes just figured out where were going shes against it im about to cross my own timeline in the biggest way possible the tardis doesnt like it shes fighting it hang on hang on
46500,she doesnt want to land shes shut down
46501,we must be close
46502,dont be silly we fall
46503,its more than that im a time traveller ive probably timetravelled more than anyone else
46504,meaning my grave is potentially the most dangerous place in the universe shall we
46505,its a battlefield graveyard my final battle
46506,theyre soldiers the bigger the gravestone the higher the rank
46507,its the tardis
46508,no when a tardis is dying sometimes the dimension dams start breaking down they used to call it a size leak all the bigger on the inside starts leaking to the outside it grows when i say thats the tardis i dont mean it looks like the tardis i mean it actually is the tardis my tardis from the future what else would they bury me in
46509,who are you talking to we need to get river
46510,no it cant
46511,oh shes dead im afraid shes been dead for a very long time
46512,long story but her grave cant be here
46513,the gravestone
46514,yeah maybe
46515,yes of course makes sense theyd never bury my wife out here
