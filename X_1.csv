4,yes we saw her from across the street
5,i beg your pardon
6,we heard a young girls voice call out to you
7,it came from in here
8,i certainly did not imagine it
9,would it therefore be unreasonable to ask you to let us have a look inside
10,wont you help us were two of her teachers from the coal hill school we saw her come in and we havent seen her leave naturally were worried
11,not until were satisfied that susan isnt in there and frankly i dont understand your attitude
12,will you open the door
13,then what are you afraid to show us
14,i think wed better go and fetch a policeman
15,and youre coming with us
16,but of course it was susan susan susan are you in there its mister chesterton and miss wright susan
17,but why wont you help us
18,while you nip off quietly in the other direction
19,she is in there
20,barbara
21,where are we
22,yes
23,but it was just a telephone box
24,but why didnt you tell us that
25,but it was a police telephone box i walked all around it barbara you saw me
26,no just a minute i know this is absurd but i feel
27,i walked all round it
28,but i want to understand
29,its an illusion it must be
30,what are you doing here
31,no
32,yes
33,well yes but i still dont know
34,ship

37,youre treating us like children
38,your civilisation
39,its true every word of its true you dont know what youve done coming in here grandfather let them go now please look if they dont understand they cant they cant hurt us at all i understand these people better than you their minds reject things they dont understand
40,he closed the doors from over there i saw him now which is it which is it which control operates the door
41,i know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream i dont expect to find solved in a junkyard
42,very well then ill have to risk it myself
43,grandfather let them go now please
44,but they wont say anything
45,no grandfather weve had all this out before
46,i want to stay but theyre both kind people why wont you trust them all youve got to do is ask them to promise to keep our secret
47,i wont go grandfather i wont leave the twentieth century id rather leave the tardis and you
48,no i mean it
49,oh no grandfather no
50,no
51,the base is steady
52,weve left 1963
53,well look at the scanner screen
54,sand and rock
55,i dont believe it
56,but youre wrong mister chesterton
57,just open the doors doctor foreman
58,yes i know but are you going to open the doors or arent you
59,you see
60,its reading normal grandfather
61,well just open the doors and prove your point
62,grandfather do you know where we are
63,just a minute you say weve gone back in time
64,so that when we go out of that door we wont be in a junkyard in london in england in the year 1963
65,but it is ridiculous time doesnt go round and round in circles you cant get on and off whenever you like in the past or the future
66,it doesnt go anywhere it just happens and then its finished
67,i cant help it i just believe them thats all
68,yes
69,thats not on the screen
70,be careful grandfather
71,but there must be some explanation
72,the creature has opened its eyes
73,i will take him to the cave of skulls and he will tell me the secret
74,he will make it for me
75,kals creature he makes fire only for kal
76,make fire make fire come from your fingers as i saw you
77,grandfather
78,no grandfather
79,but how are we going to get out of this
80,dont blame yourself grandfather
81,theyre all the same theyve been split open  episode three  the forest of fear
82,oh dont blame yourself grandfather
83,its no good it keeps crumbling
84,it may only be a small opening dont count on it
85,oh all right
86,grandfather i knew youd think of something
87,surely we should get the girls free
88,all right
89,all right
90,what
91,yes yes ill try youre trying to help me
92,i never thought once you were afraid
93,whats that
94,i will set you free if you will go away and not make fire fire will bring trouble and death to the tribe
95,now you are leader you are as strong as the beasts you will be stronger still when you know how fire is made stronger than kal
96,we cant stop here
97,look weve got to go further on
98,try try i shall have to carry you
99,oh grandfather come on
100,if thats true we must be quite near the ship how are you feeling
101,i dont know i saw something over there in the bushes
102,what do you think it could have been grandfather
103,im so cold
104,oh good is there any chance of them following us
105,yes thats why i dont want to stop here too long
106,no well change the order you and susan go in front barbara and ill bring up the rear susan seems to remember the way better than any of us
107,there isnt time to vote on it
108,if there were only two of us you could find your own way back to the ship
109,and youre a stubborn old man but you will lead the girls in between and ill bring up the rear because thats the safest way barbara was probably right i thought we heard something when we stopped back there
110,why are you so confident about it
111,i think wed better get going doctor will you lead
112,a dead animal
113,im going too
114,no grandfather we cant leave them
115,no
116,yes i know
117,yes lots
118,all right now were helping them youre a doctor do something

176,all right all right i admit it a small part of the blame is ours
177,but naturally were anxious what are we going to do can we live here what do we eat there are millions of questions

218,i can hear a ticking noise
219,yes over here somewhere
220,its coming from in here    ian ah this is more hopeful we ought to find some mercury here
221,yes hard to imagine what sort of people these are
222,yes but how do they use their intelligence what form does it take
223,but look at the needle its past the danger point
224,radiation sickness
225,what but how do you explain the buildings theyre intact
226,what but how much radiation and how badly
227,but dont you remember we cant move the ship until we find the mercury for the fluid link

242,grandfather youll feel better soon i brought the drugs back
243,no were still prisoners
244,well what are they going to do to her  dalek 1
245,all set doctor  the whole pattern of things is suspicious just because the daleks didnt kill us is no reason to trust them
246,the thals have helped us the daleks put us in a cell i know which of the two i prefer
247,ever since you talked alone to the daleks youve been on their side what have they done bribed you or something look i want to know why why are you on their side and against the rest of us
248,ian
249,no of course you didnt
250,fix you for a while    dalek 2

258,yes their eye is flexible like a large camera lens
259,whatever it is itll do for what we want
260,shh hes coming
261,yes
262,yes doctor perhaps we can stage something you know a distraction and when the lens looks the other way throw something over it

270,ian come on out of the way
271,yes grandfather
272,youll have to help me  lets roll it off the cloak a bit more all right
273,not much room for my legs but try the top
274,its very cramped indeed
275,do you mean like this
276,i cant make this thing move its full of controls
277,surely theyll know that were pushing you
278,wait this looks like the place stay there  theres a great iron door with a dalek on guard and beyond the door theres a lift
279,no close the doors the girl cannot run far inside
280,the clasp is stuck
281,the door is locked emergency alarm  dalek 1
282,i cant move it it wont budge
283,ow that doors red hot
284,well have to move you into the lift
285,i dont understand it it moved easily enough before
286,are you sure
287,dont waste time go on
288,no im not leaving ian
289,go on
290,how long will it take them to cut through the door
291,but even if he does get out hes stuck down there his only way out is the lift we must go back for him
292,yes thank you susan
293,yes but where exactly are we
294,theres someone down there look by that sort of gateway thing beyond the low building i saw someone cross that space
295,the thals theyve come for food supplies
296,oh its no good this room must be soundproof we must find a way of getting down there
297,yes doctor open it
298,whats the matter with it
299,doctor keep working the door  its no good wait come over here and give me a hand quick now all push together
300,be right with you
301,wait there no no i think were all right
302,no no i must warn the thals
303,we cant let them walk into a trap
304,ill be there
305,no not yet
306,the complete history of our planet skaro is here it seems now that no one will survive to read it
307,yes skaro is the twelfth planet here
308,each of these maps is a tiny section of another solar system so the total picture can be built up
309,yes well i say total of course we were only able to map out as far as our electroscopes allowed
310,oh yes
311,yes but are they really pacifists i mean genuinely so or is it a belief thats become a reality because theyve never had to prove it
312,you mean this  became
313,yes
314,the original dalek
315,is this a sword the thals holding
316,were they
317,antodus is feeling much better
318,oh grandfather couldnt we stay a bit longer the thals are such nice people
319,i wonder if theres any point in reminding the thals of what they used to be
320,oh theyre opposed to fighting we were trying to convince them that it was a necessity for their own survival
321,yes lets get in the ship and get as far away from here as possible
322,any luck grandfather
323,well have you made another fluid link yet
324,oh no
325,well dont worry about it now doctor its happened
326,well i will be if you dont get my name right
327,its chesterton
328,how you two can stand there wasting time with small talk beats me
329,you always think of something grandfather
330,of course not
331,they have one great disadvantage they have no arms or ammunition
332,but grandfather weve been talking and arguing about this all morning the thals wont fight theyre against war
333,why
334,the doctors right ian cant you see if only we can get the thals to attack the city we could beat the daleks and get the link back
335,i will not allow you to use the thals to fight for us
336,except mine and susans and the doctors
337,all youre doing is playing with words
338,well lets see what happens
339,yes he is
340,to have self respect at this moment anyone could come in here they could rob they could steal
341,i could always have destroyed it if youd decided differently
342,yes i know but i mean the daleks wont be on guard there theres a chance to take them by surprise believe me im not happy about this but its the best possible chance there is
343,yes i think thats the best plan
344,the main ventilators seem to be over in this section
345,oh thats wrong it goes down there and up
346,no
347,grandfather get down
348,they dont leave much to chance
349,if they have pictures of the entrance to the city how can we do anything
350,yes we do have speed on our side
351,we cant keep up this light reflection for long
352,we cant be sure of that grandfather
353,doctor look
354,yes
355,hey grandfather look
356,is this what you want
357,well how do you know that
358,i wonder if i can open this box there arent any hinges on it oh thats it look look it slides up
359,look we cant wait around here too long
360,but i cant leave you two here
361,very well then but dont waste time here ill come back for you if i can
362,oh what a good idea yes
363,of course
364,what about this one
365,look grandfather this is marvellous but they must have a fault locator somewhere we must get away from here
366,yes but we mustnt waste time
367,we must go now
368,right rope coming over      dalek 1
369,why are you doing this
370,what we need for life means death for the thals
371,only one race can survive
372,we wish to escape captivity go out and rebuild the planet skaro our oxygen distributors will be subjected to waste radiation by the ejector capsule
373,except the daleks
374,now
375,cant we stop them cant we do anything
376,its true we have  dalek 1
377,grandfather theyre coming

380,doctor doctor i think theyre dying  dalek 1
381,yes hes very badly hurt but hes alive  dalek 1
382,its finished the final war five hundred years of destruction end in this
383,yes and get the ship working again doctor
384,yes if only thered been some other way
385,which is
386,where do you get your knowledge doctor you know there never seems to have been time to ask but we dont really know where you come from or why
387,but you must stay and help us we could learn from you
388,well then stay and advise us please
389,wont you rest with us
390,its lovely by the way doctor have you fitted the fluid link
391,goodbye ian
392,right

394,how are you
395,you cut your forehead but youll be all right
396,where show me i cant see anything theres no bump or bruise or anything
397,susan you dont need that
398,but where where are we
399,can we have some light in here  doctor
400,everythings in a mess
401,no
402,yes
403,do you think something could have got into the ship
404,when the doors were open
405,yes
406,or another intelligence
407,no it isnt but does it have to be i mean things arent always very logical are they its just that ones been through so much ive
408,probably a mechanical fault
409,yes yes of course i will
410,i wouldnt go near the control column if i were you doctor it might give you an electric shock
411,are you all right
412,what can i do to help
413,no no he mustnt
414,yes grandfather i tried to touch it and it was like being hit but without any pain
415,well the back of my neck hurt
416,funny it didnt affect barbara and me like that
417,nothing happened to you
418,oh yes i remember that
419,oh i recognise that thats where we nearly lost the tardis four or five journeys back
420,can you explain it
421,no i dont think so
422,well whats all that about
423,why me
424,look why dont we just try and open the doors and see for ourselves whats outside
425,but youve just been telling us that the only people inside are ourselves
426,what are you talking about
427,dont be ridiculous we were all knocked out
428,absolute nonsense
429,but you checked everything yourself and you couldnt find anything wrong with it
430,but why would we for what reason
431,oh dont be so stupid
432,how dare you do you realise you stupid old man that youd have died in the cave of skulls if ian hadnt made fire for you
433,and what about what we went through against the daleks not just for us but for you and susan too and all because you tricked us into going down to the city
434,you cant blame us for this doctor where is he
435,i wish i could understand you doctor one moment youre abusing us and the next youre playing the perfect butler
436,doctor some very strange things are happening i feel were in a very dangerous position this is no time for personal quarrels
437,i think you should go and apologise to barbara at once
438,frankly doctor i find it hard to keep pace with you
439,results for good or for evil
440,try and get some sleep    episode two  the brink of disaster
441,ian
442,well help him
443,but now hes fainted just like susan did
444,oh what does it matter
445,but he has fainted look at him
446,no he isnt oh doctor dont you see something terribles happening to all of us
447,oh that isnt true
448,but youre wrong i swear we havent done anything
449,no
450,well what are you going to do
451,how did he get like this
452,what do you think weve done hypnotised you drugged you susan we wouldnt do anything like that believe me
453,i do believe you grandfather they couldnt have done all the things that happened
454,no its not a question of being smart
455,no you cant do that
456,but you cant open the doors
457,look grandfather youve no means of telling whats out there there may be no air it may be freezing it may be too hot to exist
458,why are you so suspicious of us
459,what are you two saying to each other
460,now
461,oh grandfather he doesnt know whats happening i wont let you do this
462,the danger signal
463,its all right
464,but everything cant be everything cant be wrong
465,i pulled you away the controls are alive
466,it went off again grandfather
467,yes
468,oh youre all right that drink you gave us
469,i thought so
470,yes and i told you not to go near the control column i told you youll electrocute yourself
471,i counted
472,yes i think im all right
473,just a moment why did you say that the brink of destruction
474,what total disintegration
475,well what is then
476,the column
477,doctor i thought it only moved when the power was on
478,well what made it move
479,well the power would be free to escape
480,the end what are you talking about
481,ten minutes as little as that
482,be careful doctor
483,dont susan please dont
484,yes it did
485,you say it has a builtin defence mechanism
486,is that feasible doctor
487,you say the power is under this column
488,and the column holds it down
489,well then what would make it want to escape
490,something outside
491,a magnetic force
492,but it could be the power escaping
493,yes the scanner i wonder
494,wont know what
495,theres no hope then
496,oh just a theory of mine that didnt work
497,i am right i know i am whenever theres a good picture the doors open because its safe for us to go outside and then it shows us a terrible picture and the doors close again
498,and the ship refused to destroy itself
499,the defence mechanism stopped the ship and its been trying to tell us so ever since
500,but doctor where are we when we left the planet skaro where did you ask the machine to take us to think doctor
501,the fast return switch youve sent us back too far doctor show me show me that switch where is it
502,yes
503,doctor we havent got very much time left
504,yes well how does it work
505,what you mean its been on all this time
506,well come on doctor lets get it unstuck
507,whats wrong
508,hurry doctor hurry
509,are you sure
510,grandfather
511,what happened
512,but why didnt the fault locator tell us
513,oh i see so if the spring were broken it would be as if your finger were pressing it down all the time
514,grandfather what about them you said some terrible things to them when i thought he was going to attack you even i was against him
515,dont bother to say anything doctor you know there are times when i can read every thought on your face
516,i i    doctor

557,oh no my lord the warlord tegana is a special emissary from the camp of the great mongol lord khan noghai who has been at war with kublai khan
558,the war is over my lord noghai has sued for peace and tegana travels to kublais court to discuss the armistice plans
559,i find your caravan most unusual doctor
560,and in need of repair
561,messer marco has ordered a sledge to be made hes going to bring the tardis down here
562,its a town on the edge of the gobi desert beyond kashgar and yarkand
563,doctor i once transported an entire army and its equipment from cathay to india all without loss
564,no
565,the mongol bearers still half believe that you are evil spirits they also believe that outside your caravan you are harmless however should any of you attempt to enter there would be trouble
566,well its it means wonderful its a verb we often use on earth
567,doctor
568,theyve set the tardis up in the courtyard
569,please sit down doctor
570,please be seated

574,it was as you say twelve seventy seven since then i have travelled to every corner of his domain and beyond it two years ago my father my uncle and i asked the khan for permission to go home he refused i think we had all served him too well
575,doctor i have not seen my home for eighteen years i want to go back
576,yes
577,you can make another
578,you do me an injustice doctor i will not leave you stranded in cathay just as i did not let you die on the mountain no you will come with me to venice and make another one there

597,yes i know it to be true

600,if they had ian the remains would still be visible doctor
601,barbara may have told you that were leaving here tomorrow so get all the rest you can today you may use your caravan again but before we leave in the morning it will be locked and the key handed over to me

606,i have no idea

608,grandfather
609,what do you know about the hashashin
610,well pingcho knows a story and shes going to tell us about it
611,gracious maidens gentle lords pray attend me while i tell my tale of alaeddin the old man of the mountains who by devious schemes evil designs and foul murders ruled the land  no host of arms no vast array of banners served this wicked lord they were but few ruthless reckless men who obeyed his cruel commands  thus did he persuade them  promising paradise he gave his followers a potent draught and whilst they slept transported them to a vale where streams of milk and honey wine and water flowed  here were gardens and flowers of every hue and essence here too golden pavilions outshone the sun and even the stars of heaven envied the bejewelled interiors strewn with incomparable silks tapestries and treasures  handmaidens dulcetvoiced soft of face attended them and thus bemused did they dwell in this manmade paradise until alaeddin intent upon some evil deed proffered again the hashish draught and brought them sleeping to his castle  what lord are we cast out of paradise awakening they cried  not so go abroad seek out my enemies and strike them down but care not for your lives paradise is eternal  so terror stalked the land for many years then one day came mighty hulagu to stand before alaeddins lair for three long years in siege thus fell alaeddin and his men  now honest hands reap harvests of life from the soil where death and evil reigned and those who journey through the vale are heard to say tis truly paradise today
612,lets get started
613,no doctor you stay here and nobody else move
614,grandfather grandfather dont worry about pingcho you can trust her
615,we think we might know where barbara is
616,yes and barbara was very interested so we thought she might have gone off to a look without asking anybody because messer marco might have tried to stop her
617,i do not know my lord but chenchu would know
618,i arrived this very moment my lord
619,the cave of five hundred
620,on the road to suchow my lord set back against the foothills
621,about a third of a league my lord
622,messer marco will be angry he told us to stay here
623,grandfather youll never find it on your own come on
624,id prefer not to susan
625,grandfather were supposed to be looking for barbara
626,he forced me

631,look look
632,what are you doing here

636,ian over here
637,round the corner
638,no
639,leave before the spirits are angered
640,hes not the only one susan saw the eyes in one of the faces move

643,of course i did
644,obey me  polo
645,how much longer do you think youll need
646,but thats marvellous doctor
647,and thats when we say goodbye to marco polo
648,well i shall be jolly glad to leave here in fact the only regrets ill have will be for susan
649,oh i think she and pingcho are very fond of each other its a pity theyve been kept apart so much
650,what on earth do you mean
651,what
652,with a stake through the heart
653,im sorry i doubted your word tegana give me the key doctor

660,and polo has both keys
661,grandfather pingcho wouldnt tell him about the second key i know she wouldnt
662,oh dont you worry about that now we must concentrate on getting one of those keys back
663,i dont know somehow ill do it

674,bamboo the bandits thought there were devils in the fire and fled
675,well in battle all men face death
676,surely he cant punish us by trying to escape we saved his life

682,he knows were on to him
683,tegana wasnt to know that otherwise hed have given the alarm
684,you mean he was implicated in the attack
685,ian do you remember that bandit we buried this morning i knew id seen him somewhere before he was in the cave of five hundred eyes

703,they would all have escaped if i had not caught this one
704,im sorry grandfather
705,we wait the great khans pleasure
706,are they
707,oh theyre enormous they have to be to accommodate the khans two great passions hunting and falconry do you know in his stables he has ten thousand white stallions
708,when great kublai khan appears you will make your obeisance to him so that he may look kindly upon you and spare your worthless lives
709,kowtow kneel upon the ground and touch your forehead upon the floor three times
710,kublai khan is the mightiest man the world has ever seen not to pay him homage will cost you your head
711,grandfather please
712,kowtow kowtow
713,do you mock our afflictions
714,what ails it
715,dont be impertinent
716,doctor oh is he are you perchance a physician
717,no i think it is better that you ride with us
718,you spoke
719,then walk
720,the master of the world has a carriage of state
721,tomorrow you ride in state with us
722,we have healing waters here which relieve my gout come let us observe their effects upon your aches and pains
723,oh what a trial old age is
724,the great khan has left the summer palace at shangtu my lord you will see him in peking
725,youre too good for us at backgammon tea
726,oh that is our reckoning
727,what do we owe
728,thats not too bad so far
729,oh that what else what more
730,one wins one loses my dear
731,youre not wagering are you you know how it affects your gout
732,charming indeed and yet there are moments old friend when we wish our character were more like that of our lamented grandfather genghis did you hear of him
733,oh he was the warrior of the family nothing frightened him we are the clan of the statistician and the administrator oh she will be furious with me when she finds out what i have lost
734,no no no these are bets of honour
735,and if you win
736,no not that no take something else the island of sumatra we cant give you marcos gift we havent even seen it yet
737,oh marco polo well would you object to one interruption
738,the caravan
739,nothing my lord i will leave you to your game
740,grandfather grandfather youve not lost
741,no you overestimated yourself
742,well we can be quite clear about that tegana said i serve noghai and he will conquer the world with the help of the tardis
743,im sure tegana was behind that bandit raid but why
744,i remember
745,the khan was furious because noghai had moved his armies from samarkand to karakorum
746,yes that makes sense even so why should kublai khan fear noghai he has an enormous army and hes already defeated him once surely
747,grandfather do you mean to say teganas going to assassinate the khan
748,ive had it
749,look how are we going to get ian past the guard
750,teganas in the throne room with the khan now
751,take him away doctor take the keys quickly
752,now go
753,go
754,any radiation doctor
755,pity you dont have colour television
756,where is it then
757,grandfather can we go and have a look can we
758,no
759,well i thought when you switched the scanner on i thought i saw something move up there oh probably just a shadow
760,it isnt frozen is it
761,grandfather do you think its safe to go for a swim
762,theres nothing growing
763,its glass
764,do you think the sand turned into glass
765,then everything out there is acid too a sea of acid
766,she was a bit frightened of losing her shoes but shes gone back to the ship for another pair
767,or a one man submarine its certainly designed for going under the water
768,yes i dont know if its occurred to you doctor but this means this place is inhabited
769,doctor
770,grandfather
771,now lets have a look at you
772,its a protective suit
773,you mean the acid got in poor devil
774,look at that fantastic building
775,she isnt inside anywhere
776,ian there are your boots and there are susans footprints in the sand here
777,what you mean is that all visitors are unwelcome
778,we must find susan she may have gone to have a look at that building
779,yes marvellous isnt it
780,well for a start lets make a circuit of this place
781,man
782,are these the ones that live here
783,so the men from the glass submarines are intruders like us
784,well maybe were to be killed too
785,good idea
786,yes and all our knowledge culminated in the manufacture of this at the time it was called the conscience of marinus marinus that is the name of our planet at first this machine was simply a judge and jury that was never wrong and unfair and then we added to it improved on it made it more and more sophisticated so that finally it became possible to radiate its power and influence the minds of men throughout the planet they no longer had to decide what was wrong or right the machine decided for them
787,the keys are very simple but the microcircuits inside are very complicated a permutation of numbers and signals that would take a thousand years to unravel and besides since the keys were hidden i have worked on this machine and modified it so that when theyre replaced
788,oh come on grandfather
789,well its some sort of invisible barrier what do you make of it doctor
790,its like an invisible wall
791,goes all the way round cant see a cause to it
792,if we return
793,perhaps you will bring me news of my daughter i miss her yes i miss her
794,i wouldnt think of asking you to travel in such an absurd way no im going to give you a device which will enable you to move from place to place
795,what this little thing
796,its barbaras travel dial look theres blood on it  episode two  the velvet web
797,of course she would
798,lets get inside
799,doctor theres blood on this strap that means shes hurt maybe badly we cant argue now lets get inside

805,could i have a dress made
806,well id love a dress made from this silk here
807,and you have you no wish no great desire
808,what is it grandfather
809,perhaps in the morning when you see the laboratory you will find our way of life easier to understand to believe now as it is late i suggest you sleep in the morning when you wake you will learn everything about morphoton
810,goodnight
811,oh good morning thank you very much
812,yes
813,why not help yourself theres plenty more
814,yes barbara she really is having a deep sleep isnt she

828,doctor what did you mean altos is going with you
829,good lets go then
830,i wish to join you too
831,arbitan hadnt heard from either of you or anyone else for that matter
832,it may just be that he couldnt reach the key it lies somewhere in the city of millenius
833,what you mean go two jumps ahead and try and find the fourth key
834,do you know how to adjust the dial grandfather
835,yours well arent i coming
836,but i want to go with you
837,all right wont be for long though will it
838,i was wondering if we should fix a time to meet
839,i hope everything wont be as bad as this place
840,well goodbye doctor and take care of yourself
841,so am i i wish you well doctor
842,goodbye grandfather
843,susan she should have waited for us
844,we must find him barbara we must the laws in this country are a mockery
845,im just glad were back together again
846,we havent much time for a talk doctor in a moment ive got to go in there and face an accusation of murder i need a man to defend me
847,representative for the defence you have a grave duty you have offered your services in this matter which complies with the law of the city of millenius in that any person may speak on behalf of another are you acquainted with our laws
848,every latitude will be allowed to you and if you are at fault i will give you directions
849,the representative of the court eyesen has spoken his facts you may now reply
850,the demand is reasonable in itself the crime of murder in millenius is in itself unusual then i grant you two days
851,i congratulate you
852,it will not alter the outcome
853,well done doctor
854,yes you found him doctor
855,and he was killed
856,in two days
857,and reasons for people being found not guilty
858,what can i do grandfather
859,yes what can i do doctor
860,yes and thats the only element of the case i dont understand my men did a heat reflector search of this room it is absolutely certain that the microkey isnt in here it is equally certain that its not been taken from here
861,the body was searched it wasnt there
862,thats fantastic it couldnt disappear into thin air
863,but we know the murderer it was chesterton
864,very well
865,any ideas well
866,have you any ideas how the key got out of here
867,grandfather do you mean you know how where
868,but how tarrons been working on it all day youve only been here a few minutes
869,yes where as we know hes innocent
870,ill be the body
871,yes yes i think i would
872,the relief guard
873,yes of course thats why the guard inside let him in in the first place he knew him he even expected him
874,that must be how it happened ill go and tell tarron
875,but surely if you know where the key is thats proof
876,oh what do we do then
877,we will now hear the statement from the representative of the accused and convicted
878,but can you substantiate this
879,yes
880,yes i do
881,it is here
882,it was given to me by the man who killed the guard
883,yes
884,all right ill tell you everything im not in this alone they made me do it ill tell you
885,you say you have three of the microkeys in your possession
886,still in the place where it was hidden by the murderer chesterton
887,there are a number of other points which wed like to see cleared up
888,the tribunal concurs though it has deprived us of more detailed evidence the unfortunate death of guardian ayden has surely not affected the issue we will now hear a statement a closing statement from the defence
889,dont take it too hard
890,i just wanted to say what a good job you did on the defence
891,i am sorry we couldnt have met under happier circumstances
892,goodbye
893,its time to leave sir
894,shouldnt have taken the chance though i had no right to risk susans life
895,but surely theyll stop the execution now that kalas confessed
896,kalas made a full statement shes named her accomplice
897,no i cant kalas sworn testimony states that the man she was working with was ian chesterton
898,no
899,oh nothing much just that hed collect the key later and then pick her up
900,how did you know it was there doctor
901,oh yes theyve owned up to everything kala and the prosecutor had planned to steal the key and sell it and chesterton here just happened to walk right into the middle of it they made him look so guilty i never doubted for a moment he was the one
902,thank heaven you remembered reading pyrrho doctor
903,what have you sent them on ahead doctor
904,the senior judge has just written this
905,youve just got permission to take the key sir
906,i see youre all wearing them what are they for
907,i dont believe it
908,go
909,i dont understand where have they gone
910,the man who was with us the doctor he has it

1024,my opponent has been selected i know his name and i fear defeat
1025,only my hands my strength lies in the use of a spear or a club
1026,no more than i desire a victory
1027,i thank the older servant of yetaxa

1113,if it is your wish let our marriage be postponed what is it youre making
1114,let me intercede with autloc on your friends behalf
1115,how can it be prevented if it is the will of the gods
1116,the gods wish an end to sacrifice
1117,i cannot save him
1118,as is our time together i do not know what its purpose is but ive always known it would take you from me
1119,tomorrow will truly be a day of darkness
1120,tlotoxl is determined to destroy yetaxa
1121,we are a doomed people my dear theres no turning back for us
1122,doctor why wont you listen to me

1130,whats the point of travelling through time and space if we cant change anything nothing tlotoxl had to win
1131,and the one man i had respect for i deceived poor autloc i gave him false hope and in the end he lost his faith
1132,whats the matter doctor
1133,what sort of mystery
1134,yes according to these controls here weve stopped
1135,perhaps weve landed on top of something
1136,perhaps weve landed on top of something
1137,or inside something
1138,try the scanner doctor
1139,that could be caused by an unsuppressed motor
1140,shall we go outside grandfather
1141,i dont know why we ever bother to leave the ship
1142,yes
1143,and the aztecs
1144,what did you do
1145,the tardis was inside the tower
1146,have you checked everything doctor
1147,oh just the unknown then
1148,you were right barbara we have landed in something
1149,suffocation doctor
1150,grandfather lets go back to the tardis
1151,you mean that whatever it was killed them could kill us
1152,yes and they both stopped at about three oclock
1153,then theyve only just died
1154,no we cant even bury them
1155,its a heart resuscitator when you found us we were in a very long sleep but we werent dead my name is maitland this is carol richmond my coastronaut
1156,but we might be able to help you
1157,very well ill try to explain out there is a planet we call the sensphere the creatures on it the sensorites have always prevented us from leaving this area of space
1158,exactly but its not that simple they not only control our craft they have some influence over us as well
1159,no i do not mean hypnosis
1160,you see theres john to think of too
1161,it seems to be coming from over here
1162,doctor you must go leave us
1163,its stronger over here doctor
1164,grandfather
1165,permanently but there must be some way of getting in what can we do doctor break down the door
1166,the sensorites
1167,what do they want with us
1168,must get up the other end
1169,im powerless the sensorites are stronger than i am
1170,there
1171,dont try and control the spacecraft its suicide i tell you
1172,the velocity needles hitting the red doctor
1173,its the sensesphere
1174,there the white panel but its useless
1175,youre on collision course
1176,velocity still rising
1177,mach four
1178,yes three lights on
1179,why couldnt i do it
1180,yes my heads much clearer
1181,do you think they were deliberately trying to kill us doctor
1182,yes but for some reason or other your minds arent open to them
1183,you werent afraid they just made you hopeless
1184,right well find it
1185,yes our mineralogist
1186,im afraid thats out of the question
1187,i told you you cant see him
1188,he was dangerous once the sensorites got at his brain
1189,it wont be long now
1190,carol get back to your instruments doctor would you take the controller seat
1191,how long do you think itll take them doctor
1192,yes probably took it back to their own planet
1193,they wouldnt really try to crash us they just keep on playing this game of nerves
1194,why no violence surely weve got the right to protect ourselves
1195,doctor doctor    episode two  the unwilling warriors
1196,doctor look at these two
1197,doctor that things still out there
1198,yes i hear you
1199,hes responding
1200,a door yes
1201,john yes we must get the two girls out
1202,yes i know just that im so worried about barbara and susan
1203,through the loading bay
1204,nobodys arguing about that
1205,its going
1206,so we really can resist them
1207,hes sleeping peacefully now
1208,i had hundreds of voices in my mind grandfather
1209,hes resting now did you know his hair was almost white
1210,in a man of thirty doctor and he looks so old why have the sensorites done this what do they want from us
1211,you see makes sense john mumbling something about riches i think he must have discovered something that the sensorites wanted to keep secret so they silenced him and kept all of you prisoners about their planet
1212,talking to them
1213,that was the first time the sensorites attacked us
1214,anythings better than circling round a planet for ever and being kept alive alive its been more like a living death
1215,i studied it whenever i could but it didnt look like anything that would cause much excitement the sensphere is just an ordinary planet with a slightly bigger land mass than usual but thats all
1216,certainly
1217,yes and when john discovered something he became so excited that his mind opened up and broadcast it to the sensorites and it was something they wanted kept a secret
1218,what
1219,molybdenum
1220,it resists very high temperatures
1221,just tell me how do we lock the doors please try and concentrate
1222,hell be in no condition to help
1223,now well see what the sensorites can do
1224,yes but they wont agree to that
1225,are you saying that youre in
1226,yes
1227,right
1228,because of molybdenum we are not interested in it  sensorite 2
1229,what do you expect us to do drift around for ever  sensorite 1
1230,surely weve proved that we dont need help  sensorite 2
1231,i dont know sounds as though theres something else they can do to us
1232,the sensorites only spoke to me through my
1233,doctor is there no way you can get into your own ship
1234,but theyll never give it back to you
1235,no i cant say i did
1236,what are you driving at doctor
1237,the conclusion being that they would contract in darkness
1238,you cant be sure of that youre only sure they cant see in the dark
1239,which he is of course
1240,well how can you be sure that the sensorites will be frightened of the dark
1241,i never said a word
1242,dont want to go
1243,shh i cant hear them very well oh thats better theres just one voice a long way away
1244,oh oh all right but none of the others must be harmed dont move any of you grandfather it was the only way they knew id agree
1245,to go down with them to their planet otherwise well all be killed    episode three  hidden danger
1246,you cant stop them
1247,why its suspicion thats making them enemies you dont understand the sensorites
1248,youre putting us all in danger
1249,but they only want to talk to me
1250,stop treating me like a child
1251,im sorry grandfather i cant do it
1252,you were absolutely right doctor theyre helpless in the dark
1253,you stole the lock from our ship you also threatened to take us prisoner  sensorite 1
1254,all right i will
1255,no i dont think so shes just growing up ian
1256,i didnt grandfather
1257,well i have opinions too
1258,so im to be treated like a silly little child
1259,oh look grandfather i understand the sensorites theyre timid little people because their minds and mine can communicate sometimes they trust me
1260,look im not saying im as clever as you of course im not but i wont be pushed aside im not a child anymore grandfather im not
1261,all right grandfather ill do as you tell me
1262,is he your ruler  sensorite 2
1263,oh very well then and how do we get down to this sensphere theres no air outside the ship  sensorite 1
1264,gently grandfather dont antagonise them
1265,yes but that still doesnt explain why you attacked maitland and the others  sensorite 1
1266,and yet youre allowing us to visit your planet  sensorite 1
1267,well i suppose its worth it doctor if we get the lock of the tardis back
1268,oh i shall be all right im more worried about you
1269,be patient were all on your side really you know
1270,i shall not wait we will not be safe until these earth creatures are dead
1271,because your people have been dying  sensorite 2
1272,lower caste do you have such distinctions  sensorite 2
1273,good he is a good man not like
1274,thank you for being so understanding
1275,please do not condemn before you know the facts
1276,grandfather please dont
1277,if foreigners visited your planet with intention to steal what would you do would you imprison them would you kill them the man john was like the other humans who came here he became so excited when he found that our planet contained a valuable ore that his mind just opened up and shouted out the secret to us
1278,as long as you taste of the crystal water it is very fine none of the elders drink anything else
1279,this fruit is delicious it tastes like peaches
1280,signified by the twin sash i wear the second elder my advisor wears one sash other important professions wear distinctive markings
1281,i intended to we need help with this calamity the disease is invisible and resists all our attempts to stamp it out it hits all manner of people irrespective of their tasks
1282,no
1283,i cannot imagine we have been fortunate
1284,your granddaughter speaks well
1285,my throat burning i wonder if you could give me a glass of water doctor
1286,there is no hope your friend is dying  episode four  a race against death
1287,the disease hits all manner of people suddenly without warning
1288,no
1289,no
1290,grandfather it doesnt seem like a disease at all
1291,weve done everything together weve come from the spaceship together weve come through the city together
1292,this room the fruit
1293,oh yes
1294,then why do not all who drink the aqueduct water die
1295,you cannot be sure of this
1296,susan
1297,do you wish your companion to stay here
1298,bring some covers
1299,i am distressed by this tragedy what can i do to be of assistance
1300,agreed
1301,they will be honoured
1302,from the first symptoms no one has lived longer than the third day
1303,i must discuss this matter with the second elder
1304,ian ian try and sit up
1305,feeling very weak doctor
1306,drink
1307,john
1308,why cant you make up your mind
1309,sir
1310,i cant hear very clearly their minds arent open to me
1311,doctor i cannot allow you to go to your ship
1312,there is a laboratory here you may prove your poisoned water theory there or not at all
1313,grandfather please they think youre attacking them were sorry theres so much about your planet we dont understand
1314,grandfather
1315,we didnt mean to use sound as a weapon we didnt even know sound hurt you  1st eldergt very well but please be careful in future i wish to see regular reports on the progress of this theory
1316,grandfather please
1317,doctor whats happened to me
1318,my throats still sore
1319,no but i feel very giddy
1320,we must match cunning with cunning
1321,although we have tested the water already
1322,over here is a sample of the aqueduct water
1323,but all the water is the same
1324,but why were some of the districts negative
1325,i wear your sash of office who is to know that i am not the second elder now bind him keep him here
1326,oh hes improving but he still seems to go back sometimes to that old state of confusion
1327,yes doctor
1328,ill send a messenger immediately
1329,when johns cured theres no quick antidote for him
1330,yes but youve discovered an antidote now
1331,enemies
1332,enemies yes making plots
1333,listen to john
1334,where are you going doctor
1335,yes i will have you conducted to the laboratory go with this servant and give my respects to the senior scientist
1336,all our attempts to light it end in failure for one reason or another
1337,we avoid this place we have no reason to go down to the aqueduct anyway
1338,shall we return now
1339,no you must not
1340,you will not be able to see
1341,there are monsters in there
1342,yes weve heard them
1343,no but they are there the noise is terrifying
1344,no im fine come on
1345,those look like claw marks strange they didnt reach your skin
1346,are you sure you didnt see it
1347,we didnt get the antidote i had to go all the way back to the laboratory and get some more
1348,yes surrounded by enemies
1349,dont you mean three
1350,all of us
1351,i wish you twod stop fussing over me
1352,its the second elder hes only got one sash
1353,yes
1354,that must have looked funny flip flap flip flap
1355,his behaviour is a mystery
1356,for the doctor
1357,very smart
1358,i met the second elder in the courtyard as he ordered me to i gave him the firing key of the disintegrator then i saw the doctor go after the second elder
1359,yes if he thought he got promotion because of us hed be a useful ally
1360,my new advisor and i have much to discuss you will excuse us
1361,then i accept
1362,well im ian and this is the doctor susans grandfather
1363,all that matters now is the present
1364,i wouldnt like to cross him
1365,left behind by the humans that were killed in the spaceship explosion
1366,oh look at these doctor family snapshots look
1367,one of the human beings was very interested in the aqueduct
1368,grandfather the first elder wants to talk to you
1369,this is only a sketch i can let you have a plan in detail if you need
1370,the city administrator of course
1371,yes he was certainly pretty odd with me
1372,its no use telling him stories about the second elder doctor weve got to give him proof
1373,look why dont you ask the first elder if we can have barbara down here again
1374,gentlemen be seated
1375,well sir the doctor and i have discussed this poison business and we are convinced that your water supply is being deliberately poisoned
1376,very well but you will take light with you and such arms as we can provide
1377,barbara
1378,ask it
1379,it will be arranged
1380,very simple to use doctor
1381,the range is considerable the ray paralyses up to a distance of thirty yards
1382,one hour
1383,and yet i do not envy you your adventure i still wish i could dissuade you
1384,i dont think she ought to doctor
1385,very well
1386,ah the map of the aqueduct
1387,well lets go and make an end of it doctor
1388,quite
1389,theres no doubt about it doctor the inside filaments been removed these weapons are useless
1390,well get out of here somehow doctor
1391,well whatevers out there hasnt attacked us yet
1392,doctor it was a man i know it was
1393,yes look this came away in the struggle
1394,why should they come here
1395,yes but why poison the water in the first place
1396,i think i will
1397,uncanny its so quiet
1398,youre a cheerful soul i must say
1399,doctor
1400,i know ive been trying to tell you
1401,you were right about the ambush werent you
1402,thats right  man 2 watch them number one  man 1
1403,the sensorites you mean  man 1
1404,no
1405,right ill lead
1406,lets hope they were made by the doctor thats all
1407,its very good of you to say so
1408,is that true
1409,well this is absolutely wonderful we nearly lost you know i had command of a fine spaceship very fine two of my men deserted pretended they had to go back to earth to get reinforcements
1410,oh you know about that do you you do realise this war has been fought by me and my men here any treasure trove is ours
1411,whats this who are these people
1412,well im glad the fightings over look forward to a bit of a rest now for a while
1413,come back here you men treachery
1414,treachery
1415,i could have killed him i wanted to but that would not be the way would it
1416,he could have destroyed the entire sensorite nation
1417,theyre coming
1418,i had a talk with the senior scientist just before we left it seems that the sensphere has an extraordinary number of ultra high frequencies so i wont be able to go on using thought transference
1419,when will we get back grandfather
1420,sometimes i feel id like to belong somewhere not just be a wanderer still im not unhappy
1421,well here we are
1422,we were saying goodbye to john and carol
1423,well at least they know where theyre going
1424,i didnt mean anything
1425,now doctor i never said that
1426,doctor we
1427,grandfather please
1428,do you have to be in such a hurry
1429,dont you see susan the longer we leave it the harder itll be
1430,yes were waiting for you to carry out the checks
1431,oh is it are you so certain you know where we are
1432,mmm it could be i suppose
1433,you know it reminds me of a holiday i once took in somerset
1434,look doctor i think itd be better if you came with us at least to explore
1435,yes and we met marco polo
1436,i know that of course youre in control youre always in control and im sure you could revisit us at any time

1485,now where were you digging
1486,heres another
1487,sacre bleu
1488,good evening citizen
1489,i was just about to close my humble shop but if i can be of service
1490,did you see the executions today citizen
1491,i missed them too most unusual citizen robespierre is doing a fine job dont you think hounding out the traitors
1492,i consider it my duty
1493,a wise choice citizen there is no finer set of apparel in all of paris
1494,yes it would certainly be more suitable than what youre wearing at present
1495,yes citizen it signifies the position of regional officer of the provinces
1496,i see im sorry citizen
1497,certainly citizen the quality is unmatched and in comparison the price
1498,no money
1499,for this
1500,nay its little better than a fancy dress outfit
1501,i agree
1502,you realise there is not much call for a
1503,never
1504,it is a heavy material i grant you and perhaps with a few alterations you are offering the entire outfit
1505,yes well i shall require something else too like that ring youre wearing for example
1506,very well
1507,yes thank you      doctor
1508,i am citizen
1509,we would have arrange an escort had we been advised of your
1510,robespierre why i dont think you should worry the first deputy citizen hes a very busy man i am at your service citizen anything you wish to know
1511,oh indeed citizen i am most conscientious but when youre assisted by idiots
1512,some wine citizen
1513,i would deem it a privilege if i could be of help
1514,ah yes ah yes er
1515,the women were dispatched to the guillotine unfortunately there was a rescue
1516,we dont know many times traitors have been snatched away on the road to the guillotine you understand of course that i cannot be held responsible
1517,they were outside my jurisdiction
1518,no well the man er well er
1519,he escaped he was a desperate fanatic citizen he gave me this wound i fought with him prepared to give my life to stop his escape but he fought with the strength of ten men
1520,exactly citizen exactly
1521,they will be caught you may rest assured
1522,i can read thank you jailer and where are you going now citizen
1523,its rather late it would perhaps be better if you journeyed tomorrow
1524,you see im taking the execution lists to the first deputys palace and by a coincidence if you like your province is going to be discussed it would be a great help if you were on hand to answer any difficult questions that crop up
1525,i see i am always prepared to listen to a firsthand account of a regions situation
1526,when did you arrive
1527,hardly long enough for you to have gauged the present mood of our capital
1528,i am only interested in your comments on your own territory recent memoranda from your province suggest that the purge of our enemies in your region is progressing very slowly
1529,we in paris are aware of the danger citizen we live in troubled times there is much much work to be done work that is constantly delayed by the need to ferret out the traitors that we harbour in our midst
1530,i think you have said enough citizen
1531,i could and i shall do great things for france for too long the nobility have kept our people to heel and now finally my world is at power what happens my colleagues my trusted friends plot for power
1532,danton planned to restore the monarchy i had the proof i knew i had to dispose of him and the girondins even now convention members are at work plotting my downfall but i will triumph even if i have to execute every last one of them death always death do you think i want this carnage three hundred and forty two executions in nine days in paris alone what a memory i shall leave behind if this thing lasts you must come again citizen we never did talk about your province
1533,no far from it id say you created a favourable impression on citizen robespierre
1534,politicians usually do still you are going to have another opportunity
1535,that would be rather difficult citizen robespierre is expecting you tomorrow
1536,on the contrary it would be more than my neck is worth to disobey such an order you must try and stay
1537,he will be staying at least until tomorrow night
1538,i trust the room will be to your satisfaction
1539,if youre ready citizen ill show you your room
1540,eh
1541,it doesnt matter about them
1542,citizen
1543,lemaitre said you are staying i must obey him
1544,im sorry citizen im sorry but he comes back and finds you gone it could be even worse
1545,good morning citizen i hope you slept well
1546,im sorry
1547,better feed the pigs
1548,citizen lemaitre thought you might like to question this prisoner
1549,doctor
1550,oh doctor i thought we were never going to see you again
1551,shes here we were arrested together
1552,yes
1553,yes shes fine she had a slight fever but shes recovered now
1554,oh i know where he is
1555,i know where he is
1556,oh i should never have taken susan to see that physician
1557,do you think we stand a chance of getting out of here
1558,yes well im not surprised in that getup
1559,are you serious
1560,what about susan
1561,but doctor you
1562,hes left to see citizen robespierre
1563,well im sure hell be back shortly citizen
1564,oh i see i see
1565,perhaps we should make her talk
1566,perhaps
1567,perhaps
1568,well if she were to escape she could be followed shed meet these traitors then wed arrest them lemaitre once did this
1569,oh but er
1570,what is it what do you want
1571,oh grandfather oh grandfather youve found us well howd you get away from the farmhouse
1572,oh barbaras here somewhere
1573,be careful
1574,didnt you collect the soldiers and follow the released prisoner
1575,but whatever why not
1576,i couldnt have gone i cant leave the prison
1577,no citizen
1578,it was mine citizen you must help me
1579,citizen lemaitre was very clear with his instructions if that door is opened i lose my head thats what what lemaitre said just before he left thats what he said
1580,aye well you must see him when he returns citizen im just a humble servant if his orders are countermanded well then
1581,oh grandfather i thought you were never coming
1582,grandfather
1583,be careful
1584,oh itll be the end of me this business i dont know what lemaitre will say
1585,oh but we expect him any minute and then
1586,what
1587,he did as you said e would citizen he tried to get the young girl released and he let the other prisoner go
1588,all right jailer i think its about time we had a talk
1589,im afraid youre not in a position to insist on anything at the moment
1590,not yet but i intend to find out do you recognise this citizen
1591,and these theyre yours arent they given in exchange for those rather splendid clothes and the insignia of a regional provincial deputy
1592,i could have had you arrested any time i wanted
1593,please please keep it why didnt i well with the political situation as it is and my position being what it is i need friends even if theyre enemies people i can call on for help if i have something on them so much the better
1594,i knew id never see you again if you did
1595,and left your granddaughter just an assumption but obviously correct i knew i had you so long as she remained here under lock and key if you remember when i first met you you were enquiring after your friends the young woman whom the jailer says youve just released the girl and what was his name ian
1596,lets just say i added to my knowledge listening at doors can still be effective
1597,ah so i see we understand each other if you agree to help me your granddaughter will be released after you have kept your side of the bargain
1598,good now im reasonably certain that your group are working with or for jules renan i think you used his hideout certainly you know where it is and if you dont your granddaughter does
1599,if you want your granddaughter released you will have to take me to his hideout
1600,no i came alone and unarmed ask your friend
1601,yes but i didnt know whether i could trust you there again i could have been overheard no ian i took the only course possible
1602,i know but let me explain my position
1603,she already has been out of that prison and she was rearrested i will help you if you will help me dont you see i can use my authority to get safe passage for all of you to wherever you want to go
1604,no harm will come to susan i promise i gave orders that she was to remain in the cell now you know thats true the jailer would die rather than see that cell door opened again
1605,barrass knows me by sight im sure of that he could even know of you doctor now my plan if you agree is for barbara and ian to attend the meeting
1606,its risky but were not going to get away without help
1607,he wont be content with that ive watched his promotions bonapartes clever and ambitious if he gets a foothold to power one day he will rule france
1608,it will happen
1609,doctor
1610,to the palace well get news of robespierre if youre not outside the prison when we return ill come for you
1611,take care ian
1612,oh i dont know yes i do its this feverish activity to try and stop something that we know is going to happen robespierre will be guillotined whatever we do
1613,yes i know you cant influence or change history i learnt that lesson with the aztecs
1614,yes its up to the doctor now
1615,yes we were lucky to find shelter so near the prison
1616,yes of course
1617,up with the revolution you you came back

1636,ian
1637,so do i but to where jules funny i get the impression they dont know where theyre heading for come to that do any of us

1639,and what are we going to see and learn next doctor
1640,which one
1641,ow
1642,ive burnt myself its hot

1648,are you all right
1649,what happened just then
1650,well at least we seem to be all right
1651,but what does it mean look you neednt keep it a secret from us
1652,doctor dont keep us in suspense
1653,no we cant thats just it
1654,you mean something went out of the ship
1655,came inside
1656,how could we youve never explained it to us
1657,grandfather everythings all right there isnt a fault anywhere not even a yellow standby
1658,well the doors have never opened like that before
1659,theres nothing to forgive
1660,perhaps you need a new tube doctor
1661,yes it was like an internal explosion of some sort
1662,yes
1663,what do we do now doctor take the scanner out and strip it down
1664,well we must go outside and look you said it was quite safe
1665,shall i open the doors grandfather
1666,doctor what made the doors open before
1667,its like a vine or something
1668,perhaps that was the only damage to the ship doctor overloading on the scanner circuits
1669,there are two different types of rock doctor look this is ordinary stone up here but this down here seems to be quite different
1670,it might be
1671,yes very rough they look like pebbles of sand dont they
1672,id have thought the stone was heavy enough to keep itself in place
1673,yes all right but stay within calling distance and if you see anything sing out well do the same
1674,doctor doctor its a huge snake
1675,lets call the others
1676,thats a fantastic size
1677,interesting
1678,doctor are you sure it isnt just sleeping
1679,yes look at these eggs scattered about the other ants must have been frightened away i wonder what sort of a world could produce an insect that size
1680,what
1681,youre right there arent
1682,its a bit like a maze really all these channels wed better be careful not to get lost
1683,what mystery
1684,yes it is susan this means were on earth something very odd here first those ants now this i suppose it couldnt be part of a crazy exhibition you know where everything had been increased in size
1685,yes fine
1686,hey look at the end of that its all charred
1687,it certainly looks like one
1688,what that size
1689,smaller
1690,an inch
1691,susan whats the matter
1692,all right susan its all right
1693,all right ill do it

1697,i dont know how you know but do you suppose he could have
1698,well look doctor give us some hope i mean ians inside that matchbox
1699,grandfather supposing the man walks off with it
1700,and then can you get us back to normal size
1701,dont move
1702,dont touch it
1703,it could still sting
1704,none at all
1705,well i havent taken my eyes off it grandfather it hasnt even trembled i think youre right it is dead
1706,well that must be whats killing them then
1707,doctor whatever it is thats killing these things could it kill us too
1708,thats not thunder surely
1709,seen a lot more of those dead ants doctor
1710,oh dear i wonder what would have happened to us if any of those creatures had still been alive
1711,oh not any further please im exhausted its taken us ages to get here
1712,yes whats happening here
1713,and everything else is the same here
1714,what would kill insects in a perfectly ordinary garden i mean pests one can understand but surely its wrong to bees and worms and things isnt it
1715,argh grandfather    episode two  dangerous journey
1716,doctor i think the cats losing interest
1717,couldnt we make contact with the people here somehow
1718,well why not they might be able to help us
1719,oh thats a thought isnt it
1720,oughtnt we to do something about it
1721,well i cant see any sign of that cat for how much safety that gives us
1722,grandfather they were almost stepped on
1723,shall we go over to them
1724,its much better when theyre a long way away isnt it
1725,well i definitely saw him pick up the briefcase when he walked past us it was just like a mountain just a blur you know he must have gone inside the house careful grandfather dont fall down there will you
1726,phew yes its not just an ordinary drainpipe is it
1727,are you thinking of climbing up the inside of it
1728,its too far for you grandfather
1729,all right but you let me go first
1730,well maybe but the other things are much more important    susan
1731,grandfather grandfather grandfather we made it we got to the top
1732,come on
1733,oh yes grandfather i think i heard some people talking just now i heard a sort of low growling sound like ian said you know
1734,yeah i think we should try and find them dont you do you think theres a chance of them being here somewhere
1735,i dont know coming from over here
1736,how far can we expect our voices to carry
1737,well if we shout very loudly would the people here hear us
1738,there they are can you see them barbara doctor susan were up here
1739,oh grandfather we found them
1740,all right let me go first

1742,theres a sink in the lab
1743,oh quick grandfather
1744,the doctor and susan are still in that sink barbara and hes turned the tap on
1745,oh at least were safe here

1747,i dont believe it
1748,do you think its the formula for the insecticide doctor
1749,yes all right
1750,those things up there are definitely molecular structures
1751,im afraid its far too heavy wed never lift it
1752,yes
1753,yes im not very well up in this doctor but isnt that phosphoric acid
1754,yes and this is mineral nitrate thats about as far as i go im afraid
1755,what about human beings
1756,yes if they drink and eat infected food and water
1757,well then why do we go on just sitting here
1758,yes i feel a bit giddy i think i must be hungry
1759,yes well the less we talk about food the more ill like it
1760,well no need for all of us to go ill go and fetch some
1761,well whats that
1762,hmm its climbable
1763,and doctor pass this up to susan and she can then pass it on up to me

1852,doctor i dont understand this at all we saw the daleks destroyed on skaro we were there
1853,i see they certainly look different dont they

1913,and you think if it was something on the surface theyd have just collected it and gone
1914,but isnt that impossible i mean without causing an eruption a huge earthquake no one could survive

2231,doctor if you feel that
2232,just another dreary old statue
2233,oh the poor man
2234,its a lonely stretch of road maybe he was set upon by robbers they did happen in this time didnt they
2235,maybe they didnt have time
2236,doctor ive seen him before he was playing in the square when barbara and i went to the market
2237,be careful
2238,why yes i am
2239,what do you mean
2240,is that your lyre
2241,no no only if it is yours
2242,why its you im looking for
2243,you must be maximus pettulian from corinth whose skill as a musician is talked of even in rome
2244,we expected you in assessium yesterday when you failed to arrive i sent my men out to search for you i count it my good fortune that ive personally found you unharmed
2245,all roads to rome are dangerous for travellers when you sent word that you intended to make your way on foot playing your lyre for the people it caused great concern at court
2246,caesar neros court the emperor of all rome is very concerned for your safe arrival he looks forward to discussing your music with you
2247,then if youre ready well travel to assessium and then my men will escort you the rest of the way
2248,doctor i know this
2249,listen i know hes mistaken you for that man but we cant go with him
2250,but doctor you dont even know your own name
2251,maximus pettulian if youre ready
2252,nero pays well when better musicians than he are put out of the way and you failed you fool but youre lucky this time i brought him back here so you have another chance to earn your fee take it maximus pettulian is in the room above fail me again and youll lose more than your tongue     doctor
2253,doctor whats happening
2254,youre all right then
2255,i realise youre a man of many talents doctor but i didnt know fighting was one of them
2256,the what

2258,oh doctor i was coming to tell you another thing you know the centurion who brought us here he seems to have gone too
2259,pettulian
2260,pettulian
2261,but doctor if he wanted you dead why didnt he take care of it himself
2262,yes but if you were going to be killed anyway i cant see that it
2263,ah so he must have been looking in the bushes for the body when we first met him
2264,you dont mean to say were going on
2265,but they might try and kill you again
2266,isnt it wonderful doctor can we explore

2343,well obviously you must leave here before this concert
2344,so if you still intend to carry on with your plan today is your last chance to kill nero
2345,maximus when you first sent word from corinth of your intention to murder the caesar nero i informed your allies in the court
2346,then when the assassins left here to waylay you on your journey naturally i thought that was the end
2347,yes maximus you arrived here
2348,yes yes we all know that but my main concern now maximus is that you should act on what i say
2349,good good good and the lions will go hungry after all eh

2526,doctor
2527,it is danger that is always with us poidarac it is well try down there    vrestin
2528,will it work doctor
2529,our legends of it only begin when it was already thinking itself into the crannies of vortis and the minds of the zarbi spreading its web
2530,is there is power in the magnetic pole of the planet that is where the web has its centre
2531,yes doctor their theory would would explain the new moons that have appeared in the sky they too are drawn here by this power
2532,doctor do you intend to go ahead with the plan
2533,how different

2538,doctor have we got to
2539,doctor
2540,i wondered if we could borrow this creature i think he would be very useful in our attack
2541,i have made a study of the zarbi i think i could make use of him
2542,please i have no wish to offend but you don�t know the zarbi as i do
2543,is anything wrong
2544,a small matter

2594,humour is he delirious
2595,look on the brighter side my lord a troop of men to capture one of your knights why hed need an army by itself and more to take your horse or every man he has or more to take you prisoner
2596,there is a jest here albeit a grim one with our friends dead but saladin must be just as much out of temper over this affair as we are
2597,we think we value sir william highly we do but it would not be good to let saladin know
2598,by my fathers name you have wit old man guard call the chamberlain we recognise the service you have rendered us and will be pleased to see you in our court
2599,this is a young man
2600,we must do something about your clothes at least

2602,your way is open to the sultans brother
2603,why have i got to put this lot on

2630,you say you are grateful i cannot command what i ask of you now nor will i but i am in some quandary
2631,i am my brothers favourite yet now i find i am excluded from his confidence i sense hes made a plan of which i am a part
2632,theres something new in you yet something older than the sky itself i sense that i can trust you
2633,a girl dressed as a boy is nothing understandable these days the dresses silk satins wheres the money to come from
2634,thank goodness for that i didnt really see myself as a veritable strutting peacock
2635,how do you mean in one way
2636,ill still see you wont i
2637,i mean barbaras gone off and then ian
2638,you wouldnt go off and leave me would you
2639,i mean your ships the only home ive got now and i couldnt bear it if
2640,well when you said a good thing in one way i thought well i thought you meant that i was some sort of problem or something
2641,not this time no my lord of leicester no weve had another thought to give our sisters hand in marriage to saphadin brother of the sultan and so make an end to this war
2642,we do not feel obliged to explain anything to anyone my lord of leicester we think our words were plain enough
2643,joanna knows nothing of this matter
2644,sire with all the strength at my command i urge you sire to abandon this pretence of peace
2645,i speak as a soldier why are we here in this foreign land if not to fight the devils horde saracen and turk posses jerusalem and we will not wrest it from them with honeyed words
2646,aye with swords and lances or the axe
2647,youre a man for talk i can see that you like a table and a ring of men a parley here arrangements there but when you men of eloquence have stunned each other with your words we we the soldiers have to face it out on some halfstarted morning while you speakers lie abed armies settle everything giving sweat sinewed bodies aye and life itself
2648,youve been very kind to me
2649,do you have news for me
2650,but you were with my brother did he tell you nothing of his plans
2651,i thought i had your friendship
2652,cant you tell her
2653,but cant you drop her a hint or something shes furious we cant afford to make an enemy of her
2654,who gave away my plan
2655,oh where is the princess she knew all about this
2656,i wish to question her
2657,no more will we
2658,we know now that it was not you who told our sister its no use joanna is right we cannot fight rome as well in any other land i could command the end and force my purpose not here not with saphadin and joanna no once again we shall have to fight
2659,we accept the impeachment we are unjust to you to serve the greater good you see my lord of leicester is a hardy fighter and a fight is near us now when we meet the saracen again we shall need him at our elbow but do not be discouraged you have our favour
2660,yes i fear you have therefore it would be best to be gone from here until the enmity is forgotten
2661,good and we do not wish to see you leave but you must go to acre rest there wait until we call again upon your wisdom and your counsel
2662,meantime ill wrestle with the problem of this war
2663,win the battle lose the war the greatest fear we have weve come so close i must see jerusalem i must
2664,you think so
2665,are we going back to the ship
2666,doctor will he really see jerusalem
2667,thats terrible cant we tell him
2668,they can still use their legs cant they
2669,are these the soldiers who followed us
2670,can we go round
2671,why not whats happening
2672,the shadows are the only friends they have well find them at daybreak
2673,hold hold
2674,so i thought youd show yourself
2675,yours is the greater claim dispatch him then and quickly
2676,granted
2677,granted
2678,hurry doctor hurry
2679,any more cracks about knighthood and ill carry out that execution
2680,yes and where it likes
2681,whats happening
2682,doctor we�ve got our clothes on
2683,no doctor our ordinary everyday clothes
2684,doctor you can�t dismiss it like that we were standing here in thirteenth century clothes we can�t suddenly
2685,but doctor where are the clothes we were wearing
2686,all right i will
2687,okay
2688,i dare say it does doctor but we�d be a lot happier if you would explain it to us
2689,no more like a launching pad to me maybe it�s a dumping ground
2690,well there isn�t any sign of life look there�s a building what do you make of that doctor
2691,you mean you want to go and have a closer look eh
2692,safe well the readings don�t always tell us everything you know
2693,yes doctor
2694,doctor it doesn�t have to be it all came together again and jumped up into my hand well if you don�t believe me you can go and look there hasn�t been time to clear it up yet
2695,with the water in it
2696,a space museum yes
2697,oh well someone must be in charge of them
2698,hey doctor come here and have a look at this
2699,dead
2700,yes
2701,well maybe it�ll get colder as it gets dark
2702,yes
2703,oh er yes doctor
2704,doctor
2705,we�re walking on dust several inches thick i�d say
2706,then why aren�t we leaving any footprints
2707,no windows either
2708,maybe there isn�t anybody
2709,well everything�s peculiar
2710,more and more like a graveyard
2711,there�s someone coming
2712,where
2713,i know
2714,well there aren�t any windows
2715,yes but i don�t understand where the light comes from
2716,except that there are no little men following you about telling you not touch things
2717,well everything seems quite normal
2718,those two men we saw must have been guards who started all this do you think doctor
2719,so that�s what a dalek looks like
2720,we were there vicki that was one of the periods we visited
2721,you wouldn�t say that young lady if ever we meet them again which to say the least is very unlikely i hope
2722,they were talking
2723,what do you think doctor
2724,doctor doctor
2725,i touched that thing and
2726,all right doctor you can save the scolding till later look can�t you see that vicki�s upset
2727,see there isn�t anything there is there
2728,yes of course we can vicki
2729,well where can we hide doctor what shall we do
2730,what do you make of that
2731,that one looked straight at me
2732,and he was talking his lips were moving
2733,right we�re invisible that settles it
2734,well how can we find the answer in here
2735,oh same as all the others i suppose
2736,i�ve had enough of this place doctor
2737,well here surely
2738,that�s us that�s not models or pictures that�s us
2739,time like space although a dimension in itself also has dimensions of its own
2740,well at least it explains what�s been happening to us
2741,and nobody can see us i see
2742,is there anyway of getting out of this doctor
2743,how simple
2744,i beg your pardon
2745,i see i think
2746,doctor look why don�t we go and find the tardis the real one i mean and get into it and get out of here now
2747,doctor when will we arrive
2748,well how will we know when we have arrived i mean
2749,and from that moment we�ll be in great danger
2750,doctor
2751,they�ve gone
2752,all right hey i wonder if it works hey
2753,doctor i might have shot a hole right in the middle of you
2754,we must break the chain of events that led up to it and going out of here might be just what we�re not supposed to do
2755,that�s a good point doctor
2756,yes i see it�s a difficult problem isn�t it
2757,there�s no answer but doctor we�ve got to decide on something
2758,oh so i have
2759,doctor why do you always show the greatest interest in the least important things
2760,james watt
2761,doctor i�d just come face to face with myself i wasn�t counting the buttons on my jacket
2762,yes
2763,yes well which way have you any particular fancy
2764,and which way was that
2765,well actually all the doors and corridors are exactly alike
2766,doctor it depends which way you�re facing before you start turning at all
2767,doctor why don�t you admit it you are just as lost as the rest of us
2768,oh no i�m not i remember that thing being over there
2769,you do well which way do we go
2770,straight ahead
2771,well if we keep going we must eventually come to an entrance
2772,doctor
2773,oh we�ll have to take our chance this time otherwise the moroks will get them first come on
2774,very well mine is lobos i am the governor of this planet
2775,ah so now you choose to speak good yes xeros is a museum a lasting memorial to the achievements of the morok civilisation
2776,people tire of their heritage three hundred mimmians ago sightseers filled this planet marvelling at what they saw today the occasional spaceship from morok calls
2777,you have a sense of humour too unfortunately that is not the reason our civilisation rests on its laurels galactic conquests are a thing of the past life it is now said is purely a thing to enjoy
2778,why do you come here
2779,oh then you are a scientist like myself it makes a change to have someone intelligent and enquiring to talk to
2780,where have you come from
2781,where have you come from
2782,what are these creatures
2783,but these are amphibious creatures you are not an amphibian
2784,you fools you let them escape all available divisions priority search these aliens must be found at once maximum security
2785,good we shan�t have long to wait
2786,get back
2787,how are you feeling
2788,you�ve been cold all right doctor i can tell you that
2789,that�s an order
2790,eh
2791,now
2792,yes his conscience did need reminding
2793,what do you mean you know surely you were
2794,you mean you knew everything that was happening
2795,i wouldn�t be too sure of that doctor of course i have no proof but your brain could very easily have been affected
2796,what�s the problem surely we�ve changed the future by now
2797,yes that�s true
2798,in due course they will go into the museum as planned
2799,well exhibits in a forgotten museum eh is that how we�re all going to end up not with this apparatus
2800,well you can�t blame ian for letting off steam doctor oh i wish i�d had thought of it i�d have smashed the whole thing too
2801,must we vicki or were all the things that happened planned out for us four separate journeys four choices that led all the time closer to here maybe it could have changed things if i hadn�t left that museum
2802,it hasn�t happened yet you know
2803,it�s only a matter of time isn�t it doctor
2804,but doctor what can we do now to
2805,that�s what i was trying to say doctor
2806,you mean we don�t necessarily have to change our own future it could be changed for us
2807,oh marvellous oh thank you
2808,no well it must be quite a feeling getting your own planet back
2809,just that
2810,yes i have i think most people have
2811,ah well thanks very much for explaining it
2812,yes well do you want it back
2813,yes
2814,oh we only want on xeros what belongs to xeros vicki the rest will be broken up
2815,doctor what is that extraordinary thing you�ve got in the tardis
2816,a souvenir ha couldn�t you get something a little smaller
2817,oh no doctor of course you don�t but er what is it it looks terribly interesting
2818,yes doctor but what exactly does it do
2819,yes thank you doctor your party made our revolution a success

2826,doctor what is this machine
2827,yes but apart from making that dreadful noise what does it do
2828,oh wonderful ive always wanted one
2829,im sorry doctor but you rattle off explanations that would have baffled einstein and you expect barbara and i to know what youre talking about
2830,the energy radiated by a light neutron is equal to the energy of the mass it absorbed
2831,its quite simple it just means that anything that ever happens anywhere in the universe is recorded in light neutrons
2832,yes like that
2833,doctor youre kidding why didnt you tell me i could have fixed it for you instead of you fiddling about like that
2834,oh all right

2863,yes and we must warn ian and vicki they dont even know the daleks are here

2865,they are flesh eaters
2866,of course
2867,do you think they are near or far
2868,it is to be exploded
2869,no we would not reach the airlock in time
2870,we have arrived this is the gate to our city
2871,this old airlock we used it when our city was beneath the sea it will take us to a part of our home that is still free from mire beasts
2872,no matter first you need food and rest then we will help you search for your time machine
2873,please enter there is no danger
2874,doctor how can you sit there eating when ian and
2875,yes i do
2876,im sorry this place gives me the creeps
2877,you enjoyed your meal
2878,it led to a part of our city thats been invaded by mire beasts
2879,it is the same all over we have to block off tunnels to stop their advance do please sit down i have some news for you
2880,the leader of the daleks has communicated with us they have issued an ultimatum
2881,we hand you over to them or they will destroy what remains of our city
2882,not yet the elders are still discussing it we have a halfsun in which to give them our answer
2883,no no no the daleks have said that we must hand you over not set you free to try and escape
2884,you must be our prisoners until such time as our arrangements with the daleks have been completed then if the elders agree you will be given into their custody      dalek 1
2885,yes whats happened
2886,yes
2887,have you eaten
2888,we have no choice the elders have so decreed please

2936,oh we havent done very well so far doctor have we lets face it first of all we land on top of a skyscraper now we land on a crummy old ship what we need is space
2937,yes
2938,barbaras got a case of call of the sea
2939,vicki any change doctor
2940,but surely weve got our twelve minute lead still
2941,oh charming

2947,what have you found now
2948,doctor i think wed better check on barbara and vicki
2949,must you id really rather not know
2950,it died a slow and painful death when those bats came out of the rafters
2951,oh theres one thing about this place doctor it certainly stimulates the phagocytes the phago you know its uncanny strange and weird but it is familiar
2952,oh did you i didnt notice you standing around to check your premonition
2953,what are you talking about now
2954,with one vital difference doctor this house is real it exists
2955,then were safe
2956,but the daleks cant touch us here not in the human mind
2957,where are those girls doctor well we would have seen them if they were upstairs hadnt we better take another look down there
2958,afraid so
2959,do not move
2960,vicki
2961,this game of hide and seek through time is wearing a little thin now
2962,what an extraordinary place more spooks to the square mile than the tower of london you know that theory of yours
2963,and were the daleks lodging too
2964,well hows this box of tricks coming along doctor
2965,whens it going to be operational eh
2966,oh doctor we cant go on like this can we weve given them the slip once or twice but sooner or later were going to have to settle with them
2967,here we are
2968,thanks
2969,wheres vicki
2970,tardis hello tardis come in please over  hello tardis doctor somebody please help me get me out of this tardis tardis
2971,isnt there anything we can do is there no way of going back for vicki
2972,weve never stayed long enough in any one place to repair the time mechanism of the tardis if we did is there a chance of going back for vicki
2973,but doctor if we all worked together if ian and i helped you surely its worth a try
2974,the dalek time machine of course doctor ive got it we cant go back for vicki in the tardis but we can in the daleks own time machine
2975,its the only chance weve got otherwise well never see vicki again
2976,what do you say doctor
2977,tardis somebody hear me tardis tardis     dalek 2
2978,yes well we wont have long to explore doctor before the daleks arrive so lets get moving
2979,yes just as though it were alive
2980,what is it doctor
2981,ah a living fungoid doctor
2982,it stings
2983,what does it matter so long as they stay on
2984,hey come over here look look you see the lights they form a sort of
2985,corridor
2986,doctor this could be an ideal place to fight those daleks
2987,yep fine
2988,yes let me go first
2989,no nothing its empty
2990,strange place now why would anyone construct a complicated system of lights to lead directly to a cave like this
2991,well what do you make of that doctor
2992,ah its designed to scare off those fungoid things we saw in the swamp
2993,as they come down the flare path we can pick them off one by one
2994,but doctor the daleks will find this flare path and well be trapped here
2995,lets put the lights out
2996,good where ah
2997,doctor that noise it was
2998,about another twenty yards doctor i think
2999,barbara barbara weve found her barbara where is she
3000,im sorry i behaved like that but when i first woke up i thought you must be the robot
3001,there is a robot the daleks made it exactly like you
3002,every detail i heard them giving it orders they made it to infiltrate our group they told it to infiltrate and kill
3003,theyve got her barbara barbara barbara
3004,dont just stand there chesterton thats the robot
3005,then prove it my dear fellow prove it then we shall all believe you
3006,you mean you cant
3007,put that stick down
3008,and if i wont
3009,you still you insist youre the real doctor
3010,this is the robot this is the robot
3011,things dont look too good do they doctor
3012,oh weve got one consolation were all together again
3013,why dont you go down and have a rest go on ill stay out here
3014,no you know its been dark ever since we landed on this planet

3017,yes you bet
3018,ill get it
3019,over there theres two more of them come on vicki quick
3020,doctor that was a foolish thing to do
3021,yeah its a lift
3022,look at it
3023,oh not bad eh
3024,why not its clean its comfortable the robots seem quite friendly
3025,like what
3026,from earth that couldnt have happened i worked out the odds two thousand to one against hey i supposed they realised i was on my way back when well who won the wars look im steven taylor flight red fifty
3027,this is the doctor
3028,well this is great i mean its ridiculous im lost for words i thought if ever i met anyone again i wouldnt stop talking for a week
3029,well yes apart from those fungus things
3030,fifty years ago but surely these robotsd be worn out by now theyd have run down
3031,now whats this what are they playing at
3032,look im with you of course but what happens when we get down to the ground
3033,your spaceship is it serviceable
3034,you coming doctor
3035,there arent any were allowed to go up here anytime for light exercise there are no guards
3036,go on ill show you
3037,see i told you no guards ill go and tell the girls
3038,doctor what do you make of this
3039,doctor ive got it we can get down to the ground with this
3040,well theres a junction box over here a few good pulls thisd come away come on lets get the others
3041,im not very good on heights
3042,well that settles it
3043,on the roof quick
3044,i think weve fused it
3045,ian
3046,theyre fine now vicki remember the doctors device well it worked the citys on fire look you can see
3047,yes im fine
3048,what for
3049,doctor its empty youve done it again youve beaten them
3050,dont waste it on him kiss me instead
3051,its huge inside you know just like the tardis
3052,shall i show you round
3053,yes home i want to sit in a pub and drink a pint of beer again i want to walk in a park and watch a cricket match above all i want to belong somewhere do something instead of this aimless drifting around in space
3054,well you havent been very successful have you
3055,oh doctor stop it
3056,look i know we thrust ourselves upon you but weve through a great deal together since then and all weve been through will remain with us always itll probably be the most exciting part of my life look doctor were different people and now we have a chance to go home we want to take that chance will you help us work that machine
3057,doctor doctor youve got to let them go if they want to they want to be back in their own time
3058,what for what would i want to be back in their time for i want to be with you doctor youve got to help them
3059,but its up to them
3060,please doctor
3061,doctor they made it they made it
3062,i shall miss them doctor
3063,ian and barbara
3064,what about the control panel
3065,well they werent getting any younger were they
3066,youre different doctor anyway we may land in their time one day and be able to talk over old times
3067,anyway its done now i wonder where the tardisll take us next
3068,you know i wouldnt mind new york i didnt get to see a lot of it what with the daleks and everything but what i saw from the top of the empire state building i wouldnt mind going back there
3069,oh sorry
3070,oh doctor i made my decision i wanted to stay anyway i wouldnt have anything to go back to
3071,did you hear that
3072,should have i never stopped say this is quite a ship youve got here doc never seen anything like it
3073,yes yes whatever you say doctor
3074,doctor he says the tardis isnt a time machine
3075,tell him
3076,look doctor ive seen some spaceships in my time admittedly nothing like this well what does this do
3077,youll see youll see
3078,yes
3079,where are we
3080,its a long way to the beach and back what about your meal
3081,just down there i saw it as soon as i came out of the ship
3082,oh maybe
3083,look it could just as easily be part of a costume you know a toy left here by a child
3084,no more so than your theory though your ship is to say the least a little unusual
3085,if it is a time machine im not saying it is mind you but if it is shouldnt you know where we are you know your control panel
3086,not by any direct route lets go exploring now
3087,oh great doctor im all for that but there is one thing that bothers me
3088,well how come you chose such an unusual design for your ship a police telephone box is that right
3089,blend in
3090,howwhat
3091,if it landed on the beach against the cliffs itd take on the appearance of a large rock
3092,that is merely another technical hitch and the doctor will repair it one day anyway if were going to do any exploring we should do it now cos its going to get dark in a minute
3093,yeah but that could be miles itd be much quicker to go up here
3094,well go with you doctor
3095,but doctor you might get
3096,it would have been crushed against the rocks by now whatever it was
3097,mead
3098,no its not far from here its just at the top of the hill and when the winds in the right direction you can hear the monks much clearer as though theyre down in the village
3099,i er i hope you will forgive a womans harsh welcome we do fear strangers but were very happy to welcome a traveller not that we see many in this wild place im sure that when my husband returns hell insist that you stay the night and then you can rejoin your friends in the morning
3100,yes while there are fish in the sea one need never starve
3101,course there are bad things too
3102,not that weve seen much of them this year except for that one raid that was beaten off just north of here
3103,the king harold godwinson we received no help from him
3104,it was the beginning of the year
3105,oh ill get you more
3106,yes of course we are why do you ask
3107,oh please sit down and rest before the fire you must be tired after your journey forgive me i have things to do before wulnoth returns
3108,what what is it
3109,well at the top of the hill why whats the matter
3110,no the monastery itselfs been deserted for years and years and then several weeks ago a few monks must have moved back in
3111,ones been seen but never spoken to how does he know that
3112,are you going to the monastery
3113,if i know the doctor its not going to be as simple as that
3114,to meet your friends you mean
3115,i cant think how you missed them
3116,youve been my only visitor tonight but you dont know my husband and the men from the village have gone after the vikings
3117,oh no no not a fleet this was just a small band of men they must have come from one ship
3118,you speak of a fleet as though you knew it existed
3119,plans of a viking invasion
3120,so thats why harold godwinsons struck on forming an army our men have travelled south already to join it i thought it was william of normandys invasion across the channel not a viking invasion he feared
3121,the monk did you say the monk
3122,well wont you stay and have some venison
3123,all right all right im coming
3124,i thought id seen the last of you doctor
3125,the monk it must be you still say theres no point in going back to the monastery come on
3126,oh a man of violence im surprised at you
3127,the door i must go
3128,but if i dont go theyll get suspicious
3129,you open the door no doctor thats not a very good idea
3130,because youre not wearing the right sort of clothes
3131,dear me dear me what an untrusting nature you have my son
3132,im only trying to help whoever it is its probably as traveller knocking for shelter who else could it be doctor i must remind you this is a monastery a place of refuge sanctuary
3133,of course
3134,doctor it suits you
3135,silence you old fool
3136,ulf ulf
3137,oh ha ha ha you still here are you good all ive got to do now is take care of you your friend and the doctor oh by the way youll be please to know ive arranged the fires for your colleagues
3138,its a tardis the monks got a tardis  episode four  checkmate
3139,all right then theyre a signal for king hardrada and the viking fleet
3140,theyll think its a landing place theyll come in unsuspecting and then
3141,i know and according to this it was the monk who put him up to it and listen to this
3142,im sure youll approve doctor
3143,and who says so doctor its more fun my way i can make things happen ahead of their time
3144,yes indeed for instance do you really believe the ancient britons could have built stonehenge without the aid of my antigravitational lift
3145,mischief no no a master plan a master plan to end all master plans
3146,the whole course of history changed in one single swoop
3147,exactly doctor exactly of course obviously i dont have to remind you that the main reason william the conqueror won the battle of hastings was because king harold had to march to stamford bridge and defeat the vikings first
3148,thats right precisely a fresh army no desertions why king harold will kick william back to normandy before knows what happened its quite a plan eh
3149,you havent prevented it yet doctor
3150,i dont allow anybody in there
3151,treasure
3152,this horrible block of stone as you call it is a perfect saxon sarcophagus
3153,sarcophagus
3154,and more in keeping with the period i would say than a modern police box whats the matter doctor cant you repair your camouflage unit
3155,luck luck oh no theres no luck about it i couldnt have picked a better place for my headquarters than this a deserted monastery right on the coast gullible peasants who believe everything i say to them no doctor no i planned to materialise my ship right on this very spot disguised as a sarcophagus and here it is
3156,precisely theres nothing hit or miss about my machine
3157,why steven why is he planning to do it whats his reason
3158,doctor youre safe
3159,oh are we glad to see you doctor
3160,yes well we er
3161,is that later than yours doctor
3162,oh i forgot all about it
3163,doctor doctor
3164,we havent got a time machine any more
3165,well you know you know we left it on the beach
3166,doctor
3167,the tide came in
3168,well isnt that enough
3169,oh yes indeed doctor in fact this one is fitted with the automatic drift control
3170,precisely doctor by the way i tried to get into your police box but the door was locked what types yours doctor
3171,look i take it you both come from the same place doctor
3172,which questions
3173,i i want to improve things
3174,well for instance harold king harold i know hed be a good king there wouldnt be all those wars in europe those claims over france went on for years and years with peace the peopled be able to better themselves with a few hints and tips from me theyd be able to have jet airliners by 1320 shakespeared be able to put hamlet on television
3175,the play hamlet on television
3176,yes yes i was you see if i didnt then king

3243,i have to hear the report first
3244,this is a fight to the death for existence itself
3245,in which one of us will be obliterated
3246,yes so bad that it is conceivable that you too will be obliterated
3247,when a planet disintegrates nothing survives
3248,yes its in its last moments of life soon it will explode
3249,the rills told us that is why theyre repairing their spaceship so that they can escape
3250,women
3251,to fight to kill
3252,disgusting
3253,thats all ill say
3254,theyre going to have another go at the chumblies by the look of things
3255,they send the machines to tell us lies we do not wish to hear them
3256,its not good for my soldiers
3257,yes now it is sending its message fire
3258,my only intention was to scare it off weve succeeded to your places
3259,we will
3260,they might have been speaking the truth they might have meant it
3261,what do you mean
3262,yes but we have no way of proving
3263,very well i should be grateful if you would find out
3264,oh wait you cannot all go

3266,ill stay
3267,ill stay youll need steven anyway if you bump into the chumblies again
3268,can they get in doctor
3269,how do you know they arent
3270,trying something else by the look of it
3271,yes well are we going in or not doctor
3272,yes doctor
3273,well doctor will this planet explode
3274,weve got to get off the planet
3275,weve got to make that sure they do
3276,okay but weve got to get off here somehow
3277,why is that that the drahvins did say fourteen dawns
3278,whats that its got
3279,perhaps its just going to stand guard there
3280,but what
3281,doctor
3282,oh please doctor you all right
3283,yes fine thanks do you think its done any damage
3284,its all right doctor i think its just come to investigate
3285,yes theyve given up
3286,two dawns hmm
3287,well weve made it doctor you know this is a pretty strange kind of spaceship
3288,i was just saying that its a strange kind of spaceship oldfashioned
3289,yeah but its the metal i mean doctor you know well its inferior
3290,well what are you talking about doctor its you who stopped to fiddle around on the outside
3291,all right doctor
3292,oh doctor youre all right
3293,yes well wed have been a lot quicker if it hadnt been for the doc we got held up by a chumbley
3294,they didnt succeed
3295,it served its purpose
3296,we have to protect ourselves against the machines
3297,did you find out about this planet
3298,will it explode
3299,when
3300,doctor
3301,will you help us
3302,to capture the rill spaceship so that we can escape
3303,what do you mean
3304,because theyre evil you only have to see them to know evil
3305,why not
3306,well either the rills die or we do
3307,come on whats so impossible about it have you ever tried being friendly
3308,wed be pretty stupid not to
3309,you will not change your mind
3310,this is your last chance
3311,steven
3312,as soon as that well youll have to work quickly the rill spaceship is that way you will capture it for us
3313,im sure the doctor can cope with that
3314,do you want our help or dont you
3315,very well well keep him
3316,doctor come on what are you standing there for
3317,what you dont think they have night here at all
3318,two hours
3319,yes i do
3320,maybe their rays cant cut through metal or
3321,oh they dont even seem to have tried
3322,come on doctor you said we havent much time
3323,doctor well never get past those sentries
3324,doctor
3325,how are we going to get past them
3326,youre telling me it is
3327,yeah well with the time weve got you have to all that in ten minutes flat
3328,thats your answer
3329,doctor i thought
3330,didnt you see they only pick up sounds in front of them if we keep immediately behind them they wont know were there
3331,that was no risk i noted observed collated concluded and then i threw the rock
3332,are you sure you can manage
3333,get it charged three all guns must be perfect if any one is found defective the owner will be severely punished because soon now we will use them i maaga will see to it soon now we will break into the rills spaceship and the rills they will all be wiped out
3334,that must be their space ship over there
3335,it looks like a drill rig
3336,oil gas
3337,what on earth will we do if another one of those things comes out
3338,it looks very temporary to me
3339,it looks like some kind of air purifier
3340,no
3341,a chumbleyshaped corridor doctor
3342,this one is for the rills
3343,very faint though isnt it
3344,i dont know but i feel as though i ought to
3345,that smells getting stronger you know
3346,oh doctor i thought theyd heard us
3347,doctor i know what that smell is now
3348,do you think its a baby one
3349,doctor
3350,doctor hurry up
3351,never mind about that release these bars
3352,you dont know that for certain
3353,i think they want me to go with them
3354,but doctor that thing in there that thing looking out of the window what
3355,doctor im so scared
3356,all right but be quick
3357,doctor no dont do it doctor doctor
3358,oh good i thought i was going to be too late
3359,we were told your friend is in danger
3360,yes well answer him
3361,doctor theyre not deaf
3362,we are not deaf you know perhaps you will both come inside
3363,doctor if the rills wanted to harm us the chumbley could shoot us now
3364,going to repair the damage you have done
3365,they wont show themselves doctor
3366,because our appearance would not be pleasant to you
3367,it is best you do not see us
3368,power we must have power for launching our spaceship the suns are too weak to supply this power therefore by drilling we may find some in the ground
3369,you know about the explosion of this planet
3370,two dawns
3371,yes but the only power we find is a gas and that is of no use to us we have no means of converting it into the sunray power we need
3372,we were twelve eight of us died in the crash
3373,we have some
3374,whats that
3375,he still thinks the chumblies are dangerous you see doctor let me go and tell him
3376,stay there and die go outside and be killed by the machine or surrender
3377,doctor
3378,you cannot help him alone we will send two more chumbley machines with you
3379,go quickly the chumbley reports that the sounds are weakening
3380,no im coming with you
3381,listen we have captured these machines they do anything we tell them now watch come forward stop go back stop
3382,steven
3383,they nearly killed him in there come on lets get away from there in case they come out
3384,are you all right
3385,stop if you move at all we shall fire do not mistake our intention you will not interfere doctor please lead your party away
3386,doctor there cant be a lot of time left now is there
3387,yes we have but it will take some time to transfer the power of your ship to ours
3388,and were concerned for yours
3389,very well
3390,what is going on doctor
3391,what are you trying to do
3392,oh i see
3393,but you want me to stay here
3394,can i come with you doctor
3395,see you later steven
3396,then go and do not fail  drahvin 3
3397,its strange to think that at dawn all this will explode into nothing
3398,well its all fixed up here doctor any snags at the tardis
3399,oh good good
3400,is that the power being transferred
3401,how long will it take
3402,oh but this planets due to explode in less than five hours
3403,oh no
3404,in the position he has taken up he is in no danger continue doctor
3405,when we get nearer i will give you further orders come
3406,do not worry i am prepared for that
3407,oh
3408,look isnt it possible to charge any faster
3409,yes well were going to be lucky to get back to the tardis in time
3410,now you know what we look like
3411,we apologise for the glass partition but you will understand we must keep our atmosphere in here
3412,our appearance shocks you
3413,to the drahvins we are ugly so they become frightened
3414,yes what difference does it make what your form is
3415,doctor
3416,its the ammoniac gas escaping
3417,you had better return to the other chamber our atmosphere is not good for you
3418,goodbye
3419,and how long till the explosion
3420,no we will go that way head for the spaceship part of the building we must concentrate on that
3421,yes and when dawn comes this planet explodes like a bomb
3422,whats that what is it
3423,you are right doctor we are ready to disconnect
3424,enough to get us well out into space where we can recharge from a sun
3425,a chumbley will escort you back to your ship
3426,we will wait until you are safely there
3427,it will be painless merely putting itself out of action
3428,thank you we shall give you time to get clear before we take off now we are going goodbye we wish you well
3429,yes and weve got less than half an hour doctor
3430,there they go
3431,doctor
3432,can we see the disintegration on the scanner doctor
3433,oh
3434,oh
3435,ive hurt my ankle
3436,look at that planet i wonder whats going on there
3437,run achilles run run a little more before you die
3438,thats hardly surprising in the circumstances why do you suppose theyre fighting
3439,doctor be careful they look terribly fierce
3440,doctor you cant you know if you go out there by yourself youll g
3441,wouldnt it be better if i went
3442,zeus forgive me
3443,oh but in your name
3444,if zeus bids me to rise
3445,the father of the gods and ruler of the world
3446,achilles mightiest of warriors greatest in battle humblest of your servants
3447,hector prince of troy sent to hades for blasphemy against the gods of greece
3448,he threatened to trim your beard should you descend to earth
3449,if you had appeared to me in your true form i would have been truly blinded by your radiance it is well known that when you come amongst us you adopt many different forms
3450,to europa you appeared as a bull to leda as a swan to me in the guise of an old beggar
3451,oh but still your glory shines through
3452,oh stop you must not go
3453,forgive me father zeus i spoke hastily
3454,i must brave even the wrath of zeus and implore you to remain
3455,odysseus this is no prisoner
3456,not yet a prisoner you should have called for assistance lad we would not like to lose you come let us escort you homewards night might fall and find thee from thy tent
3457,i met him odysseus in single combat
3458,why there he stands and listens to your mockery
3459,the temple of zeus you say a trifle modest is it not for so powerful a god
3460,you shall not enter
3461,oh then will you not stay with us
3462,what you will to the grecian camp if indeed you be zeus we have need of your assistance now do not cower there lads zeus is on our side so agamemnon keeps insisting bear him up and let us carry him in triumph to the camp
3463,you shall have honour enough and maybe we shall have a little of the truth father zeus we await you we crave the pleasure of your company at supper and perhaps a tale or two of aphrodite
3464,then you shall tell why we find you lurking near our lines that should prove equally entertaining take him lads and two of you there take up this carrion
3465,who dares command odysseus well agamemnon is it you well we will not quarrel when we have a guest of such importance heres this old man claims to be our father zeus
3466,i have that honour
3467,he will be reprimanded if you are indeed who you say you are
3468,knowledge of what
3469,oh name one
3470,silence i will not have my wifes name banded about like that besides we have no way of checking on your slanderous assertions divinely inspired or no what do you advise
3471,i tell you agamemnon he has come to help us
3472,forgive him father zeus the man is a boor if you command me i will deal with him
3473,do you prophesy as much as that
3474,almost oh not another ten years
3475,yes that is so on the other hand if we dont kill you and you are a spy the same thing might happen i propose to place you under arrest
3476,a reverent arrest you must not be offended we shall enjoy the benefit of your experience and your advice and in return you will enjoy our hospitality
3477,do you know this man
3478,softly now allseeing zeus you see into our very hearts and know their secrets
3479,then is this man a spy
3480,shall he then be put to death
3481,now we have it on second thoughts you think we should release him to return to troy
3482,what sort of miracle would
3483,alas no more for once he spoke too loud for comfort and stammered on a knife but he speaks to me get you gone and wait for me thunder at the temple tomorrow did you say
3484,our weather is so unpredictable if there is no thunder on the plain i have a sword will serve for two as well as one your temple as you call it has disappeared
3485,well father zeus where is this temple of yours
3486,yes fling a thunderbolt or some such to rise to the occasion
3487,which temple is in troy therefore would we release you just so i for one have had enough
3488,are you quite sure vicki couldnt have dematerialised the tardis
3489,first of all myrmidons who are you
3490,so really you see we arrived in your time entirely by accident its just another miscalculation by the doctor
3491,well then what would you call it
3492,no one mentioned cutting throats
3493,i had i had something more lingering in mind
3494,no no it isnt release but on certain conditions
3495,that you use your supernatural knowledge to devise a scheme whereby we capture troy i will give you two days two days to think of something really ingenious
3496,why not the wooden horse
3497,yes well if you say so doctor but in that case hurry up and think of something else the only way we can rescue vicki is to get into troy weve only got two days left
3498,rather less now havent you thought of anything yet
3499,oh really i dont see how youre going to enforce them but what are they
3500,i hope she is for her sake because if she left it shes past worrying about now
3501,to get vicki after all im no use here im sure the doctor can manage very well without me
3502,now then doctor to work i hope youre not going to disappoint me
3503,its been done what we want is something revolutionary
3504,well doctor you have one day left what progress are you making
3505,what is it
3506,looks like a parchment dart to me my boy makes these to annoy his tutors
3507,huh
3508,i suppose so what good would that be
3509,how would we get them into the air
3510,catapults that sounds like a vulgar oath to me i must try it on agamemnon catapults
3511,i see
3512,it begins to smell
3513,what happens
3514,yes well heres one soldier whos doing nothing of the sort
3515,that might be quite an idea
3516,agamemnon wouldnt do it though
3517,hed object most strongly well have to think of someone else
3518,im very glad to hear you say that doctor because i intend to build this flying machine
3519,will you keep still
3520,well think sitting down now you said your plans were ready ive got half a company of men standing by to make this machine of yours
3521,what you have very little time left doctor
3522,you mean youre too frightened to fly it yourself
3523,a mistake
3524,wasnt he now well that seems to me a great shame now if your machine wont work doctor i propose to fly you without it
3525,simply this that my catapult is ready and it seems a great pity to waste it now you have failed me therefore you are expendable i propose to fire you over the walls of troy
3526,it had better be well
3527,is that supposed to be funny
3528,what good would that be
3529,and its just possible that the trojans will come out and take the horse back into the city
3530,well what is this idea of yours
3531,go on
3532,well then what do we do
3533,excellent now that is a good idea
3534,why is there always a catch in it
3535,my ithacans and the doctor of course
3536,it is now ive just thought of it im standing no more nonsense from you doctor
3537,youd better not do that now the rest is up to those trojans they see that we have gone they see their great horse upon the plain which has descended from heaven to drive us away
3538,are you sure suppose they set fire to it
3539,well doctor thats a warhorse and a half for you thats something like a secret weapon better than half a dozen of your crackbrained flying machines
3540,oh whats the matter with you have you no faith in your own invention
3541,well they havent got to last forever after all were not building one of the wonders of the world are we as long as that horse gets us into troy it can collapse into a mares nest for all i care
3542,then we shall all look very foolish indeed
3543,i told you strongarm tactics wouldnt work
3544,what is it now doctor upon my soul youre making me as nervous as a bacchante at her first orgy why dont you try and get some sleep
3545,i hope you did thats the whole point of the operation is it not pretty lot of fools wed look if we come here and nobody takes a damned bit of notice of us
3546,well thats just as well youre the last of the greeks now your friends have all sailed home without you well come on
3547,that includes you doctor
3548,theyre just bringing the horse into the city follow me
3549,be happy thats all you have to worry about of all the undignified ways of entering a city this takes the fried phoenix
3550,zeus be praised weve arrived
3551,no thank you
3552,i was thinking doctor that with any luck either agamemnon or achilles will not come through
3553,no die just a hope one less finger in the pie a greater share of the booty for me
3554,nonsense its the reason that ive been here for ten long years fighting all the time
3555,you cant
3556,yes yes but as i happen to be sitting on the rope youll fall forty feet and break your neck
3557,im very glad i did doctor up to now its been very satisfactory
3558,be quiet old man
3559,doctor oh doctor
3560,doctor hes over there but ive got to talk to you
3561,youre from the other place
3562,katarina go and find diomede he will be there bring him to my temple quickly

3652,then weve won
3653,why not
3654,what
3655,that can only be found on the planet uranus a full measure would take years to mine
3656,that is taranium
3657,funny it makes your eyes feel strange even with these on its like looking into the sun for too long
3658,all right doctor but now that weve got it what are we going to do with it
3659,that doesnt make sense i mean you said yourself that the daleks have the most dangerous weapon ever devised
3660,come off it doctor whats all that supposed to mean
3661,look doctor im sorry but cant we do anything
3662,yes doctor here
3663,what tapes that
3664,everything is so strange this isnt like your tardis
3665,yes but doctor surely i mean the daleks arent going to leave a tape around with their plans on it
3666,marc cory you found him well kurt and i searched that jungle but we could find no trace
3667,how do you mean
3668,yes but we were methodical or as methodical as the daleks
3669,poor marc he never got through
3670,operate randomiser
3671,whats happening
3672,i cant were picking up speed
3673,desperus
3674,desperus is the penal planet of the solar system
3675,theyre arent any the only craft which stop there are prison ships bringing other criminals if we crash there well be left there to rot for the rest of our lives away
3676,were going to be able to make a soft landing i dont understand it
3677,daleks well its some sort of remote control i suppose wed all better prepare for landing
3678,if its the daleks it can only mean one thing
3679,certain its safety regulations
3680,doctor what are you talking about this is a spar the most technically perfect craft in the history of space travel
3681,oh come on doctor the tardis isnt exactly perfect is it i mean you cant even control wheres were going
3682,weve got to now as the doctor said lets get on with it
3683,there are lights out there
3684,come on doctor
3685,what
3686,its there
3687,under there
3688,what are you doing
3689,there doctor something moved
3690,what do you think youre playing at
3691,but cactic power isnt strong enough to kill anyone
3692,you show me so many strange mysteries with you i know im safe
3693,were being as quick as we can
3694,doctor did you close the outer door
3695,its all right it doesnt matter
3696,next stop earth
3697,do you realise
3698,keep back
3699,not earth go to the planet kembel
3700,so
3701,destroy pursuit ship they have failed in their mission we will not tolerate mistakes
3702,well open the door from the control panel ill rush him
3703,yes ive turned on the talkback
3704,we cant seem to get through to him hes crazy
3705,now thats just for starters do as i say
3706,now thats more like it
3707,yes and us
3708,she pressed the wrong button doctor
3709,it must have been quick
3710,yes but not that way
3711,representative trantis the daleks will not fail and neither will any of its allies if anything tries to stop us we will destroy it nothing will be allowed to stand in the way of our plan to conquer the universe
3712,yes and thats the problem it wont be easy
3713,yes but we cant land at the main landing area remember this is chens space vessel
3714,the drive force is very weak
3715,and the doctor
3716,he shouldnt be long
3717,doctor daxtar is in a position to help us
3718,doctor there are very few people allowed near this place its a restricted area look dont you understand that chen will probably have returned to earth by this time hed have realised that i was the man on the planet kembel i expect were wanted men by this time
3719,doctor i dont know anymore than you do
3720,the doctor saw it
3721,but why
3722,oh dont worry about its incredibility we got to do something to stop him
3723,of course we must get down to the security buildings at once the planets must all be alerted a combined task force must be sent off to kembel immediately
3724,what do you mean doctor what are you playing at
3725,i dont understand look this situation must be dealt with at once
3726,treachery ive known this man all my life hes no traitor
3727,dont be so ridiculous one of you mentioned it when you were telling me why you yourself mentioned it when you said that chen handed the stuff over
3728,what conspiracy youre making a stupid mistake
3729,traitor
3730,he deserved worse
3731,im going to get into the security building and send out the warning myself
3732,yes were probably being searched for now by other friends of chen i mean daxtar clearly knew about the disappearance of the taranium
3733,i could try to bluff my way out well its worth a try well you havent thought of a better idea
3734,of course there would we wouldnt have been able to believe anything he said
3735,yes hes dead the others must be killed as well they will be shot on sight but aim for the head
3736,hes right behind us i think hes probably dealing with that girl
3737,strange room
3738,there are mice inside funny sort of cage for mice
3739,i hope bret finds us
3740,yes if its moving fast enough
3741,ill give you five seconds to hand over that taranium
3742,the highest next to you
3743,doctor doctor
3744,whats going on where are we what on earths happened
3745,yes but whats happened all i know is she is about to shoot us and there was this fantastic noise
3746,she hasnt come round yet
3747,what
3748,you the traitors i must
3749,ill feel a lot better when we get out of this place
3750,where are we
3751,well how did we get here
3752,cellular what
3753,impossible
3754,yes but doctor what about that transmitter thing you know the one with the mice in it
3755,no send nothing further to mira inform me as soon as you regain any form of contact in the meantime send no further matter to that planet
3756,it mustnt be
3757,shut up bret vyon was my brother
3758,doc
3759,but how
3760,is that them
3761,but a start karlton a start
3762,yes but when we beat our way through weve got to stick together
3763,youre right doctor theyve come  dalek 1
3764,you will hand over the taranium core
3765,silence you will not speak
3766,patrol alert patrol alert annihilate them annihilate them
3767,our force already there is sufficient for the task contact them and order that the taranium is to be recovered failure will not be tolerated
3768,remain where you are
3769,do you have the taranium
3770,where are the others
3771,you will wait there until the patrol returns the others are to join you if you try to escape you
3772,can you work it doctor
3773,doors are not closing vacuumlock reading 224
3774,382 rising  dalek
3775,432 still rising  dalek
3776,that was close it was too close
3777,coding nine two red blue blue
3778,coding one zero zero all blue reading take off now
3779,will it work doctor
3780,i mean your plan
3781,there isnt time to suppose im sure the doctor can copy it well enough
3782,were changing course were moving away on a selected route
3783,sara the technology of my age may be hundreds of years behind yours and the doctors but there are still some things i can handle
3784,of course of course
3785,yes but theres still the problem of charging it the daleks will know immediately that it isnt the real taranium
3786,were still on our own course the daleks havent attempted to divert us yet
3787,hey
3788,this is excellent
3789,how do you propose to activate it
3790,whats wrong with that
3791,were changing course again
3792,that will take us right back to the daleks
3793,steven
3794,the fool hes tried his experiment with gforce and reliance power
3795,but it worked look doctor its just like the real taranium
3796,height and speed reducing
3797,i think the effects wearing off
3798,hes enclosed in a forcefield
3799,this time there will no error
3800,but it wont it cant work
3801,the taranium i would suggest that you give that to me young man
3802,possibly but you are still in no position to bargain
3803,you heard what the dalek supreme said
3804,very well in front of his ship
3805,traitor
3806,making sure of your escape eh doctor
3807,yes more or less
3808,you were enclosed in a field of gravity force and reliance power
3809,its a pity i blacked out i mean if i knew the ratio readings we could use the same force again to protect us from the daleks
3810,oh come off it it worked
3811,oh nonsense
3812,i know where ill be i dont know about you lot
3813,look if it havent been for me how would you have charged the taranium and carried out the handover i think we should experiment further
3814,but doctor
3815,all right doctor i promise that i wont experiment with it any further
3816,somethings gone wrong
3817,thats means that weve landed
3818,can you mend it
3819,well lets get on with it
3820,why not
3821,and just why if it isnt safe for us is it safe for you
3822,for heavens sake lets go and fix the scanner
3823,right then you shouldnt go out there either
3824,but suppose something happens to you
3825,and how are we supposed to know that something has happened to you
3826,and if not we come out and find you i seem to have been through all this before
3827,yes sir      constable 1
3828,oh i see weve landed on your own planet
3829,but thats whats written outside the tardis
3830,yes but you said the air out there was so bad that if we went out
3831,yes sir
3832,oh straight through  constable 1
3833,where
3834,ive heard of a housing shortage but i never knew it was so bad youd have to spend christmas in a police box
3835,you mean you didnt know

3847,i did and no help from either of you
3848,at least its working
3849,of course not after that man grabbed me i didnt have a chance
3850,oh id forgotten about the daleks
3851,yes but they wont have found out about the switch yet
3852,while we have the taranium their plan cannot work
3853,then what can we do
3854,i think weve stopped again
3855,go get them
3856,i mustve lost her where are we
3857,who is this girl if shes one of the harem why is she wearing that extraordinary clothing tell her to get them off send her to wardrobe

3865,i dont know but a strange man kept telling me to take my clothes off
3866,stop those two

3868,all the time they want something new new jokes there arent any
3869,custard pies have been done by chaplin so im not allowed to
3870,they they wont even let me do the wallpaper and paste routine you know why

3878,so it was yes
3879,same to you doctor sara
3880,what do you mean you dont know
3881,it must be the daleks
3882,we must get back to the planet kembel
3883,its still following us
3884,when are we going to land
3885,and i thought you knew what you were doing
3886,theyre getting closer doctor
3887,what are you doing
3888,yes well theres the position england wanting seventy eight runs in forty two and a half minutes to win
3889,was it on earth do you think
3890,yes well wherever it was theres still someone on our tail here look at this
3891,it doesnt look very pleasant does it
3892,what does that mean doctor have we shaken it off
3893,i still say it was madness to come out here we should have taken off again or tried to get back to kembel
3894,hey hey this is hot
3895,doctor who are we waiting for
3896,oh come on tell us otherwise youll say youre right whoever we meet
3897,doctor look
3898,well hello doctor keeping well
3899,thanks i wish i could say the same for you
3900,oh thank you most kind of you doctor yes it took a bit of time but i finally managed to bypass the dimensional controller
3901,yes it was rather uncomfortable but then we cant have everything can we as for being an amateur we shall see anyway it was better than 1066
3902,its all right weve met the monk once before ill explain later
3903,im afraid so doctor revenge is a strange thing isnt it
3904,hey wait a minute
3905,what does that mean
3906,yes perhaps but its better than just accepting everything
3907,well you havent been taking much interest have you doctor
3908,what does that do
3909,it hasnt worked
3910,youre a genius doctor
3911,if you ask me we havent heard the last of that monk
3912,yes but next time well be expecting him
3913,yes all right but first you tell us something how did you break that lock
3914,is there something special about it
3915,yes but what properties has it
3916,well you wont be able to carry out your repairs here doctor
3917,its some sort of celebration isnt it
3918,what do you think theyre celebrating
3919,what was that
3920,how long is it going to take you to mend the lock doctor
3921,oh yes and the other time machine is still registering
3922,well its quite impressive isnt it
3923,yes you could be right well theyve finished it you think there doesnt seem to be anyone around
3924,theres not much cover is there if the monks tardis lands this side of the pyramid we should see it easily however it disguises itself you know i think ill take a look from up there itll give me a better view
3925,doctor
3926,its over there sara about a quarter of a mile away
3927,well oughtnt we to take the initiative and go and meet the monk
3928,how long are you going to be
3929,tuthmos a slaughter i must fetch reinforcements  the surviving guards retreat to safety taking steven and sara with them elsewhere chen emerges from where hes hidden during the fighting dalek 1
3930,then youd better leave at once and waste no more of your valuable time
3931,remind me not to pick a fight with you come on    using his locator the monk has arrived at an area of open ground the original landing site of the doctors tardis now nowhere to be seen puzzled the monk looks down at the locator again as the needle swings around to point at the pyramid the monk moves off behind him the doctor looks worriedly at the spot where the tardis once stood then hurries after his quarry
3932,doctor youve been following me
3933,no come in very handy hasnt it you know doctor if your machine would blend in with its surroundings people wouldnt be able to find it and then we wouldnt have all this trouble
3934,exactly doctor like mine i could teach you a thing or two you know
3935,now doctor its a pity were having this feud you know oh by the way you didnt track me on your time curve indicator this time did you
3936,i jump crossed the track
3937,its simple really you know doctor i mean its up to you of course if youd like to come inside ill show you how it was done
3938,yes yes do you know i knew there was something i had to tell you ive come here to warn you about the daleks
3939,yes oh i played them along their own game of course for quite a time but they dont like you you know they dont like you at all
3940,what
3941,oh well you were talking at the time i didnt want to interrupt
3942,oh come now doctor surely you dont think i was going to help the daleks
3943,now doctor look lets talk this over like civilised timetravellers its the taranium core they want not you why dont you give it to them then we can be all on our way
3944,yes doctor we heard you
3945,now come doctor
3946,silence
3947,ah very wise
3948,you are in no position to make demands doctor a dalek escort will
3949,we could exterminate you now
3950,what are your terms doctor
3951,why cant you come here
3952,its not being done on your terms why dont you shut up  doctor
3953,but i am not their master
3954,you are released
3955,help help
3956,why not doctor what went wrong
3957,that means that the daleks have won theres nothing to stop them now
3958,whats that
3959,directional but with this we can get back to kembel
3960,but thats marvellous doctor
3961,no im sure it isnt doctor but this is hardly the time or the place to tell us about it i mean the daleks will be here soon
3962,like yours
3963,by the way what happened to him he was with us
3964,yes even after all that
3965,do you think hell come looking for revenge again
3966,what about our repairs will the unit work
3967,go on doctor
3968,but we do have a chance

3970,well come on i thought you said that its was finished
3971,oh come on doctor we havent got time for buts this is our only hope
3972,you can save your breath weve got to try it
3973,no his arrogance and greed have a further use for us alert the council to attend their final conference
3974,but the directional unit
3975,what happened
3976,then why did it burn out and not the tardis controls
3977,that means that the daleks can invade the universe and conquer it
3978,there must be something we can do doctor you must try to think of some way
3979,yes well lets get going
3980,its its more like kembel
3981,yeah sure

4114,doctor steven get a look at these fab pictures
4115,whats wrong with it
4116,yes well that could be the imagination of the artist
4117,theres only one way to find out
4118,go on you go ahead
4119,terrifying is this is earth its no longer inhabited by human beings
4120,bless you remind me never to take you out again when youve got a cold
4121,no me nose is running
4122,doctor
4123,it looks like some sort of city factory
4124,a spaceship
4125,we only know them as intelligences that inhabit that planet they might have a way of assuming human bodies of using them to pass to mingle amongst us
4126,thats right
4127,chills
4128,so have i in my own eyes and ears and machines tell fewer lies than men
4129,nero the trojan wars the daleks but all that happened in the first segment of time
4130,the fifty seventh
4131,using your measurement of time seven hundred years
4132,im afraid i dont know but we do have the earths full population human and animal
4133,while i am sure that you would be more interested in the technicalities of our control deck
4134,then ill leave you with our chief controller manyak he will explain everything
4135,dont touch him
4136,its nothing to worry about his temperatures a bit high thats all its just a fever it can only be a cold
4137,whats all the fuss about the mans caught dodos cold thats all
4138,whatll happen
4139,seize them all of you listen the success of all we stand for everything aboard this spaceship is suddenly endangered by the strange fever a fever brought by these strangers in our midst
4140,what do you think theyll do to us doctor
4141,its all my fault if id known it was going to be like this id never have come
4142,im not snivelling its me nose running again anyway im feeling better now but i dont suppose anyone cares
4143,look do you think this has happened before that weve carried an infection from one age to another or even one planet to another
4144,itll spread through the whole ship become an epidemic
4145,if its half as bad as my cold was it will
4146,no it isnt im crying this time
4147,yes father
4148,the success of its mission by expulsion from the ship miniaturisation or such lesser penalty as he shall deem fit     zentos
4149,i must go
4150,doctor i must im getting stifled in here i must go and do something even if its only to show them how stupid they are wasting time with trials and speeches after all the only important thing now is to let you organise finding a cure
4151,thats right let them be taken to the ejector chamber they must be thrown out
4152,do you think he may have caught the fever
4153,yes but it is the voted verdict there is nothing we can do about it
4154,very well if he has not decided wisely we will not live to know it
4155,is there anything we can do to help doctor
4156,warm but hes already sweating with the fever in the same way that my father is
4157,here i am doctor
4158,will these do
4159,how will i know where to find them
4160,okay
4161,i said okay
4162,i shall go with her

4164,ive wrapped steven warmly is there anything else i can do
4165,you mean keep them warm
4166,very well
4167,doctor
4168,well we need two
4169,hes conscious doctor but only just are you going to try it now
4170,do you really think itll work
4171,and what if you havent
4172,dont you have to squirt it into his arm
4173,where are you going
4174,isnt that a bit dodgy i mean he was supposed to be the guinea pig wasnt he
4175,is there anything further i can do
4176,zentos is waiting like a vulture just in case the treatment doesnt work
4177,doctor its along time now since you gave him that stuff and the fever only seems to be getting worse
4178,has something gone wrong
4179,you mean
4180,i told you it would be
4181,doctor the commanders fevers gone down so hes going to be all right
4182,the last moment has come
4183,yes in seven hundred years time
4184,goodbye
4185,doctor for the fact that i mistrusted you misjudged you im sorry
4186,goodbye doctor           dodo
4187,how
4188,doctor steven look
4189,no it was meant to be a human being now its a monoid wonder why
4190,but weve only been gone a few seconds
4191,yes well the guardians said it would take seven hundred years for this spaceship to reach the planet refusis two if that navigation charts anything to go by id say that theyre almost there
4192,then where are the guardians well at least the descendants of those we knew before surely they should be here guiding the ship
4193,yes but youd think one of them would be standing by to make sure nothing goes wrong
4194,yes but the guardians working as a kind of servant
4195,but the arm
4196,he can speak they couldnt before  monoid 2
4197,these strangers they  monoid 2
4198,whats it got to do with you
4199,but we also helped to find a cure didnt we i mean the doctor did  monoid 1
4200,but but thats incredible how in space could you do it
4201,of course take no notice of him doctor he was born a cynic
4202,no theyre too careful they never put them down
4203,hmm       monoid 2
4204,i dont care im right arent i
4205,its a sort of a castle monoid 2
4206,oh no    monoid 2
4207,no it came from the direction of that room  monoid 2
4208,then somehow we shall have to find out
4209,what do we do now
4210,what if they dont come what if they decide to find another planet
4211,youre not the only ones like that the guardians you know the humans who travel in the spaceship they have used to have your ideas too
4212,yes i know but there are some of them left who wouldnt mind rising up against the monoids and trying to do better  refusian
4213,now its up to steven and the others
4214,weve got to find a way of getting back to refusis      monoid 1
4215,its the doctor hello doctor this is steven
4216,but doctor how are you going to talk to the monoids and how are you going to send the launchers back to the ark  refusian
4217,i know and it was empty when we opened the door
4218,course we are
4219,so far but they havent found the bomb yet
4220,the way they were fighting there wont be many of them left
4221,whats that  refusian
4222,we understand
4223,well make them believe it
4224,why it must be  doctor
4225,doctor well where are you
4226,doctor youve vanished
4227,well it must be
4228,but were still in the tardis
4229,if you want to go then you go but im sure that the doctor would doctor
4230,we can see you everythings all right
4231,yes
4232,whats this extraordinary place
4233,it looks dead boring to me come on
4234,why
4235,theres nothing there
4236,its changed again there i am in paris
4237,but doctor
4238,whats the matter doctor i couldnt see anything on the screen
4239,whos the celestial toymaker
4240,what a spoilsport you are doctor they like my memory window
4241,its me the day my mother died
4242,what a shame i thought my little invention would amuse you
4243,whats the idea of it
4244,well cant we just go i hate this place
4245,yes hundreds come doctor
4246,blind mans buff
4247,patience doctor patience youve only just got here relax its so nice to see you again
4248,youre so innocent doctor the last time you were here i hoped youd stay long enough for a game but you had hardly time to turn around
4249,how absurd it amuses me to give amusement
4250,that is one of my rules certainly but if they win theyre perfectly free to go
4251,then you lose by default is that what you choose
4252,youre so insatiably curious thats why i ensured that the scanner would be blank i knew that would bring you out
4253,this
4254,the trilogic game a game for the mind doctor the developed mind difficult for the practiced mind dangerous for the mind that has become old lazy or weak
4255,well now we shall see perhaps it is merely lazy
4256,so you still think that you can pit your mind against mine
4257,good i hope that the time you have spent dabbling in your researches round the universe hasnt dulled you i need you
4258,yes im bored i love to play games but theres no one to play against the beings who call here have no minds and so they become my toys but you will become my perpetual opponent we shall play endless games together your brain against mine
4259,so you can doctor so you can but i think you will lose can you remember how to play
4260,that is right and you must rearrange them in the same order that they are now on point c
4261,when the two rows of numbers match the game is over
4262,dont be so impatient doctor    toymakergt there we mustnt forget them
4263,good heavens no they are on the competitive quest
4264,two clown friends of mine they are the home team they will play against your friends and win the quest
4265,this is where we control them one buzz for right turn two for left three to stop four to start
4266,but it must whats wrong with it i know lets pull instead
4267,lets hope not doctor i would hate you to end up in my dolls house i reserve that fate for your two friends
4268,no they will lose one game and then like the clowns theyll become my toys and we shall be able to amuse ourselves through all eternity
4269,you remember the agreement they must find your tardis before you finish your game if they dont then you will have to stay here and youll be in my power forever look theyve already reached their next test
4270,as you are certainly going to lose i feel i should be kinder to you youre no longer under the ban of silence there i have given you back your voice now youre sulking or have you forgotten how to speak
4271,i think theyll abide by the rules now doctor dont you agree theres no point in giving you back your power of speech if youre going to just sit there silent and solemn
4272,your friends are not doing very well
4273,perhaps its just another fake
4274,make the last move doctor
4275,you are indeed doctor well done the three of you have won your little games
4276,why didnt he make the others do it
4277,doctor
4278,oh youre safe youve won your game
4279,i cant wait to leave this place i dont want to play another game ever
4280,you know you must lose in the end  toymaker
4281,is it true doctor are we bound to fail
4282,you must tell us we ought to know
4283,unless what
4284,well do we have a chance to escape
4285,as long as we defeat you thats all i care you cant beat us now  toymaker
4286,not until ive laid hands on you
4287,i couldnt touch him
4288,doctor i offer you power power to corrupt to destroy think of the exhilaration of that power serve me and live
4289,we will see old man the game is not yet over we shall see
4290,it isnt what i have done but what you have not done you must finish the game you cannot leave here until you have
4291,make your last move doctor make your move
4292,and then you have won completely
4293,i think im going to take oh here he is
4294,so whats happened
4295,whats he done
4296,surely thats a good thing this is really a very sad place
4297,but we have won and it hasnt happened yet
4298,why doesnt he just let us go he cant want to be destroyed
4299,but if everything disappears why not him
4300,how
4301,and that price is the loss of his world
4302,so we cant leave
4303,of course and i look forward to that im bored with this one but im a bad loser doctor i always destroy the destroyer
4304,doctor let me go out and make that move for you
4305,at least you and dodo would get away

4504,life preys on other forms of life as you know doctor wild beasts live on other animals mankind must have food water and oxygen
4505,the energy of life which we accumulate we store in vats such as these then when the elders decide that some member of the community needs new force we can transfer that energy directly
4506,exactly we can give ourselves new power
4507,so you see doctor with this new stimulus intellectual workers find themselves able to accomplish more artists are able to create works of brilliance and beauty everything citizen  steven

4509,dodo was with us and she vanished into thin air

4543,i am sorry you take this attitude doctor it is most unscientific you are standing in the way of human progress
4544,they are hardly people doctor they are not like us
4545,do you not realise that all progress is based on exploitation
4546,we have achieved a very great deal merely by the sacrifice of a few savages

4553,you have your orders see that they are carried out
4554,i dont think so doctor
4555,go back doctor
4556,quickly fire now shoot

5067,oh so thats it youve been renewed have you
5068,yes
5069,doctor whats going to happen to us
5070,no you havent checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything
5071,yeah i heard but he might just have been copying you though mightnt he
5072,hello is there anyone there hello hello why dont they come  ah so youve come at last im from earth im the examiner
5073,if earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming we might possibly have been able to guide you down to the landing area
5074,now look here i run this colony im entitled to know why you have come to vulcan what is your brief
5075,why are you here
5076,someones leaked reports about these rebel groups thats it isnt it
5077,internal affairs are my business bragen please dont interfere
5078,the capsule it was found in a mercury swamp it must have been here for centuries
5079,for centuries before the earth colony arrived i felt it might be dangerous it might contain bacteria
5080,i shall look forward to your report bragen see that the examiner and his party get some proper clothes will you
5081,doctor when he was talking to you you were staring at the other man
5082,did he
5083,now you want to watch you dont take this examiner stuff a bit too far
5084,cause at least one bloke aint going to be fooled
5085,i dont know im on my way there now if i can push past bragens army of layabouts
5086,it dropped from the capsule
5087,well i have a theory im convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here or here
5088,examiner i shall have to make it your responsibility
5089,hmm its a bit disappointing
5090,i should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is
5091,leave it for tonight but what did we come here for
5092,but good heavens above man
5093,oh at least now there must be something in the inner compartment we shall be able to find out where it came from originally
5094,oh no no no the metal is quite alien
5095,come on
5096,what
5097,you could have opened this before
5098,why do you keep saying the doctor if you mean you
5099,live
5100,whats the matter
5101,did you see it
5102,it was a sort of disembodied hand a sort of claw it was horrible
5103,no he said he hadnt opened it lets get our facts straight
5104,well does that mean you think hes been inside
5105,but but theyre things i i mean theyre dead they must be
5106,do you mean these things just need power
5107,oh blimey you dont half make mountains dont you one dalek
5108,real doctor
5109,doctor look if theyre that dangerous what are you going to do about it
5110,what do you think youre doing in here
5111,who gave you permission
5112,accord every access
5113,i should have been asked first
5114,well the daleks
5115,yes
5116,yes
5117,i dont know what youre talking about
5118,i consider it my duty as a scientist to examine and investigate these objects now please all of you keep out of my laboratory keep your hands off my experiments
5119,i refuse to allow it
5120,youre exceeding your authority
5121,that might be difficult
5122,and of course you do have the right of any access
5123,lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen
5124,you know its little things like this that make it difficult to believe that youre the doctor the other one i mean the proper one oh nuts you know what i mean
5125,you my old china are an out and out phony
5126,no not china china china and plate mate friend
5127,dont listen to him doctor i know who you are
5128,yes so thats why you were messing about and talking nonsense
5129,ahem
5130,well they certainly believe in making us at home dont they
5131,you mean from the governor ah i dont know what do you think doctor
5132,oh well i vote we go back to the tardis ive had enough of this dump

5134,will you be quiet where do you both think you are this is a scientific laboratory kindly keep your politics out of it come on resno man get on with it we havent got all day weve got to get this working before the examiner stops us hes got some phobia about these these daleks
5135,doctor what was it
5136,it will have to
5137,where are you going
5138,im afraid thats not possible once his door is closed no one not even you examiner is allowed into his room
5139,what happens now
5140,you cant use the phrase watching us youll have us believing that the thing has intelligence next now get on with your work man
5141,what do you want
5142,i picked them up what is all this
5143,if those muscle boys of yours had any brains theyd stop things like this
5144,you mentioned to bragen that these machines of lestersons what do you call them
5145,yes yes yes daleks you say they could be a motive for destroying our communications
5146,governor ive just completed an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony bear with me
5147,whats the matter doctor are you all right
5148,youre scared what can it do
5149,it knew who you were it sounds ridiculous but it did
5150,stop you see well just think what this could do for our mining program our processing packaging dozens of labour jobs governor it may even supply the end to all this colonys problems
5151,it it spoke janley did you hear it it can actually talk
5152,yes and the effect of that on earth yes yes they could be very grateful
5153,all right lesterson permission granted
5154,to continue my work examiner
5155,never
5156,ah examiner just a moment tell me why are you so against this project
5157,no
5158,i am
5159,well we couldnt have helped him polly even if wed wanted to the governors already reached his verdict
5160,oh well the way i see it this lots too busy arguing amongst themselves to do much about anything anyway first things first the daleks are the important thing
5161,what did i do what did i do
5162,i hope you know what youre doing
5163,i thought we were after the daleks not this control unit youve nicked
5164,doctor what on earth are you up to
5165,look doctor i dont want to appear dim but hows this going to do the daleks in
5166,but how
5167,we could just go back to the tardis at least wed be safe to think there
5168,doctor look if you told us what you were up to perhaps we could help you
5169,yeah that could be the answer lets kidnap lesterson and hide him away for a bit well it would stop him bringing the daleks back to life wouldnt it i thought it was pretty bright
5170,what is it
5171,its all right polly
5172,yes but
5173,ah you see
5174,what do you want
5175,if you think
5176,youve done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on vulcan
5177,and you wont try to stop me
5178,well if you really want to call a truce
5179,yes yes very well you may stay
5180,ah yes yes very well then examiner shall we test its knowledge of physics
5181,you fool what do you think youre doing

5196,what
5197,the fool lesterson must have reactivated them
5198,we will conquer we will conquer we will conquer
5199,then we turn off the electricity disarm them and then everything is safe again
5200,stop these arguments both of you ive had enough ive every confidence in lesterson he has carte blanche for the daleks from now on
5201,i shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory bragen
5202,dont worry about the examiner i think i can keep him quiet
5203,examiner some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp it was the body of a middleaged man

5222,im very sorry but i dont know anything about it
5223,yes
5224,building no i wouldnt know how to begin

5236,i am the leader of the daleks
5237,i obey
5238,the governor will hardly listen to an impostor
5239,my guards are now going to produce the body of the real examiner from the mercury swamp
5240,the one you pretended to be
5241,youre the last man i expected to see here
5242,im speaking to you examiner
5243,if youd listened to me in the first place you wouldnt be locked up here now
5244,bragen ive known that all along
5245,bragen the leader
5246,hensells trouble is he thinks he can run this colony on his personality alone
5247,the governors popular he can count on the mine workers at the perimeter for support
5248,if youd done your job properly examiner you wouldnt be here now and id have been out too
5249,everything leads back friend bragen just give me a chance get my hands on him
5250,do you have to do that im afraid youll find these locks are foolproof
5251,what are you talking about
5252,static isnt workable
5253,im not going to listen to any more of this nonsense
5254,i hope not no
5255,just get out of my way ah examiner the daleks

5770,leave me piper no leave me ill not go
5771,oh doctor doctor it was horrible a great creature like a like a cyberman
5772,yes but doctor the cyberman was carrying one of the patients out
5773,im sure it was im sure it was
5774,what do you know about all this
5775,stop this cyberman nonsense there were cybermen every child knows that but they were all destroyed ages ago
5776,thats enough now lets have a little calm thinking for the past two weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base people drop in their tracks they develop this black pattern on their skin then some of the patients disappear right well they cant leave the base without wearing space suits and there are no space suits missing so where are they
5777,yeah well that suits me fine the sooner the better
5778,well why not they dont want us here
5779,evil dont be daft
5780,will you indeed
5781,but you cant move him hes very ill
5782,yes evans was working on an extensive research project its all in here
5783,its quite a small unit were not equipped to deal with a full scale epidemic you understand do you think you can manage
5784,what are you going to do doctor
5785,listen are you really a medical doctor
5786,well look what can we do to help

5793,well have to go and tell mister hobson i suppose
5794,doctor it wouldnt i mean it couldnt possibly have anything to do with lister could it
5795,well i mean you did say that you took your degree in glasgow in 1888 it does seem an awful long time from now 2070 or whatever it is
5796,oh no no no no no i was just wondering if there was anything that joseph lister didnt know in 1888 that might possibly help you now
5797,thats as might be but thats the third person to disappear in the past few hours its completely illogical single beds no way to get out
5798,what
5799,okay it must be you people weve got some straight talking to do you and i

5806,really
5807,doctor did you mean that
5808,youve found something
5809,here doctor youve completed your examination
5810,turned the base upside down poked into everything
5811,and youve found
5812,just as i thought
5813,so what i told you still stands
5814,its very hot doctor what about you
5815,well doctor as i was saying youve had your chance and youve come up with absolutely nothing now i want
5816,here charlie and you whats your name ben give us a hand to get him into the medical unit
5817,what the hell
5818,what are you doing
5819,what like the space plague
5820,thats all very well but how did it get in here
5821,my men have searched every square inch of the base theres no space to hide a cat let alone a cyberman anyhow how did they get in
5822,what is it
5823,yes what of it
5824,yes
5825,none whatever
5826,well
5827,well there were always people in here so they probably
5828,oh no no no no
5829,quick get out of here
5830,you devils you killed him an unarmed man  cyberman 1
5831,but you were all killed  cyberman 1
5832,why did they go to so such trouble
5833,why didnt they operate the controls themselves    cyberman 1
5834,quickly go and get their chest things
5835,the rest of you lower the armoured doors at all exits and you make up as much of that gubbins as youve got we may need it
5836,that makes it just over the rim
5837,about thirty degrees
5838,what do you mean
5839,its them theyre coming everybody inside quick
5840,not now weve discovered how they got in
5841,well someones got to go
5842,they get us every way these creatures
5843,all we have to do doctor is to hold on here
5844,what do you mean
5845,ben        cyberman
5846,over here
5847,no thats the scanner
5848,the rocket was deflected off course but why and how
5849,have the cybermen got a gravity weapon do you think
5850,youre not suggesting that
5851,i told you hed been on duty too long
5852,but he was in the medical room
5853,and the other men in there
5854,give me a hand off will you
5855,oh i see its so quiet
5856,weve barricaded the sick bay with half the tables and chairs in the base but it wont hold forever doctor
5857,doctor what do you make of this
5858,is there anything known to science the cybermen havent got
5859,looks like another of their spaceships
5860,doctor
5861,yes
5862,doctor are you all right
5863,the gravitron deflected it the force field
5864,whatll they cook up next i wonder
5865,down
5866,ah well i dont
5867,no but we should try
5868,it can only go to here any further down and the field may affect the base
5869,well i suppose youre right
5870,hes ready
5871,thats as far as itll go
5872,right
5873,yes its off
5874,it wont go
5875,ah stupid of me of course it wont
5876,well the angular cut out its obvious isnt it you see theres got to be a safety cut out on the angle of the probe otherwise it might affect the whole base there thats done it no no no stand back benoit can do it now
5877,switch on
5878,well thats taken care of the cybermen now then everybody weve got to get this gravitron in operation again as fast as we can
5879,could that be them
5880,yes and look what happened last time

6440,but surely theres more places than london
6441,do you think this is some sort of a trap doctor
6442,not the chameleons again
6443,oh if only the laird could see that why do i get all the difficult tasks doctor
6444,none of the lasses here can remember anybody called ken or kenneth

6462,of course i did the mans a rogue
6463,except what
6464,now thats ridiculous
6465,then its a forgery
6466,ive got an idea
6467,all the stuff in here is genuine
6468,but brand new
6469,well that is impossible unless waterfield could have invented a time machine like the tardis doctor and hes bringing all this stuff back from victorian times
6470,no wait wait what am i to do with the body i cant i cant go on with this
6471,what about the wire
6472,oh what are you doing here

6475,my name isnt kenneth its keith now look i dont understand this
6476,well hes a man mister waterfield employs
6477,ken kennedy
6478,this old police box was for a collector of curios
6479,but why is it so important to you
6480,at the back
6481,we might be able to get over the yard gates you see this door has an electric lock on it
6482,doctor
6483,should we have let him go
6484,but the tardis
6485,looks as if waterfields cleared out
6486,well obviously he didnt know he was going to have a fight with kennedy och come on doctor lets find the tardis and go
6487,what its your picture
6488,fourteen fifteen
6489,hey doctor theres a keyhole
6490,hey the other half of your picture
6491,hello sir are you feeling better oh you did have a party last night didnt you sir the master sent this in for you
6492,oh no sir mister maxtible mister waterfield came back from abroad last night sir with you and the young gentleman dont you remember
6493,id best not wake him
6494,mollie dawson sir
6495,am i to pour some more
6496,the date
6497,mollie that will do the answers you require sir might come better from me my name is theodore maxtible and i am the owner of this house pray dont get up i have the greatest sympathy for your condition since i was the cause of it   targetblank marius goring
6498,there were circumstances
6499,please please doctor first things first you asked what date it was and where you were
6500,youre in my house some miles from canterbury the date is june the 2nd eighteen hundred and sixty six
6501,we had nothing to do with the death of that man
6502,you will believe doctor we are all of us the victims of a higher power a power more evil and more terrible than the human brain can imagine
6503,theyve taken my daughter victoria
6504,doctor do whatever it is they ask i beg of you my daughters life is in your hands
6505,here we are doctor this is hallowed ground here we shall not be disturbed by the servants
6506,patience my dear sir a little longer
6507,neither whitefield nor i were responsible for his death a cigar
6508,inhuman monsters
6509,let me explain
6510,i have always been fascinated by the concept of travelling through time waterfield here is an expert in certain technical matters and i have the money to indulge my whims everything you see about you here was constructed by us two
6511,yes now this is my theory a mirror reflects an image does it not
6512,so you may be standing there and yet appear to be standing fifty feet away well following the new investigations twelve years ago by j clark maxwell into electromagnetism and the experiments by faraday into static electricity
6513,like repels like in electricity doctor and so next waterfield and i attempted to repel the image in the mirrors wherever we directed
6514,that was our last experiment negative and positive electricity had failed so we tried static if only we could have known the powers we were going to unleash
6515,oh my dear fellow my dear dear fellow but we shall win through now that the doctor is here
6516,we had opened the way for them with our experiments they forced me into the horror of time travel doctor they ordered me to steal a box belonging to you and thus lure you into a trap and transport you here together with your colleague mister mccrimmon
6517,what could i do they said my daughter would die
6518,doctor now do you understand
6519,move back our plan has worked we shall triumph you will obey you will obey
6520,we have your time ship we will destroy it unless you help us with an experiment
6521,you will help the daleks test another human being
6522,do not question
6523,no harm will come to you if you agree where is your companion
6524,he is in the house i have done everything you asked me to
6525,he is the human being who is to be tested
6526,silence you will reveal nothing to your companion obey the daleks you are in our power
6527,i believe i do they i mean the daleks tell me they have always been defeated by human beings
6528,possibly because of some factor possessed by human beings
6529,that is absent in daleks
6530,oh my dear fellow i am merely surmising i know nothing definite but besides what could we have done even if i had known for certain the fact was nay is they hold your daughter victoria
6531,here we are sir ive been as quick as i could shall i pour for you poor young gentleman they shouldnt have given you so much to drink
6532,but they ordered you not to tell your friend mccrimmon anything
6533,but suppose he refuses to do what they want
6534,it was maxtibles invention
6535,but your friend is vital to the plan of these daleks absolutely essential
6536,oh why wont you understand the threats they make are not idle ones kennedy was murdered without your friend our only hope is gone unless unless you know something you seem to be well acquainted with the creatures
6537,mollie mollie mister mccrimmon has been kidnapped it means the end of us unless we can find him quickly
6538,i beg your pardon
6539,oh i see youre in good hands now i wont detain you any further good day doctor
6540,hes mad stark staring mad
6541,och its all right
6542,one minute he says this the next minute he says that can you make it out doctor im knocked on the head and im brought in here then that man terrall enters and denies having ordered the other man to do it well then he changes and he starts asking about victoria waterfield and in the next breath he tells me shes in paris
6543,what has
6544,you warned him told him about the daleks
6545,but you were expressly told
6546,are you sure
6547,now if he gets through here you will deal with him go now
6548,but we have your time machine
6549,so you will obey us
6550,yes that is what they want
6551,yes the conquest of humanity has eluded us the daleks must know why
6552,his travelling with you makes him unique
6553,request denied
6554,you have travelled too much through time you are more than human
6555,they have been brought from the dalek planet
6556,their life force is dormant before it is activated we want
6557,you will obey us
6558,do not antagonise them doctor they will destroy your time machine
6559,the human being with you must not be aware of the trial
6560,make him begin the test
6561,do you know my uncle was killed at inkerman sir so you see i do know what its like with soldiers oh oh im sorry sir
6562,i didnt mean to
6563,well cook said to me that if i did some dusting it would be all right
6564,you wont tell the master will you
6565,thank you sir sorry
6566,oh forget about all that
6567,look whereve you been
6568,aye what for the tardis
6569,oh am i is that bad then does that mean i wont be cooperative i wont do everything im told
6570,i overheard you and waterfield
6571,well whatever it is i dont like what youre doing
6572,no doctor youre forgetting the tardis was stolen and a man was murdered now how am i supposed to tell when i see you as friendly as you like with the murderer
6573,all right then but he stole the tardis and that still makes him a thief
6574,the daleks you keep telling me about the daleks and i havent even seen one youre always on about them but where are they
6575,no youll not get round me this time doctor youre up to something with waterfield and maxtible now what is it some scientific invention ah heres your friend
6576,thats not all youll hear
6577,well arent you
6578,then why dont you try and get her back ay what are you doing
6579,aye and thats all you can think about isnt it the tardis well you can all stand around doing nothing im sick to death of it
6580,to be by myself for a bit do you mind
6581,well are you sure you didnt go a little too far doctor
6582,oh very well doctor if youre sure
6583,im off to hunt a few ghosties mollie
6584,and then transformed into thought patterns on silver wire a wonderful creation  dalek1
6585,we shall watch your every move
6586,the daleks are afraid of nothing and noone
6587,human weakness
6588,we do not trust you what thoughts are you using now
6589,what is the significance of this thought pattern
6590,introductions in a moment if you please first id like to make us a little bit more secure kemel if we lash this bedstead across the door it might just hold rope thats it we could do with a chest against it im thinking another one on top ay well now they cant get in and we cant get out so where does that put us oh jamie mccrimmon i er i came to give you this
6591,no i wont i very rarely touch it
6592,no thank you
6593,no you seem determined to involve me
6594,this is a large house i prefer my own company
6595,yes possibly no doubt you will enjoy your libation in one of the other rooms
6596,shouldnt you be helping waterfield and maxtible with their experiment
6597,about what pray
6598,do i know what
6599,i dine alone
6600,you seem to be a devotee of edgar allan poe
6601,nor to meddle in affairs which are none of your business
6602,doctor excuse me youre wanted
6603,doctor no doubt youre a keen student of human nature but some things are better left alone
6604,i will bring victoria to you
6605,the human factor
6606,in there
6607,so the end is in sight
6608,what happens when the capsule comes into contact with the brain of the dalek and starts to influence it
6609,or turn them into superbeings
6610,you have completed the experiment
6611,stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished
6612,doctor
6613,you cant you mustnt do it
6614,you must stop the experiment
6615,i know
6616,but before its too late
6617,yes but what are we doing what are we really doing turning these creatures into superbeings
6618,adding all that is best and finest in human nature to all that is brilliant and superior in them theyll be unbeatable
6619,but youre making over the whole world to them dont you realise that our world our future they will enslave us for all time
6620,and sacrifice a whole world a history past present and future destroy an entire race
6621,please i implore you stop it
6622,arthur are you all right whats happened to him
6623,what do you mean
6624,yes

6629,yes i think so wait theres something at the back of my mind victoria waterfield i feel ive harmed her in some way
6630,you youre positive
6631,yes if thats what you want ill find ruth by the stables
6632,well thats fine for ruth maxtible but you lied about victoria
6633,turn around pick up the human female obey obey hurry hurry move into the cabinet obey move
6634,och dont touch me
6635,anyone would think this was a little game
6636,of course it isnt doctor people have died the daleks are all over the place fit to murder the lot of us and all you can say is youve had a good nights work
6637,no doctor look im telling you this you and me were finished youre just too callous for me anything goes by the board anything at all
6638,och words what do i care about words you dont give that much for a living soul except yourself
6639,i dont know did you look doctor just whose side are you on
6640,friends
6641,well how do you know they havent succeeded
6642,how do you know you can trust them doctor

6644,a rather amusing little game dont you think jamie
6645,trains trains trains trains
6646,dizzy dizzy dizzy doctor
6647,im glad you are so easily amused
6648,well i congratulate you doctor they are almost human
6649,and i will now leave you to your little games
6650,well how old are they now doctor mentally

6652,friend hello friend
6653,hello

6655,alpha
6656,beta
6657,omega
6658,omega
6659,we must go now we are called
6660,all daleks are ordered to return to skaro
6661,but if the daleks are returning to skaro wheres victoria
6662,dalek doctor
6663,doctor daleks going to destroy house cant turn it off
6664,well if you cant turn it off surely
6665,well toss it out the window then
6666,cupboard in the alcove the time machine
6667,right now wheres victoria
6668,twenty eight doctor hey doctor kemel must have dropped this
6669,and that is the dalek city
6670,oh please dont bother i feel much better
6671,yes
6672,you mean just walk into the city
6673,how long have you known thats there
6674,that was a human voice i tell you
6675,victoria
6676,that was victorias voice
6677,one of your experiments doctor for a moment i thought we were done for
6678,omega
6679,i have come to lead you
6680,careful
6681,follow me
6682,a prisoner
6683,what are you doing
6684,you know perfectly well there are other people in the city they wanted to draw them on trap them oh if only i could have thought quickly oh kemel
6685,so you are the doctor
6686,the experiment is over
6687,speak louder
6688,explain
6689,no
6690,silence the human factor showed us what the dalek factor was
6691,the human factor is useless
6692,they will be impregnated with the dalek factor your discovery but your work is not over
6693,what is the dalek factor
6694,you mean to say hes worked against us all just for that
6695,look its daft though metal into golds an old wives tale
6696,ah they didnt succeed though
6697,oh well i dont care whether its possible or not
6698,oh and what is the point then
6699,they promised me
6700,youll do no such thing
6701,you will not harm this human being or you will be exterminated
6702,its no good papa he doesnt listen any more what are you thinking
6703,perhaps they think youre like him
6704,they intend to persuade you then
6705,i see
6706,no
6707,your own
6708,specific gravity
6709,yes ha ha ha yes yes
6710,yes the dalek factor
6711,we know you will obey
6712,doctor
6713,we will work together on the dalek factor follow me
6714,this machine will transform the thought patterns in this capsule into a steam the steam will be sprayed into the atmosphere of the earth
6715,do so
6716,yes
6717,what
6718,what are you doing
6719,i dont know well i dont understand i mean how do we know we can trust him
6720,we have searched without success
6721,you will deal with the human prisoners
6722,well arent you coming
6723,ah well why didnt it affect you then
6724,you will obey without question
6725,do not question
6726,why obey without question
6727,keep back you cannot enter
6728,the emperor must explain
6729,but not without question
6730,doctor
6731,hurry man
6732,why
6733,hurry
6734,we must go doctor
6735,no time for help
6736,yes good life to save please you must victoria
6737,no time for me
6738,why why why
6739,friends
6740,the daleks must not cannot be destroyed the race will survive the daleks will live and rule forever
6741,a dalek nearly caught us but i tossed it over the edge but poor kemel
6742,where is my father is he dead
6743,we cant leave her alone doctor
6744,i dont know i cant believe it its so big where are we
6745,what are all these knobs
6746,well yes you see we travel around in here through time and space
6747,how can you i mean if what you say is true then you must be er well how old
6748,aye right this way victoria try to give us a smooth take off doctor we dont want to frighten her
6749,hold it right there friend
6750,yes all right hopper
6751,youd better listen to him
6752,he was killed the moment you made your appearance
6753,i think this fellow must be the member of a rival expedition
6754,look at him archaeologist written all over him
6755,tell them doctor go on tell them
6756,yeah you think it over come on lets go well wait for you back at the ship
6757,oh yes do as he says
6758,what name
6759,no one would come here for any other reason
6760,oh must we i dont like the look of those things at all
6761,perhaps we dont want your help
6762,of course no one questions your leadership
6763,doctor
6764,no dont touch him
6765,let me doctor
6766,aye well ive not had much exercise lately
6767,surely it was for just such a contingency as this that you insisted we bring him with us
6768,come on
6769,but why wasnt toberman killed why werent you killed
6770,come on then were wasting time of course after you professor
6771,thank you dont you think its a bit
6772,hey ill have you know that oh aye
6773,did you ever seen the like of it doctor
6774,no apart from the entrance
6775,two other doors
6776,doctor you seem to be very familiar with this place
6777,yes yes i can see that but how did you know in the first place
6778,oh really doctor and may we know what that is
6779,now to concentrate on this whatever it is this hatch must lead somewhere and there must be some opening mechanism what was that about symbolic logic any ideas
6780,well the basis of this code is binary to digital conversion with a intervening step involving a sort of whitehead logic  well when this burrier series is complete there is no more to be done
6781,really doctor for an archaeologist you seem to be curiously lacking in curiosity
6782,what do you mean by that
6783,everything here is designed to keep their secrets whatever they are insoluble
6784,but take this
6785,but take this mathematical sequence for example im really no nearer to its solution ive tried every possible combination youd hardly call that easy
6786,why thank you
6787,look sum between limits of one and nine one integral into power series yes yes then you differentiate
6788,whats happening
6789,i wont be long
6790,there must be some way to release it doctor
6791,okay press the buttons
6792,i didnt like that very much doctor
6793,okay go ahead
6794,i already have whats the matter doctor
6795,which one what
6796,weve got to get out this building its deadly theyll kill all of us if we dont get back to rocket
6797,keep back keep back youll bring it out again
6798,but you saw the cyberman doctor
6799,well
6800,of course must you state the obvious
6801,are you sure doctor
6802,yes doctor
6803,oh im not sure doctor
6804,youre crazy man youll bring that that thing out again
6805,anytime doctor
6806,cant you stop this hell kill us all
6807,careful doctor
6808,its a trap
6809,its a fossil
6810,whats a cybermat
6811,not impossible ones im not its the fuel pumps some character has balled up the lot
6812,i dont care what any of you say i utterly refuse i will not spend the night on this planet
6813,well its not exactly peaches back on the ship
6814,yeah until i find who broke into that rocket
6815,who broke into the rocket until then im going to keep a round the clock guard on it
6816,im going to get off this place with my skin still fitting tight all over all right
6817,we have no alternative it seems
6818,of course you can leave here anytime you please doctor
6819,but youre not going to are you doctor
6820,ill stay with you
6821,oh ill stay
6822,yes well let the doctor past
6823,very strong
6824,thats it ive got it finally a boolean function of symbolic logic
6825,everything yields to logic our basic assumption doctor
6826,six cap b four if and only if c is cap function of two a
6827,ive done it ive done it
6828,you heard me professor the
6829,all right
6830,the hatch
6831,he stays with me
6832,of course i am being selfish his strength will be useful to you down there he must go down go down toberman
6833,you obviously knew what to expect
6834,i dont know lets try this way
6835,tombs i dont see any tombs
6836,like a gigantic honeycomb like bees waiting the signal to arise from their winter sleep
6837,its closed what have they done that for what are they playing at up there
6838,of course im sure you know how heavy that thing is its down now we must do something i give us a couple of hours in here at the most
6839,of course youre forgetting your logic if it closes it can be opened from here
6840,right are we ready i shall now operate the sequence
6841,theyre cybermen
6842,keep away

7232,doctor are you trying to tell me that that old man was responsible for all this the yeti the cave
7233,please doctor our abbot will be most grieved that he did not thank you personally will you not wait
7234,ill see them safely up the mountain
7235,those horrible things
7236,oh no
7237,do you think hell ever find his abominable snowman doctor
7238,oh its all right for you in your home made yeti kit
7239,a nip a nip just look at my knees theyre bright blue
7240,could you not land us somewhere warmer next time
7241,failing again  is decreasing not far from total disintegration      jamie
7242,oh no not again tibet was bad enough but i think youve put us down just further up the mountain
7243,up you go
7244,what is it
7245,but doctor look
7246,yes and see how smooth it is and curved
7247,oh doctor its just like my home
7248,we could be  announcer
7249,it seems safe enough
7250,thank you excuse me miss im jamie mccrimmon do you think you could tell us where we are
7251,hey this says were on evacuation flight seven
7252,hey and this tag it says im a scavenger and yours does too here were not beggars
7253,what is it doctor
7254,oh no now look it might be dangerous now lets leave it
7255,doctor
7256,now is  still out of phase seven two point four
7257,now balance those gauges miss henry 17 degrees out of norm
7258,one three sevennine
7259,who the blazes are you get these scavengers out of here quick
7260,well how can you possibly know that i havent even i havent even processed them through the computer yet
7261,if hes right its already too late to escape
7262,theres insufficient power for that
7263,how did you it was all a bluff wasnt it that two minutes thirty eight seconds to danger
7264,rubbish
7265,immediate emergency in two minutes thirty seven seconds the reactor will explode
7266,why even penley couldnt have done better where on earth did you spring from it doesnt matter now look
7267,yes youre right contact the medicontrol centre the moment theres a further downward fluctuation well talk at the same time come with me
7268,but youve no valid proof of your qualifications
7269,all about it all about what where have you been all these years
7270,oh i see in tibet well if youll take a simple test ill soon know if youre up to our scientific standards
7271,oh no not africa
7272,i present you a problem all the major continents are threatened with destruction under the glaciers of the second ice age
7273,how would you halt the ice surge and turn the climate back to normal forty five seconds starting from now
7274,no such change has occurred
7275,come on doctor
7276,i asked for an answer not a question twelve seconds left
7277,oh but i still dont understand
7278,oh where does the gas go to
7279,on the land that was once used to grow the food we needed we built up to date living units to house the everincreasing population
7280,well there were exceptions of course i mean this house was classified as being of historic interest so the amount of growing plants on the planet was reduced to an absolute minimum
7281,ionisation is a method of intensifying the suns heat onto the earth but into particular areas
7282,only by maintaining a perfect balance can we prevent widespread flooding
7283,of course they can
7284,when the imprint data is complete they will give us the solution
7285,soon doctor soon
7286,well were barely holding the glacier in check now there you see a world map of the situation at the moment and there you see whats going on in our sector but if we fail then not only will europe be swallowed up but the balance of power will be ruined and the whole world programme will go under
7287,my senior scientist penley is missing i think you have the capabilities to join us here in this great mission will you help us
7288,jolly good jolly good miss garrett will give you some background information youve worked with computers i presume
7289,well miss garrett is our computer specialist shell help you
7290,here we are completely computerised
7291,it looks like a viking warrior look at the helmet
7292,an addition to our staff arden whats odd doctor
7293,well whats supposed to happen doctor
7294,its working quite quickly
7295,what is it
7296,it cant be
7297,more information is necessary for a full evaluation high iq but undisciplined for our needs present evaluation to be used on research projects but could be obstructive in certain situations
7298,doctor would you mind
7299,yes this is a private meeting
7300,and we have not yet completed our business
7301,has something happened to the warrior
7302,we have more serious matters on hand
7303,now let him tell us clent well
7304,its a prehistoric drinking cup
7305,but thats impossible you must be mistaken
7306,well it must mean the civilisation he came from must be more advanced than we thought
7307,how do you mean
7308,but if this is true
7309,in what way how can one preserved body however old effect us
7310,well if what you say is true by spaceship
7311,quite and er if we use the ioniser at full power
7312,it merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more vital
7313,doctor
7314,alive and i found it
7315,thats impossible to be preserved yes but to come alive impossible
7316,what not human
7317,well i used a low voltage especially
7318,yes but it was quite safe
7319,oh look i dont know what youre all talking about but all i know is victorias in danger and what are we doing to save her
7320,well thatll be just too bad obviously i cant release men for an extensive search outside the base
7321,oh not the computer
7322,och hows a machine to know
7323,what about victoria though
7324,spacecraft hey do you reckon thats where the warriors gone back to
7325,well what about me then i could go with him
7326,well the computer said one investigator only
7327,as the doctor has agreed to help us with the ioniser yes very well the boy can go
7328,good well
7329,i choose not to
7330,youre not here to question me
7331,this is the most important job ive ever had now every other project ive handled with ease nothing has failed i was chosen because i never fail when i handpicked the team i made one vital mistake
7332,best man in europe for ionisation studies as it turned out hopelessly temperamental
7333,creative poppycock when he walked out of here he proclaimed himself to be criminally criminally irresponsible
7334,he was always protesting this is a team a team with a mission if we fail others cannot succeed
7335,i lead the team i depend on the experts i picked my judgement was sound others wont see it that way
7336,no i do not need penley but i do need an equivalent brain but it would be months before anyone else could pick up the knowledge that penley acquired here just isnt time thats the pertinent issue
7337,i er i was going to give him this
7338,ive come very close to it at times ive never seen him look so peaceful
7339,yes a monstrous looking creature i didnt like the look of him at all
7340,yes she seemed scared stiff
7341,well i came here to get some drugs for a man who is sick i couldnt run the risk of getting caught
7342,shes alive my friend will die if i dont get back
7343,are you going after them i can take you part of the way
7344,well ive got what i want im off
7345,you know about me then my escapades in computerland
7346,needing isnt getting im free of their problems for good
7347,my world is up here private and no admittance well im going to go then
7348,you know its nice to meet one that they havent got at yet
7349,goodbye
7350,he knocked me out with a power pack
7351,well now hell head for the glacier lets get way after him
7352,but we cant just stand around waiting
7353,see it is working zondal is coming to life zondal zondal zondal
7354,after whats happened here he must be blind
7355,aye lets away
7356,dont be to too hard on yourself scientists must question you know i mean if id been in your shoes i think id have done the same id have id have brought it back so anyway good luck
7357,well doctor lets see you go into action ill just get miss garrett to take you over the setup here
7358,miss garrett i like things done properly where is she
7359,yes of course but this is a formal establishment and our regulations
7360,i see like penley regulations seemed to bother him too probably caused his eventual breakdown in fact
7361,did i well one thing lead to another naturally he was under a great deal of pressure just too much for him thats all
7362,activate direction sensors steady sonic stalls ready set to wide impact take aim continuous fire
7363,genius at work i see good morning doctor
7364,well this is all very impressive doctor but dont you think itd be simpler to use a computer
7365,the base computer
7366,yes yes anything what is it
7367,doctor would you mind explaining just what it is that you are
7368,would these figures help
7369,data readings from the other bases
7370,of course
7371,yes leader clent i have been looking up scientist penleys notes these could these help
7372,is that it
7373,thats fantastic
7374,its very possible
7375,we shall see
7376,the computer will confirm that im sure
7377,well everythings checked
7378,just normal practice doctor
7379,we have to be quite sure itll only take a matter of seconds copy all this down miss garrett and then we can feed it through the computer and do a simulator run ill just go and set it up
7380,we may not have time for that
7381,i thought it might be useful
7382,oh clent might call him that but hes still the most brilliant scientist we have
7383,what is  arden
7384,is there any sign of a spacecraft  arden
7385,weve just finished programming the computer we shall have the result very quickly
7386,yes thats true but you know what arden is with his scientific curiosity
7387,yes ill do it if you dont mind leader clent calling scientist arden arden do you receive me
7388,it looks as if hes arden for heavens sake man come in    doctor
7389,what about this project with arden missing
7390,i hope so im not sure that i trust your judgement yet doctor
7391,it works
7392,the equation works
7393,good good jolly good success is at last possible inform all ioniser bases miss garrett thank you doctor its a triumph
7394,i appreciate your feelings i too have lost a colleague
7395,we cannot be sentimental in this situation doctor our mission continues we must all play our part
7396,now we can go ahead it only needs programming
7397,im sorry but some lives are bound to be lost
7398,she must be stopped     victoria
7399,well reactor turbine ion jet antigravity think girl
7400,look it isnt easy now i have to have time to think
7401,you are wrong zondal she must answer some questions first why are they so interested in our engines why are they afraid
7402,yes
7403,well you choose the category of the article that you want by indicating it on one of these little chaps here jolly good and now you dial the precise chemical formula that you want there
7404,oh whats that
7405,indeed
7406,that will
7407,with the help of ammonium sulphide
7408,chiefly nitrogen with virtually no oxygen or hydrogen
7409,what you mean you intend to use it as a kind of toxic gas
7410,now dont be ridiculous weve lost arden already
7411,i refuse to allow you to go
7412,no one can be spared least of all leader clent
7413,but if anything goes wrong with the countdown
7414,no
7415,ive come to regard you as penleys replacement and all right all right but its strictly under protest
7416,how will you get the information back to us
7417,no our video links are the only communicators available pure sound is no longer in use
7418,is that all youre taking
7419,but you must be in a position to defend yourself theyll try to kill you out of hand
7420,but how can you rely on that theyve already proved themselves to be utterly ruthless
7421,you mean youre going to let them take you prisoner
7422,can you hear me help oh im trapped
7423,has anyone passed this way
7424,a rather ragged fellow like me
7425,then im too late theres nothing i can do
7426,well youve helped me once already why didnt you give me away or stop me at the base
7427,this boy hes your friend
7428,its good to see you again doctor
7429,how long
7430,i will walk again though
7431,what can we do for him
7432,thats the glacier its moving forward even faster
7433,all right ill help you take him back
7434,you dont expect me to face clent alone that mouth piece of the computer hes got a printed circuit where his heart should be
7435,well thats not the point anyway what are you going to do
7436,what can you do alone
7437,doctor if you go to the warriors youll be their prisoner
7438,im pinning all my hopes on the doctor he must succeed  doctor
7439,one two three four
7440,he cannot afford to lie allow him to enter
7441,you claim to be able to help us
7442,you are our prisoner it is we who set conditions
7443,not on your terms bring in the girl now we will have two hostages
7444,inside our spaceship we are safe and with you here your base will dare not use their secret weapon against us
7445,you know how it works
7446,youre hurting me
7447,oh doctor oh dear but theyve got you too
7448,what about jamie
7449,if what you say is true why have you not freed us before
7450,what are they
7451,keep very still
7452,well
7453,you would use the ioniser
7454,but you could not hope to escape to tell the tale
7455,you have some kind of communicator
7456,now wed better get away quick he wont be any friendlier when he wakes up
7457,true but your friends do not know that
7458,we can get what we want without your help
7459,we have had enough of your questions now you will give me answers
7460,that is only a toy the base what is its power source
7461,answer
7462,answer the commanders questions
7463,doctor dont tell them
7464,you shouldnt have
7465,prepare to charge to frequency three five  warrior
7466,wait until varga returns triumphant then you will have cause to cry
7467,what is it
7468,ammonium sulphide its only a stink bomb
7469,what use is that
7470,theres theres water seeping into the ship just there
7471,what we need is someone like penley or that doctor somebody who can think not with a machine and what goods your precious computer done anyway nothing nothing but trouble and its time somebody put a stop to it
7472,we must escape
7473,did you hear that making them shut down the reactor
7474,what
7475,what is it youre trying to do
7476,the objects vibrate in sympathy well i know my father told me once
7477,damage oh like a singer breaking glass
7478,what will that do
7479,what good is that to us
7480,if it works what happens
7481,oh now look doctor
7482,you mean itll knock them out and leave the scientists a bit dizzy well is that it
7483,you are trying to trick me again for that you will die
7484,oh
7485,you will die for this
7486,what
7487,doctor jamies in there hes alive
7488,what happened did you do that
7489,we have no time everything depends on being ready to break free from the ice as soon as they evaporate it
7490,oh the ioniser they made me disconnect it
7491,yes of course
7492,because of the risk man you know what would happen
7493,the computer considers everything
7494,we trust the computer it is our strength and our guide
7495,well why not
7496,aye but if it does nothing thats just as bad
7497,yes i know that but the other bases havent got a glacier right on top of them and apart from that what about these ice warriors if they live they threaten our entire civilisation
7498,i darent
7499,its as though its gone mad
7500,only a minor explosion were safe
7501,are you going to include well wheres the doctor    ltback to the episode listing
7502,yes doctor we must know
7503,move
7504,but giles what can i do  kent
7505,hey theres a funny looking boat
7506,eh
7507,oh yes yeah im too old for fairy tales
7508,oh well soon get a closer look its coming nearer
7509,why whats the matter
7510,but doctor
7511,but why do they want to harm us
7512,look doctor cant we go back to the tardis
7513,perhaps weve landed in a world of mad men
7514,i cant i cant
7515,hurry
7516,but what is this thing doctor
7517,huh
7518,he says its a bird
7519,its nothing were lucky to be still alive
7520,im all right
7521,through the arch theres a medical kit in the bathroom through there
7522,right
7523,its nothing its just a scratch
7524,no why should i
7525,oh youre a doctor
7526,doctor of law philosophy
7527,oh i see youre determined to be mysterious
7528,doctor of science
7529,a doctor of divinity then
7530,astrid ferrier
7531,hello
7532,kill you they hate you
7533,there wouldnt be time
7534,they are
7535,far from it to me youre the most wonderful and marvellous man thats ever dropped out of the skies will you do something for me
7536,itll probably cost you your life oh but it would be worth it
7537,let me take you to the man i work for giles kent hell explain everything you want to know
7538,can we not just listen doctor theres no harm in that
7539,a dictator like napoleon
7540,salamander
7541,the back door hurry
7542,itll blow up
7543,im sorry do sit down
7544,but surely you know how alike you are after all salamander is a world figure
7545,i see where shall i start
7546,theres nothing there to say hes a bad man
7547,until salamander invented his sun store but surely youve heard you must know
7548,oh like the ioniser doctor
7549,for his own ends step by step hes taking control of this planet
7550,some yes i was once a high official in the world zone authority deputy security leader for north africa and europe but salamander discredited and ruined me because he realised i was beginning to get suspicious
7551,all of them were replaced by men known to be in salamanders power
7552,by me doctor
7553,because im discredited dont you see because salamander is so popular and also because the man that took my place a man named donald bruce has since risen to become overall security chief
7554,well he has but hes afraid you see the testimony of a dead man still holds legal weight
7555,well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves
7556,impersonate salamander
7557,exactly like him
7558,well its nearly the same pitch only the accent
7559,thats incredible doctor he was born at merida state capital of yucatan
7560,yes i see how long did you say it would take you to master salamanders accent
7561,well while weve been talking the security chief i told you about donald bruce has since cordoned off this entire area hes coming here himself now id say youve got about two minutes doctor
7562,will you please listen youll be under arrest for impersonation as soon as he sees you i mean it
7563,but the clothes
7564,a little less eccentric but do the best you can
7565,your friends doctor do you want them to suffer because they will you know
7566,there isnt time
7567,a pity i like to hear you say it now listen to this all of you one of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you the remains of two others were found in what was left of a helicopter you were in that bungalow at the time and there were three other people with you two youngsters and a man right now there was another man wasnt there so well deal with that first where is he
7568,i was under the impression you were in the central european zone leader
7569,why
7570,but thats just it how can i possibly maintain security when you behave like this im at least entitled to know your movements
7571,that may be but only a few days ago you questioned me about this man and his activities and we agreed that he was dangerous now i find you in his office
7572,theyre not holding you here
7573,under some threat or other
7574,i still think i deserve an explanation leader
7575,dont get clever with me kent ive a good mind to
7576,well im not
7577,its beginning to look as if these people are working for you now is that right
7578,i never said a word
7579,you were splendid doctor
7580,it paid off all right are you with us
7581,dont you understand salamander
7582,look were right about salamander it wont take you long to find out for yourselves
7583,we can hardly steal into his study and go through his papers
7584,you could leave almost at once
7585,of course
7586,we have a contact there
7587,he is denes controller of the zone
7588,i think we better have a look at salamanders research station at kanowa
7589,oh its these spots
7590,its all right weve contacted and weve arranged to meet     astrid
7591,no if the plan goes through ill try and contact you again  kent
7592,astrid are you there where shes gone and im not surprised after that last remark
7593,im certain salamanders causing the earthquakes doctor and im sure your friends jamie and victoria will tell you just how bad he really is
7594,years ago doctor when one country wanted to invade another it set about attacking the confidence of that country throwing it into confusion making it weak then it was right for takeover now isnt that exactly whats happening here only in a different way
7595,in spite of a number of reasons he invented the sunstore a brilliant advance he found a way of directing conserved energy to areas starved of sun
7596,all the money he was spending at the research station the materials involved the food stores it didnt make sense i had all the papers all the requisition orders
7597,all destroyed and new ones appeared and i was made out to be the criminal all by suggestion of course i was discredited and every accusation i made against salamander was put down as an attempt to throw suspicion off myself
7598,security quick here
7599,come on now do you believe the sort of people were up against
7600,why wont you believe me
7601,thats what im trying to tell you about salamander hes trying to destroy the world
7602,it was you  or someone like you
7603,astrid should have been in contact by now
7604,ah no otherwise beniks little visit here wouldnt have been so moderate he wouldnt have stopped at breaking up the crockery
7605,if i knew where she was oh no i know shes in the central european zone but thats a big place no well just have to sweat it out and wait
7606,yes its not safe and taking you from place to place isnt easy and i mean youre not exactly inconspicuous are you
7607,fariah
7608,no youre wrong salamander doesnt care for loose ends he brought them back with him
7609,yes hes going to try to get information from them
7610,very far
7611,i tell you i know salamander
7612,i came here for that purpose yes
7613,does it really matter
7614,why i havent tried to expose salamander
7615,because without any proof id be wasting my time
7616,we have some
7617,fedorins file
7618,come on come on
7619,you mean even this doesnt convince you about salamander
7620,and of course when they see you with me theyre bound to think youre salamander
7621,its the only way to get your friends released
7622,of course there are
7623,now look youre giving me the biggest opportunity ill ever have of ridding the world of this monster either i can convince you one way or ill have to do it another
7624,what else do you do when someone is evil
7625,sometimes its necessary
7626,yes doctor yes when the inducement is strong enough and in your case yes you still want your friends out of danger
7627,id make up my mind quickly if i were you
7628,have a look out of the window
7629,and theyre closing in
7630,up there look
7631,over here quick
7632,come on quickly
7633,now you doctor next  benik
7634,excellent
7635,she went the wrong way we lost her
7636,doctor hold still a moment will you
7637,salamander to the life
7638,shush i think i heard something
7639,its amazing how alike you and salamander are incredible you fooled me the first time we met but now even salamander himself would think he was looking in a mirror why you want this man to impersonate salamander why how much are they paying you
7640,they want you to assassinate salamander dont they take his place
7641,but you were preparing to impersonate him werent you
7642,all right then why
7643,and im expected to take that from you
7644,no what
7645,where is this file
7646,fariah but shes dead
7647,all right bruce we might have just thirty seconds but youd have exactly half that time if you were lucky
7648,what
7649,so
7650,and what about your two friends are you going to leave them to the tender mercies of salamander
7651,what
7652,hold it
7653,why whyd you do that
7654,go on
7655,you must be a complete fool or very clever
7656,what do you hope to gain by this gesture
7657,do you believe kents accusations against salamander
7658,by getting into salamanders research station
7659,and if there isnt any evidence
7660,all right ill do it on one condition
7661,why you
7662,doctor
7663,tardis tardis whats that
7664,yes i concede that but theres still no proof
7665,well he must be
7666,but its beyond belief how could he possibly
7667,maybe but thats where salamander is
7668,all right be careful ill get you some water  astrid goes along the tunnel to where water is dribbling down the wall
7669,you have to sign these passes for the hovertruck food supply
7670,well you always told me they had priority over everything
7671,by the way
7672,the door to the record room is jammed it was all right when you came out wasnt it
7673,well it wont open now may i have your key
7674,its all right ill use the emergency key
7675,how long was he standing there listening to us
7676,do you think hes on to us
7677,fewer than youd think its fully automated you know six engineers and six guards on duty at any one time
7678,yes i swear it
7679,sorry
7680,whats all that about
7681,what
7682,what are you going to do
7683,its a sort of space
7684,your little bolthole half way down the tunnel a passage out to the fields and enough explosives down there to stop you or your thugs following me
7685,oh no it cant be
7686,who told them that an atomic war had started
7687,we had to have someone create the natural disasters didnt we and we fooled you all
7688,you didnt suspect me
7689,and i will do you think youre going to stop me and these people now move out of the way quick well see wholl stop me
7690,come on then
7691,what do you mean
7692,look
7693,its the escape route thats salamander
7694,the people underground in the deep shelter
7695,but thats not your fault you couldnt have done more
7696,all right ill go with you
7697,oh no doctor its far too dangerous they might mistake you as salamander
7698,are you hurt
7699,me doctor but you said we were never to touch the controls
7700,thank you youre doing so well impersonating me i thought i might return the compliment
7701,unfortunately he didnt survive the explosion
7702,oh doctor
7703,ill try doctor but ill have to get to a better position
7704,im slipping
7705,i cant
7706,right doctor im going to try and fall to the control panel
7707,made it
7708,so far so good
7709,aye found it im nearly there
7710,oh what happened are we safe now
7711,aye and i nearly joined him
7712,oh lets just get our breath back first before you start tearing off anywhere anyway as you know the tardis has a mind of its own you know you cant control it
7713,no
7714,i wonder where itll be this time
7715,travers travers is that you i am not frightened by your stupid tricks travers i know its you im not a fool
7716,look im not arguing about that

7793,right thats enough diplomacy for one day now lets get down to some practical soldiering doctor youve been very quiet any ideas

7850,what was that
7851,its like a spiders web aint it
7852,doctor been thinking about what you were saying earlier about someone here in hq being responsible for all this could it have been travers

7862,but but there must be a chance if the doctor says
7863,but why why him why not me or one of the soldiers or
7864,we were ready to test the sphere with the control unit but i dont see what this has to do with anything doctor

7906,through time and space i have observed you doctor your mind surpasses that of all other creatures
7907,oh no he will survive his mind unharmed only empty as a newborn childs

7996,well i dont really know how to say this but theres miss travers and victoria to think of and er

8008,soon your mind will be absorbed by the great intelligence you should be very proud doctor your knowledge of the past will help to shape the future of this planet

8015,ruined everything how can we we weve won havent we
8016,what do you mean doctor
8017,you mean all weve done is cut off its contact with earth its still out there in space somewhere flying around
8018,do you mean to say that arnold wasnt the intelligence
8019,you mean it might come back
8020,yes great victory
8021,no you were a hero and you know it

8023,yes i want you on my television programme and
8024,and i want to organise a big press conference and
8025,but the press conference doctor
8026,but doctor doctor you cant go yet there are a lot of things i want to discuss with you
8027,where are you going
8028,oh dear
8029,all these tunnels look the same to me
8030,well it doesnt matter anyway i mean theres no danger is there
8031,trust you to bring us right down in the middle of the sea
8032,where are we exactly
8033,aye you can tell by the weather
8034,aye but not in big lumps like this hey doctor
8035,hey doctor whats that may be thats where the foams coming from
8036,what is it
8037,so its nothing to do with the foam then
8038,will it not budge
8039,whats that
8040,what is it whats that noise
8041,i can hear it too
8042,doctor please hurry up i dont like this place its so quiet i feel as if were being watched
8043,doctor doctor
8044,what happened what do you want
8045,what have they done cant move
8046,eh
8047,i wouldnt try if i were you
8048,shall we give them some u4 sir
8049,oh no
8050,no please
8051,hes not hes a doctor
8052,were in something of an emergency at the moment you see weve just lost contact with one of our rigs at sea
8053,theres also been a drop in pressure in the feed lines from the rigs you were seen tampering with a release valve on the pipe line
8054,maybe not but we were under a security alert and mister robsons well under considerable pressure himself im sorry but i shall have to do as he says and lock you up
8055,im sorry but theres nothing i can do to help you until you tell me what you were doing with that release valve on the pipe line
8056,oh
8057,a movement  oh its all right you can go
8058,and so did i
8059,but thats impossible we spent years of time money and research into perfecting our emergency system
8060,oh i doubt it
8061,chief robson would never agree to that
8062,well he doesnt believe in working to the book he prides himself that the flow has never been shut off ever since he took charge
8063,no you go ahead but youd better have something more than a high flown theory because if you havent im going to take you and chop you up into little pieces and throw you back to your crummy little university all right
8064,all clear
8065,oh hes stuck
8066,yeah
8067,told you not to bother
8068,what was all that
8069,what is it doctor
8070,why not
8071,whats that thing supposed to do
8072,is this the pipeline then
8073,that bit there you can see inside the pipe
8074,hello is anybody there oh come on
8075,aye what is it
8076,help
8077,in here
8078,what happened
8079,oh doctor a horrible creature
8080,didnt you see it it was in there it came straight towards me covered with seaweed and foam and this horrible hissing sound and then i screamed i didnt know
8081,shes telling the truth the door was locked from the outside  van lutyens
8082,well dont stand there thinking about it man do a complete check
8083,what kind of movement
8084,what you heard and what everybody else heard was a mechanical fault somewhere along the line
8085,because my friend underneath this impeller shaft is a vast steel gasometer buried in the earth it acts like an echo chamber itll make the sound of a pin dropping sound like that of a thunder clap it travels along the pipe
8086,all right then suppose there is something in the pipe a fish or something what do you expect me to do about it
8087,if you allow the pressure to build up in the pipeline youll blow the whole rig skyhigh
8088,all right what do you think it is one of these creatures the hysterical girl thought she saw
8089,doctor doctor i need your help its my wife shes very ill
8090,oh no its the same
8091,doctor in here
8092,i think i can hear something
8093,whats the matter with her
8094,it isnt possible there could have been a gas leak in the flat besides natural gas isnt toxic
8095,but where could it have come from
8096,i asked her to get a file from my study and she found the seaweed inside it
8097,well no of course not
8098,doctor
8099,whats this
8100,a bit of seaweed whats it doing in here
8101,perhaps its the same sort that maggie was talking about
8102,why
8103,och away youve seen seaweed before havent you there was loads of it down by the pipeline this morning
8104,now listen will you  its down there in the darkness in the pipeline waiting
8105,but its only a bit of seaweed
8106,oh how can it move its not a living thing is it
8107,well it did move it gave me a shock it was like a spider
8108,whats this for
8109,what are you going to do with it
8110,doctor my wife will she be all right
8111,yes ill go back to the medicare centre at the compound and arrange for her to be taken in there
8112,aye hey i thought we were supposed to be prisoners
8113,what are you doing doctor
8114,i dont know i think you ought to have a look
8115,well i did the bunsen test like you told me but i found something which worried me
8116,no no
8117,yes
8118,hey doctor what are these little wriggly things in the weed
8119,here look look in there
8120,thats it doctor thats the creature i saw back at the compound
8121,but how did it get in this book
8122,thats my time you mean to say this is the creature that victoria saw back at the compound
8123,well what about these great clumps of weed
8124,oh no
8125,what
8126,mister robson wait i need your permission to send two men down the impeller shaft to
8127,oh no
8128,wheres it coming from
8129,whats it doing
8130,mrs harris
8131,now what
8132,what are we going to do  jamie
8133,oh ive come over dizzy
8134,doctor why is it that we always land up in trouble
8135,oh well im not so sure i dont really like been scared out of my wits every second
8136,well i just wish that once oh never mind
8137,if only we knew what we were up against these creatures that have been getting into the refinery where do they come from we dont even know what they are
8138,seaweed
8139,alive but how can it be
8140,its this seaweed thats blocking the pipeline then
8141,we must clear the base of the impeller
8142,you mean human beings but what happens to them
8143,but my wife was stung by the seaweed
8144,well i asked the medicare centre to bring her in price get medicare for me and ask how my wife is now doctor ive just seen one these creature things that your young friend saw in the oxygen room
8145,in mister robsons cabin it might have attacked him he was in a wild state when i went in and just run out he hasnt been seen since
8146,the matron says shes sorry she hasnt brought your wife in yet but shes sending someone over now
8147,what is it doctor
8148,is this right
8149,wait well where do you think she is do you think it has anything to do with this seaweed stuff
8150,three rigs now what can have happened to them
8151,no im afraid i have no authority here im just here as technical adviser mister harris is in charge when he comes back he might possibly authorise the company helicopter for at least to take a look
8152,yes but will he theres so many questions the weed grows feeds off natural gas but how fast does it grow what happens to those that touch it oh jamie jamie im frightened
8153,yes
8154,up there hes still asleep nothing would wake him except a bomb dropping
8155,doctor whats happening
8156,i heard that noise again
8157,well what are they doing about it
8158,wait but what for for one of those awful creatures to come and attack us all
8159,isnt it even you dont know really how bad is it do you
8160,every time we go anywhere something awful happens daleks cybermen
8161,robson
8162,i think so
8163,tot straks
8164,whats happened to him
8165,hes not in the shaft he must still be down there lets find mister harris
8166,what are we going to do
8167,oh no were not
8168,oh doctor you cant you dont know whats down there
8169,gloomy sort of place isnt it
8170,hey isnt that van lutyens torch
8171,but where is he
8172,i dont know i just dont know
8173,well no point in hanging about here
8174,get us out of here
8175,you all right
8176,what a climb
8177,lets get out of this in case then wheres victoria
8178,victoria wouldnt desert us
8179,let him go the strain must have affected his mind
8180,and who are you
8181,doctor ive almost forgotten what about van lutyens did you
8182,have you any idea what happened
8183,what happened to mister van lutyens and mister robson
8184,you think this seaweed or what ever it is is a living organism capable of exercising telepathic control
8185,but seaweeds a vegetable matter everyone knows that
8186,but where does the weed get this intelligence from doctor
8187,you mean the creatures have taken over human beings
8188,yes but wheres it coming from victoria look
8189,with what objective
8190,is such a thing possible
8191,but how can we possibly do that it could be anywhere out there in the north sea
8192,doctor
8193,quickly come and see
8194,its here its come up
8195,i dont understand whats happening
8196,doctor dont go near
8197,well keep trying man
8198,i dont care about the rigs whats happened to the crews
8199,no
8200,why not
8201,well what are we going to do
8202,what can it do
8203,no no anything that comes up through the bores would be cleared by the engineers at the source otherwise it would block the pumps
8204,yes so they must have been amongst the first to be controlled
8205,how do you mean
8206,if your theory is correct the weed now controls two people who know the entire layout and structure of this whole compound
8207,doctor theres one thing that doesnt fit in with your theory
8208,when victoria was locked in the oxygen room now shes nothing to do with the personnel here
8209,someone wearing a gas mask
8210,because to him pure oxygen would be toxic
8211,well then we can use the oxygen as a weapon against the weed
8212,well as mister harris said before youve been right so far theres no reason why you shouldnt be now
8213,well doctor have you thought of a way in which we can attack this weed doctor
8214,well have you any idea what it might do next
8215,but why
8216,but where is the nerve centre
8217,and were not sure yet quite how to destroy it are we
8218,well what about the oxygen
8219,they seem to be one step ahead of us all the time
8220,you mean apart from robson and van lutyens
8221,how will we find out who they are
8222,well we must do a personnel check now theres a fingerprint file in security
8223,doctor i shall need your help
8224,that soon put paid to him didnt it didnt know what hit him did he
8225,theres a wee bit of power left in the old mccrimmon punch yet
8226,whats happened to it doctor
8227,is there no way of stopping it
8228,what do you mean this horrible stuffs growing all the time
8229,doctor look at that
8230,wheres victoria
8231,victoria
8232,i thought she was with you
8233,wheres she gone
8234,hey
8235,they wont open
8236,theyre closed too
8237,doctor have you found her yet
8238,but she was standing right beside us
8239,im afraid hes got your young girl with him
8240,yes sir
8241,yes
8242,listen listen    robson
8243,what did he mean come over to us
8244,you mean they want you
8245,but you wont go surely
8246,you cant go with that man you can see hes not responsible
8247,harris if we let this man go now what hope have we got
8248,hey doctor one of those towers is all covered in white
8249,robsons helicopter
8250,we cant land there
8251,but the driver will he wait for us
8252,where do we go from here
8253,its like walking into the lions den
8254,its very quiet do you think victoria really is down here
8255,i suppose youre right vic
8256,see i was right
8257,whats the matter
8258,well i would set oh i see you think it might be a trap
8259,you are going to help our new masters they need you
8260,with the conquest of the human planet  victoria
8261,the mind does not exist it is tired it is dead it is obsolete only our new masters can offer us life
8262,the body does not exist soon we shall all be one
8263,you cannot escape you must join us you must join us you will join us
8264,no no no stop stop stop stop
8265,yes should we lock him in
8266,dont worry victoria it wont hurt you
8267,oh cant he see us
8268,hes probably just too scared
8269,but well never get of the rig without it
8270,but it hasnt got a driver
8271,oh the foam doctor i cant see
8272,i hope you know what youre doing
8273,thats the only time
8274,doctor look out
8275,what
8276,look out    pilot
8277,and when it does attack how do you expect to fight it with what weapons
8278,and my wife
8279,no theres not much hope is there what can we do how can we fight this hideous thing
8280,but even if we succeed in fighting of the weed what about those people already affected by it
8281,what
8282,but how why what killed the weed
8283,how did you find out
8284,i did
8285,i screamed
8286,so thats why the crews on the rigs spoke softly the noise affected them
8287,half an hour wont make that much difference doctor what do you think we can do
8288,its too late well never stop it now
8289,its impossible i tell you its seeping in from every corner of the compound
8290,but you said yourself you dont know where the nerve centre is
8291,thats the control rig
8292,but how will you get it there
8293,yes i realise that but there isnt time
8294,yes thats about all weve got but youre right we must try
8295,the transmitter and loud speakers down below sir
8296,whats this all about doctor
8297,but do you think this idea will work
8298,yes sir
8299,scream
8300,oh come on doctor
8301,oh doctor
8302,she cant scream sir
8303,jamie you cant scream just like that
8304,run dont just stand there
8305,open your eyes miss jones cant you see whats happening were gradually being strangled i cant risk the lives of these men here any longer
8306,good
8307,all right all right what do you want us to do
8308,what does that do
8309,you mean like a laser light beam
8310,yes but will it destroy the weed here
8311,how
8312,with what
8313,look there
8314,whats the current
8315,chief chief quick
8316,back chief back
8317,those doors wont hold
8318,look out
8319,its not working
8320,no look
8321,doctor it worked
8322,doctor youve done it
8323,what about the weeds nerve centre at the control rig
8324,do you think weve destroyed that
8325,well doctor i dont quite know what to say except thank you
8326,i still cant believe it
8327,i dont know im always frightened
8328,oh doctor i cant
8329,doctor theyre safe
8330,i cant
8331,oh i doubt it would have helped as it turned out we were lucky we didnt tamper with the weed
8332,to think i wanted to keep you locked up doctor
8333,that was a very splendid dinner mrs harris now if youll excuse me im very tired
8334,see you in the morning doctor
8335,oh dear where are you going
8336,if youre ever around here again do drop in and in the front gate this time just to avoid any unfortunate incidents
8337,good night bye mrs harris
8338,hey victoria wakey wakey whats the matter
8339,i dont know i dont really want to leave you
8340,victoria you cant
8341,im sorry
8342,yes
8343,look well talk it over later
8344,we cant just leave her
8345,im not im just och come on lets go
8346,i couldnt care less
8347,im not im just och come on lets go
8348,i couldnt care less
8349,huh
8350,oh
8351,i thought you said wed landed
8352,are you sure youre pushing the right one
8353,no its all right here
8354,no
8355,what oh you know i cant hear you when you talk to yourself
8356,the size of it
8357,its a wee bit quick isnt it look its changed again whats going on
8358,why do they keep appearing then
8359,eh
8360,the red lights stopped flashing
8361,something must be wrong
8362,doctor look under here
8363,but how
8364,what are you going to do
8365,doctor whats happened to the tardis
8366,the what
8367,where are we
8368,a rocket
8369,what does that do
8370,oh theres no water around is there
8371,were on the ground then
8372,whats the matter well dont keep me in suspense whats happened
8373,doctor the warning mechanism obviously thought there was something wrong out here but what i mean everythings so well dead isnt it
8374,what
8375,shall we open the door
8376,looks safe enough
8377,stores in that one
8378,id have thought a rocket this size would have carried more than two people
8379,oh the tardis must have gone mad then i mean theres nothing on board here so theres no danger
8380,whats it matter
8381,well all right stick your rod dimen
8382,aye stick it back in and well float off somewhere else
8383,well there must be some on board here surely
8384,well theres got to be
8385,well we wont find that out till we look inside that control room will we
8386,me too no the only place we havent searched is that control room
8387,and perhaps well find some food in that machine as well
8388,something a bit more substantial please
8389,well right now id like a nice plate of roast beef with all the trimmings
8390,what are you doing
8391,well yes
8392,potatoes
8393,and cabbage
8394,fruit salad yes
8395,i dont think so
8396,am i supposed to eat this
8397,ive heard of a square meal but this is ridiculous
8398,doctor what do you think victorias doing now
8399,you know what i mean
8400,aye well what do we do now
8401,tell me though what do you think happened to the crew
8402,were moving the rockets moving
8403,lets have a look
8404,doctor the mercury stuff
8405,doctor theres a great big silver thing out here
8406,back to the cabin quick
8407,because the doctor told me to protect it
8408,well i had to stop them destroying the rocket didnt i
8409,of course i did i mean what about the tardis a fine thing if theyd blown that to pieces
8410,anyway what are you going to tell them
8411,you dont remember
8412,well i found you lying in the corridor near that locked control room something had just shaken up the rocket and tumbled me out of bed and well whatever it was must have made you stumble as well
8413,you honestly cant remember
8414,well what about the machine then the one that was going to attack you now surely you remember that
8415,you and your friend are healthy specimens arent you
8416,no im afraid not just yet
8417,does your head ache
8418,any loss of memory
8419,does it make you anxious
8420,probably but dont strain to remember concussion can bring about temporary lapses in memory there is quite a lot we dont know about the memory bank yet you know good i suppose the part that you cant remember is why you told jamie to protect the rocket
8421,probably not
8422,is it all right the guard said you are here
8423,aye were under arrest
8424,how did you pilot the rocket doctor
8425,john  john
8426,with honours
8427,you didnt answer my question
8428,how did you pilot the rocket ship you see ive calculated its original course it was a service and supply station for number five station overdue and presumed lost nine weeks ago well the rocket couldnt drift eighty seven million miles off course
8429,theres only one solution that rocket was refuelled in space provided with at least with another twelve fuel rods
8430,oh it isnt a theory you cant disprove the facts its pure logic
8431,to drive a rocket eighty seven million miles on fuel for twenty million
8432,the controllers mounted an immediate enquiry im much more interested in this
8433,yes i had to get one of the men to take a floor plate up you just cant cut through hyperoxide its polymer strength is higher than chrome steel
8434,oh it means that theres er
8435,aye
8436,completely weve got a few spares but not half enough well have to get more up from earth
8437,do you think theres a connection
8438,aye well just supposing they planted a saboteur on board waiting for the right moment along drifts the rocket and were abroad the saboteur thinks this is the right moment and strikes
8439,well if he was caught messing about with the bernalium stuff he may had to kill
8440,but it fits
8441,och its just a spare part or something the dead man tried to defend himself used the quick set plastic it misfired and went over this bit of machinery
8442,how
8443,well all i had to go on was the fact that hyperoxide is unbreakable i just didnt think of xrays
8444,the xrays are processed now can you turn out the light jamie
8445,whats that
8446,aye
8447,that means the cybermen must be here too
8448,i know all there is to know about cybernetics i dont need a lecture from you
8449,well what are these cybermen then
8450,you mean half and half
8451,you really expect me to believe that rubbish
8452,nothing just comes in and out of this wheel what do you think this is a jet heliport
8453,dont try and tell me my job gemma i am still controller of this wheel and things will be run in my way any orders to the contrary can come from earth central thats what
8454,jarvis was right about one thing doctor these cybermen of yours cant just walk into the wheel you know
8455,im definite i thought id come across some strange space creature
8456,of course not bill after all you discovered space flora out here when you found the cybermat you obviously thought that it was space fauna
8457,maybe so doc but look at what happened when i did tell the old man
8458,id better take you back bill ive got some new calculations to do on those meteorites half of the space fleet might be flying straight into them
8459,they nearly did
8460,well i assume they did they seem to have taken a liking to all the stock of bernalium on board the laser needs constant supplies of bernalium rods
8461,i see right enough if i havent put the laser out of action the cybermats would have
8462,its obvious put the wheel out of action and make it defenceless
8463,magnetic field deflectors the meson shield they can counteract small meteorites
8464,come on i know how to get to the bernalium dont i
8465,i dare say your headll ache for a quite a while yet but at least theres no damage
8466,mrs
8467,my husband died in the asteroid belt three years ago
8468,my names gemma
8469,tell you what
8470,in ordinary circumstances no
8471,jarvis is simply a man who cant accept phenomena outside the laws of physics
8472,were you going to say diagnosis
8473,you see in this failing of his a medical weakness
8474,normally hes more than capable of commanding this station its a continuous and merciless responsibility
8475,but you need rest you really shouldnt get up yet
8476,but its much too soon
8477,you cant leave this room jarvis has given orders
8478,yes everythings going very well very well indeed you must want to stretch your legs get someone to take you round
8479,and this last one is how we check everything
8480,yes anything that uses energy on the wheel however small is registered on this wall from a coffeegrinder upwards
8481,would you like some
8482,i have a coffee pellet would you like one
8483,excuse me doctor tanya
8484,doctor dont forget we need that mercury stuff for the tardis
8485,lets find out
8486,facts are facts and these are indisputable
8487,well thats not the worry its the controller i went to him with the new data on the meteorites and he just brushed the whole thing aside
8488,that what doctor corwyn says he is ill isnt he
8489,oh no some more turned up
8490,yes two of the men bought a crate of it over from the rocket
8491,well thats what flannigan said i met him when he was going off duty
8492,yes tanya told me
8493,but how could our two men have bought them over
8494,the cybermen hypnotised them
8495,were not exactly children doctor all spacemen are protected against braincontrol by drugs
8496,no but then theres the implanted silenski capsules it gives off a signal when there is an adverse influence against the wearer
8497,watch the lines if theyre steady then everything is normal
8498,try this room first
8499,someone in this room
8500,ill quarter the room off over there in the direction of
8501,i can do that
8502,ill help you
8503,what do we do
8504,are you sure you know whos going to be hunted
8505,doctor
8506,there it is
8507,is this it here
8508,how could they get in here
8509,that was close
8510,what
8511,what are you talking about
8512,yes i see what you mean what do you think they are planning
8513,what do they want then
8514,how
8515,food
8516,im not sure why i do but i do sealing off the airlocks is good common sense anyway
8517,doctor its turning
8518,all right all right thats it power more come on come on
8519,all right zoe put it away somewhere complete withdrawal loss of effect
8520,i can try ect he could be shocked back to normal
8521,no its in the medical bay
8522,yes
8523,enough to keep anything out the crew have been warned oh
8524,dont force him give him whatever he wants
8525,but can they still control our people i thought youd
8526,no not yet there are still some crew members without
8527,fifty thousand miles total destruction ninety thousand partial
8528,well letem all come were ready for them
8529,deliberately causing the meteorites to deflect from their orbit to destroy the wheel you mean
8530,and then youd search that drifting rocket and find a big crate
8531,aye
8532,they must have done otherwise theyd be smashing up the wheel wouldnt they
8533,what
8534,but how can we stop them
8535,presumably these cybermen disposed of the crewmembers of the rocket in space
8536,oh you mean the gold rod thing
8537,youve got it i put it your pocket in the rocket
8538,yes
8539,you must have not unless its fallen out when they were moving you is it important
8540,good luck to them whos going
8541,me
8542,mine
8543,do you i wouldnt be too sure if i were you
8544,shed no right to agree and youve got no right to let her
8545,have you any idea of the dangers theyll face between the wheel and the rocket and youve send zoe and your friend out into an area which is bound to be bombarded with small debris quite apart from the radiation and the thermal shock
8546,thank you       corwyn
8547,angle change ten degrees
8548,tell leo ryan to switch over to the sectional supply unit
8549,and fire
8550,were hitting them
8551,theyll be blown out of space
8552,the screens clear sir weve done it main body deflected
8553,watch out for smaller meteorites rico now then you know what youve done dont you those two kids out there have probably either been burnt up by radiation or fried by thermal blast always assuming of course they werent actually hit by any of that rubbish
8554,why
8555,and that justified risking two lives
8556,what are you talking about
8557,how do you know
8558,where is she
8559,right well ill talk to her
8560,theyre turning weve deflected them
8561,to bring him back
8562,but what possible use could the wheel be to these cybermen doctor
8563,i dont see why you dont accept my theory that theyre simply attacking us
8564,anyway its too big for one of our ships
8565,moving in for the kill
8566,right  flannigan
8567,you well surely its better if i go
8568,right
8569,and he isnt coming here didnt you hear him hes going to meet you in corridor six
8570,return to the operations room destroy the force field after they let you through
8571,company what does he mean  company
8572,oh it looks like the doctors already made one of them pay
8573,right leave that to me
8574,well i think i know just the thing for him
8575,he is not important
8576,all set
8577,oh we can go then
8578,well its impossible
8579,no i wont
8580,what are you going to do
8581,thought patterns
8582,no
8583,that was unnecessary
8584,are you still feeling tired doctor
8585,you need a good rest doctor
8586,aye
8587,and there wont be any cybermen or daleks will there
8588,well is the whole island as dreary as this
8589,oh i see youve been here before
8590,eh
8591,did you say these people were peaceful doctor
8592,aye it sounded like it did the explosion cause this
8593,looks like atomic blast damage to me
8594,looks like some sort of museum
8595,peaceful you said
8596,hey how you work this sort of thing
8597,whats the matter
8598,is that the trigger there
8599,whats happened to them
8600,well what are you laughing at oh theyre just dummies what did they put them in here for
8601,dummies did you check
8602,did you check the radiation level before we left the tardis
8603,well i was just thinking this place reminds me of the old atomtest islands on earth
8604,for atomic weapons jamie
8605,no thats true teel as theyre not radioactive we may as well let them out
8606,ridiculous
8607,yes so ive noticed its odd isnt it
8608,of course it is
8609,well not yet weve only just arrived well be taking the annual readings during the next few days
8610,i wasnt aware that anyone else had permission to work on the island except ourselves tell me exactly what has been happening
8611,ah well we dont
8612,ah well thats it you see weve just come in the tar
8613,were part of educator balans expedition from the university
8614,ah so youve been here before
8615,ah i must put that in my im so sorry you were saying
8616,oh indeed they have under the second council under director olin he banned the manufacture of all weapons
8617,oh well she certainly does her homework
8618,but there isnt
8619,i reproved you at the time of your precipitate act of selfgratification in destroying those three creatures it will now be necessary to find other specimens they will have to be investigated
8620,well it is conceivable that your craft the er
8621,the tardis could have attracted the radioactivity in much the same way as a magnet attracts metal
8622,you didnt tell me you brought robots
8623,now i see it yes three people so you come from another world do you doctor
8624,whats he talking about
8625,well go on then why dont you call him up at least hes not as stupid as you are
8626,well ive told you havent i and robots well at least i think they were robots
8627,ah that means it cant be the tardis
8628,no no thats not the spacecraft no the box is where those aliens have made a sort of mark a five pointed star they were examining just now talking about destroying it  doctor  jamie  zoe
8629,youre wasting your time
8630,no i think ill stay here
8631,come on then
8632,certain
8633,ah at least they havent harmed the tardis
8634,what
8635,oh whats so interesting about that
8636,very likely
8637,so they are
8638,hey look at that
8639,oh look i think wed better get back zoell be wondering whats happening
8640,oh no youre not thinking what i think youre thinking are you
8641,och hey doctor
8642,doctor
8643,doctor look
8644,next task shall we destroy shall we destroy
8645,i will not
8646,not by me youre not
8647,alien races are occasionally of use to us i intend to probe your physiological make up
8648,doctor can you not do anything
8649,oh if i could only get away from this wall
8650,er what are they saying
8651,tests what for
8652,oh you mean theyre going to find out how clever we are
8653,oh so it seems we only have your word for it cully and experience has taught us how little that can be relied upon
8654,you mean those wee shapes in that big box what for
8655,och if thats all it is a kid of two could do it
8656,you moved
8657,me too
8658,no
8659,sit
8660,that will be repeated again at regular intervals until the puzzle is reassembled
8661,hurry up doctor
8662,here quick sniff sniff thats it come away come away from that fearful contraption are you all right
8663,what were you up to that puzzle was easy
8664,eh
8665,oh thank you
8666,i said get up
8667,come with me
8668,jump
8669,a simple circuit completed by your bodies you obviously know little of electricity
8670,are you such a fool you have intelligent eyes i will continue the test personally bring
8671,oh there is no such spacecraft nor are there any robots
8672,explain it to me
8673,firepower potential
8674,what does it do
8675,fire it
8676,well ill try er you put a cork or something in there and something
8677,oh ill get the hang of it doctor
8678,are you sure
8679,clever ones
8680,there are two distinct types on this planet
8681,how many of these clever ones are there
8682,we have nothing to fear from such creatures it would be a waste of energy to destroy them leave them stay away from us and the quarks
8683,am i glad thats over
8684,aye what do you think theyre after
8685,and then this fleet of theirs would refuel land and pick it up it makes sense
8686,aye nasty little beasties hey doctor theyve gone wed better get back to that survey place zoell be wondering whats happening
8687,this will take you direct to the capital doctor your young friend zoe is already there no doubt director senex is awaiting your arrival
8688,no
8689,what do you thinks happened to her doctor
8690,as far as we know she left with my son cully presumably they have returned to the island
8691,no there are no prisoners on dulkis
8692,you mean they dont fight they dont have any armies
8693,the identity of my sons companions can now been established although what has happened to them is not quite clear
8694,why
8695,you creatures follow
8696,evidently you were not
8697,these dominators they let you go free why should we fear them
8698,well so are you doctor
8699,patience young man doctor what in your opinion do this dominators want
8700,oh there are no valuable minerals here they are welcome to whatever they can find there is no cause for alarm
8701,what are they talking about
8702,aye well the dominators dont know anything about your gentleness
8703,oh very well
8704,balan balan are you there
8705,look
8706,what is that
8707,thats a quark now come on weve wasted enough time
8708,well i suppose you know what youre doing
8709,well this contraptions homing back on that survey place right
8710,hey have you gone daft or something
8711,hey you cant just take things to pieces not when were flying at heaven knows what speed
8712,well i did try to warn you
8713,oh hey are there not any ordinary controls for flying this thing
8714,the simplest
8715,hey what are you doing in there
8716,you think you mean youre not sure
8717,take it easy
8718,hey can you land the thing
8719,aye but in one piece
8720,nothing except wait
8721,more by luck than by judgement if you ask me what a landing
8722,cant remember
8723,its zoe and cully
8724,what are you doing you were told to keep away from the quarks
8725,on the orders of dominator toba the building was destroyed also the man cully
8726,quarks take these specimens back to the drilling site await the arrival of dominator toba you two over there
8727,what was all that about
8728,and this leader senex he is in the capital city
8729,quark molecular force
8730,i asked you a question
8731,well
8732,these dulcian travel machines how do i summon one
8733,yes by toba prepare this ship for take off
8734,i have no alternative
8735,how big is this space machine will it transport a quark
8736,then it is useless to our purpose we will use our own machine
8737,you will show me this machine
8738,quark prepare to transmit recorded data on work habits of tested specimens contact direct fleet leader
8739,why did you tell him about the capsule
8740,but why do you want to
8741,silence you will lead me to this travel craft
8742,quark release the female follow
8743,hmm a primitive machine but functional the circuits need repairing minimal task so you were telling the truth
8744,command accepted
8745,well im sorry but i havent had a chance balan told us about it and with any luck jamie and cully might have found their way down there
8746,and if they have they should be all right shouldnt they
8747,you two follow me
8748,what are they up to
8749,not a chance with this thing guarding us
8750,somebody destroyed a quark but who
8751,jamie then he and cully are alive
8752,what are you looking for
8753,well the quarks use ultrasound so presumably it must be a fuel capable of producing a high enough energy quotient to sustain an amplifying complex of considerably sophisticated design
8754,yes well thats what well if you dont want my help
8755,well if the quarks do use ultrasound to propel this craft
8756,oh no well what do you think they use then not solid fuel rockets surely
8757,atomic fission reactor
8758,yes i feel sure it was jamie
8759,oh they cant drill too deep here because the crust is too thin
8760,but this whole operation was to refuel their fleet but how
8761,doctor
8762,what are they doing
8763,well yes i know that but what for
8764,well what
8765,theyre gone
8766,its thanks to you and jamie that the rest of us are safe
8767,surely they dont mean to destroy dulkis completely
8768,but why what do they want
8769,but we know that there are no minerals worth having at least not on this side of the island
8770,but their spaceships use atomic power weve established that
8771,yes so youre saying that they store radioactive particles and then convert that energy into power
8772,but then why are they drilling
8773,oh
8774,and that will almost certainly fracture the crust of the planet
8775,but that will create a volcano and if they explode the atomic seed device in the middle of that
8776,well well just have to stop them then
8777,yes then thered only be a local volcanic eruption on the island
8778,how can we get to the device
8779,doctor ive just had an idea
8780,yes now listen you said they were going to drop it down the centre hole the one theyre drilling outside here
8781,well its simple isnt it all weve got to do is dig a tunnel through from here to the borehole and catch the seed device thing on its way down well it was just an idea
8782,we can get the direction from the periscope just line it up with the drilling site
8783,yes certainly seems to stop them working
8784,i doubt it nothing but survival rations and medical kits
8785,right er on a line from here
8786,thats it cully ill start it off with a knife now this line here
8787,how are you going to dig through there with your sonic screwdriver
8788,ive no idea look doctor i dont think we should wait you know
8789,what in here
8790,all right
8791,seven eight doctor
8792,you could have blown us all to kingdom come
8793,theyve started again
8794,a little bit further than my own length
8795,i hope jamie and cully are all right
8796,oh we must be merely six feet or so from the borehole i can hear their drill
8797,is there any sign of jamie and cully
8798,oh that was close
8799,doctor theyve started drilling again the blast didnt destroy that quark and tobas managed to get the drill working again
8800,he was hit by a quark lucky for him its power levels were low
8801,my arm seems to be paralysed
8802,oh dont worry about me get on with the tunnel
8803,doctor i think the dominators have finished drilling too
8804,theyre coming back tobas bringing the seed device
8805,were saved were saved
8806,what
8807,you mean all that was for nothing were still going to get blown up
8808,have you thought of something
8809,well how
8810,whatre you going to do
8811,but whatre you going
8812,where is it
8813,whats that
8814,doctor come on will ye the whole place is going to blow up
8815,maybe so but we happen to be on the island
8816,doctor come on will you look
8817,beautiful a great river of molten lava rolling any minute
8818,something wrong
8819,mercury vapour
8820,well we cant stay here well be buried by that lava its nearly on us look
8821,listen will you two stop gaping at that and get us out of here
8822,are you sure
8823,i mean has the tardis ever been buried up to its neck in lava before
8824,well how can you be so sure were going to be all right
8825,reading nine eight seven point three
8826,point four
8827,five
8828,six its jumped to nine nine one point no its going up by numerals
8829,its reached the thousand danger mark doctor
8830,have you done it
8831,are we on our way
8832,well isnt there any way we can get away
8833,but this is an emergency
8834,well fine realitys getting too hot anyway
8835,ah there you are were all right what was all the panic all about

8837,ah but were safe arent we i mean were out of that lava stuff and were all right here
8838,doctor were not actually in flight are we
8839,well then presumably weve landed so why isnt the scanner showing anything
8840,doctor
8841,oh nothing its all exactly the same
8842,youre worried by something doctor what is it
8843,but if theres nothing outside the tardis and were nowhere then what is there to worry about
8844,because its dangerous to stay where we are for any longer yes but we must be safe at the moment otherwise the unit wouldnt let us stay here would it
8845,well curious yes
8846,but doctor i still think we should go out and see
8847,oh come on
8848,no it was definitely scotland zoe thought she saw something else her home city or something but no it was very misty and she couldnae have seen right

8893,find him search search perhaps some light will help
8894,spread out cover the whole area slowly keep moving look left to right search every inch of the forest i know the doctor is here somewhere hmm no sign of him well he cant be far away well continue on this course track him down those are your orders he must be found

8926,well he was charging straight for me head down ready for the kill when suddenly everything went crazy and i was off
8927,in the fog i mean really ever since the tardis broke up
8928,it broke up it fell to bits the next thing i knew i was wandering about here i heard you calling but i couldnt find you  zoe
8929,it sounds as if shes over there
8930,theres no handle theres no sign of a lock either
8931,but thats crazy how do you open a door that isnt a door
8932,whats the good of thinking what we want is a battering ram
8933,one of these trees
8934,och this is no time for riddles
8935,eh
8936,oh you
8937,well why does he look so different
8938,aye this place gives me the creeps
8939,is that really jamie
8940,but he couldnt just have changed like that i mean its impossible
8941,if only we could see over these trees doctor if you could give me a leg up i could shin up one of them
8942,aye i think so its a bit tricky but im nearly there
8943,i can see all right do you know what this tree is
8944,its a letter s the next ones an l and then an o and a w its a forest of words
8945,slow but sure in for a penny
8946,i think so yes yes
8947,oh doctor
8948,sir
8949,how do you do sir
8950,but weve got to get away
8951,no no i looked upon myself to be fully settled for life
8952,the master
8953,army as to their military affairs i knew not what they meant
8954,i knew not what they meant
8955,well what do we do
8956,but i said there was no army here
8957,and now sir i must forebear to trouble you further having answered the only objections you have raised against me i now take a final leave of you all
8958,hey but wait a bit
8959,doctor these soldiers am i mad or do they look like toy soldiers
8960,why have they brought us here
8961,you know ive got a funny sort of a feeling ive been here before
8962,its getting nearer its coming this way
8963,its looking at us
8964,its coming straight for us run
8965,we dont stand a chance
8966,oh doctor
8967,come on this is my dream
8968,its real
8969,what happened
8970,it was terrifying
8971,who the master
8972,but i dont understand
8973,but we believed in it jamie and i
8974,who would think up a crazy notion like this
8975,theres no sign of the toy soldiers now
8976,jamie doctor
8977,whats that
8978,you did this before
8979,and thats how jamies face got changed you got it all wrong
8980,jamie
8981,i have
8982,oh youre right i have oh thats much better ah the house
8983,it would be easy to get lost in there
8984,whats he found
8985,why
8986,then we are meant to go on
8987,but that means that wherever we go at any time they know
8988,theyre expecting us
8989,ah at last the doctor is commendably prompt i wonder how long it will take him to get to the heart of the mystery
8990,to the right
8991,doctor
8992,yes but doctor
8993,the threads run out now should we not go back
8994,ah
8995,i was right this isnt the way out were in the middle of the maze oh doctor i dont like it lets go
8996,well i hope you were
8997,oh
8998,it couldnt be
8999,well i know its silly but do you remember the story of the minotaur
9000,and he lived in the heart of a labyrinth and there were human sacrifices
9001,its going to attack
9002,but its there
9003,its gone
9004,his jacket
9005,jamie whos that
9006,your servant sir
9007,i would not impose any falsities upon you i adhere strictly to truth
9008,the master yes
9009,upon occasion he has been pleased to grant me an audience
9010,the masters palace is no ordinary edifice but a citadel a walled town at the top of a hill or cliff which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom
9011,my father had a small estate in nottingham sir i was the third of five sons he sent me to emmanuel college in cambridge at fourteen years old where i applied myself close to my studies learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics
9012,gulliver
9013,i should like that above all things but it would not be proper at this juncture to trouble you with the particulars of my adventures
9014,having been condemned by nature and fortune to a restless and active life i must take my leave of you farewell
9015,why does he talk in such an extraordinary way
9016,but thats ridiculous i mean there never was such a person as gulliver hes a fictional character
9017,then what are we doing here what do they want with us
9018,the doctor and zoe unable to find their companion in the labyrinth decide to return to the cave in search of him where a new terror awaited them
9019,i believe youre actually beginning to enjoy all this that wasnt there before was it
9020,like the unicorn
9021,what
9022,it is coming to life
9023,the doctor and zoe were face to face with medusa one glance from her eyes would turn them to stone
9024,yes shes moving shes going to look at us
9025,but she does
9026,but shes alive
9027,shes real
9028,i can feel her fingertips like ice
9029,well thats it youre meant to use the sword like perseus
9030,oh doctor please
9031,ive got to open my eyes ive got to see
9032,yes
9033,this was altogether impossible
9034,its an awful long way to climb
9035,its the karkus
9036,obey or i fire
9037,its an antimolecular ray disintegrator
9038,quickly doctor say it you know hes a fictional character
9039,lesson seventeen
9040,lesson thirty two
9041,i know it
9042,we all follow his adventures in the strip sections of the hourly telepress
9043,youve been in the year two thousand havent you
9044,well you better start following this one hes half way up that cliff come on
9045,k a r k u s
9046,i obey
9047,we cant just ring the bell and ask to go in
9048,oh doctor are you sure this is a good idea    master
9049,whats that
9050,jamie
9051,oh doctor did you hear that
9052,be careful
9053,i was chased by one of those tin soldiers luckily i climbed up the cliff up here hey the thing is how do we get out
9054,there you are you see
9055,if you would take my advice swear a peace with the master and his kingdom find yourselves a place to lodge stay quietly with the expectation that things would mend
9056,youre not really going to do as he says are you
9057,ah medusa yes i read about that on this machine here wee words keep coming out of it all the time
9058,look
9059,there look
9060,well i wish i was
9061,yes
9062,oh thats horrible come on lets get out of here
9063,before its too late
9064,its all right
9065,i mean thats funny gulliver walked through there
9066,theyre coming where can we hide
9067,why not if they find us
9068,you mean just stand here and wait
9069,look
9070,oh yes indeed we have to be the running of this place requires enormous attention to detail its a responsible position but very rewarding
9071,not to someone another power higher than you could begin to imagine oh i must congratulate you on the great skill in which you tackled the various stages of your examination
9072,i left england in the summer of nineteen twenty six it was a very hot day i remember i think i must have dozed off over my desk and when i awoke oh but that a long story did you ever hear of the adventures of captain jack harkaway
9073,the ensign
9074,and for twenty five years i delivered five thousand words every week
9075,in one sense yes
9076,my brain is the source of the creative power which keeps this operation going
9077,yes lets it gives me the creeps
9078,well look you keep him talking and zoe and me will find another way out
9079,oh im so sorry to have kept you waiting now where were we
9080,no lets try down there
9081,exactly this is one field in which the intelligence i serve cannot compete they need man a man of boundless imagination as a powerhouse a lifeline as you might say
9082,well as you see im no longer young where as you doctor are ageless you exist outside the barriers of time and space
9083,to take over this unique situation to take my place
9084,resistance is useless submit your will for the sake of the greater good it has been decided
9085,you will find there is only one decision open to you mission accomplished procedure as arranged
9086,the latest chapter of the serial story ill read you the last sentence zoe and jamie attempted to escape but in making it through the library they were ambushed by a party of guards and were overpowered
9087,push open up its closing no
9088,theyre no longer human beings just fictional characters now if you consent to take my place here they can be released
9089,no my dear sir you would once you have taken up your post here it could be your first official task as the new controller
9090,i take it then that you agree
9091,im sorry to have to use violent methods but you must submit you have no alternative
9092,you cannot escape but we will play your game a little longer
9093,oh am i glad to see you
9094,the tardis broke up
9095,im tired i think ill sit down and have a rest
9096,we cant do that it broke up do you not remember
9097,the tardis broke up
9098,i am at your command
9099,zis is want you want
9100,ah wait

9106,always happy to be of assistance
9107,yes whats going on
9108,isnt there anything we can do to help
9109,i never saw it before
9110,the time has come
9111,to leave
9112,come on we must get away
9113,not yet  doctor
9114,and now perhaps we can get down to business as you refused to take over my post at the controls we have been forced to incorporate you into the computer itself
9115,to bring the whole planet earth under our control
9116,we have no wish to destroy them merely adjust their minds to suit our purpose
9117,man will simply vanish from the earth and reappear here
9118,precisely
9119,you have no alternative you are part of the master brain
9120,correct
9121,oh no no no no no youre now under the control of the master brain
9122,submit
9123,oh no no no stop stop
9124,oh oh dear this is against everything we ever worked for warning warning emergency action emergency emergency
9125,soldiers to the roof immediately
9126,soldiers forward seize them destroy them
9127,we obey our creator that is all that is expected of any character unless the master bids us otherwise
9128,with jamie and zoe fixed firmly in his sights the karkus pressed the trigger of his gun
9129,suddenly a swashbuckling figure appeared poet and swordsman    master
9130,remove him
9131,zoe lets get out of here and duck
9132,shouldnt we get out of here

9231,no true im not quite so much of a sceptic as i was since that little escapade
9232,thank you
9233,lay on some tea will you youd like some tea wouldnt you doctor
9234,not really you see my men were keeping a watch on the international electromatic headquarters when you two showed up ive been keeping a check on everyone going in that building your photographs were transmitted to this headquarters and i recognised you
9235,this is gordon jones lecturer in physics churchill college cambridge next ones a chap i knew at sandhurst old billy rutlidge hes got himself a very cushy number at the ministry of defence
9236,no no most of them came out again but there was something definitely odd about them when they did
9237,do you know this man
9238,ah well he did say something about some security guards on his tail
9239,oh yes weve met him a nice man he gave me this
9240,oh yes thats just the small stuff they control practically all of the major computer lines
9241,they made their real breakthrough in micromonolithic circuit designs undercutting practically everyone else in the market
9242,ah see
9243,no vaughns too powerful hes got too many top people on his side you see doctor i darent make a move against him unless i have good reason to do so
9244,yes sir right here
9245,oh no no my units are on constant alert so should you find yourselves in any real trouble you can just give us a call
9246,now this is a small transceiver range of about fifty miles on a set frequency just press this button and ask for me
9247,no they must have gone out
9248,thank you you know doctor that chap mister vaughn doesnt seem such a bad man
9249,hey
9250,dont break it
9251,what
9252,what do you mean what have we here
9253,well whats that
9254,whats so odd about that
9255,oh doctor just put it back together again
9256,i dont suppose zoe would have left a note do you no i cant see anything well you might at least help me look for it
9257,eh
9258,oh ah tired of waiting gone to ie offices to look for you zoe and isobel
9259,i thought that we were going in there to look for zoe and isobel
9260,but how are we going to find out that they are in there
9261,youre right you know this does lead into the back of the place
9262,it will the doctor will be taken care of i shall see to that personally
9263,what
9264,probably empty
9265,that man must be a superman
9266,its amazing
9267,come on lets find zoe and isobel and get out of here these fellows are giving me the creeps
9268,this place is like a maze doctor i think were lost
9269,come on
9270,guards guards
9271,and hes beginning to try mine
9272,correction they were it would seem that youve been chasing each others tails they came here looking for you
9273,now listen you im telling i definitely saw those
9274,then you shall inspect them at your leisure after you
9275,ah just too late im afraid such a pity still all is not lost i am myself going down to the factory today would you care to join me we can meet the train on its arrival
9276,all in good time young man the train and the empty crate car will take some time to get here in the meantime id rather like to talk to you
9277,yes those circuits you gave me theyre rather fascinating i like to know more about them
9278,in all basic essentials yes it is thats the secret of my success you see uniformity duplication my whole empire is based on that principle the very essence of business efficiency do sit down
9279,i must say im rather glad we have this opportunity to talk
9280,i should of course be angry with you youve thwarted my elaborate security precautions twice id like to know why
9281,my dear young man i wasnt angry with her on the contrary i found the incident quite amusing shes a remarkable girl and you doctor are obviously a man of no mean scientific ability
9282,oh my research department found these quite fascinating theres a totally illogical factor in their construction are they of your own invention  ah youre determined to guard your secret i see i dont blame you and i promise not to pry any more in fact ill do all i can to help you
9283,now you say you came here looking for professor watkins because you thought he might be able to help you
9284,hey look youre not going to trust him are you i mean what about zoe and isobel
9285,theyre in that box im sure of it
9286,i dont think you could annoy that man even if you want to hes being as nice as pie
9287,aye but why should he be
9288,hey do you think he knows about the tardis then
9289,no well perhaps this professor watkins will be able to tell us whats going on around here
9290,what
9291,there you see
9292,what is it
9293,dont ask me youre the brains hey look a helicopter could it be the brigadiers lot
9294,yes of course i remember anne travers telling me about you she was a student of mine you know some years ago brilliant girl brilliant
9295,oh travers was getting past it a bit you know and anne persuaded him to go to america with her
9296,what are you doing here
9297,aye aye
9298,on the contrary what anne told me about the tardis was most intriguing id like to hear a lot more about it
9299,of course there is
9300,oh i see yes
9301,oh its very simple really ive been developing a new kind of teaching machine
9302,but what can we do if as you say they have isobel and your young friend then were entirely at their mercy
9303,do you think he can help us
9304,i know no more than you do hes a ruthless man without morals or principles his object im sure is to get complete control of the electronics industry of the world
9305,dont bother doctor allow me very ingenious a simple magnet i congratulate you
9306,you may still be adolescent enough to make idle threats young man but i can assure you i am not i want your travel machine doctor otherwise i shall hand your friend zoe over to packer its a simple choice and shouldnt take you longer than an hour to consider take them away packer
9307,now professor i suggest you continue with your work
9308,why
9309,keep your mouth shut and do as youre told
9310,be quiet
9311,you mean youre willing to talk
9312,eh
9313,what are you going to do
9314,what will that do
9315,but were six floors up
9316,no but then why do it he might be playing for time but i doubt it
9317,yes but what good has it done us i mean were stuck here in this lift now
9318,hey where does that lead to
9319,you know something youre a clever wee chappie
9320,dont panic packer our birds cant fly away
9321,hey doctor ive just been thinking what happens if they get the lift going before we get to the top
9322,what
9323,bring it up to the sixth floor
9324,well never make it
9325,whats happened
9326,only another floor doctor theyve started it again
9327,wait a minute doctor
9328,now where
9329,oh no
9330,hey doctor do you think that this is the train that zoe and isobel came on
9331,vaughn said that one had empty crates on it didnt he
9332,oh no these are full  packer
9333,doctor i think
9334,but doctor
9335,doctor
9336,that thing in there it moved in the crate theres something alive in there
9337,look it moved i tell you
9338,positive
9339,zoe and isobel
9340,could be the brigadiers lot call them up for help
9341,whats that
9342,how do we find out which room theyre in and when we have how do we get them out
9343,theres not much time
9344,simple
9345,doctor its them look
9346,youre not going to leave the lassies by themselves are you
9347,doctor hey doctor whats the matter
9348,yes the tardis went wrong you see and we had a sort of well what doctor a forced landing
9349,spaceships on the other side of the moon
9350,but these werent saucers all of the sightings were quite clear on that
9351,oh yes weve got several in the files shall i get them
9352,right
9353,mean anything to you doctor
9354,exactly thats why i brought it up
9355,aye it was wrapped up in that gauze stuff
9356,what do you think it was doctor
9357,how
9358,aye if you think im going back inside there
9359,thank you here we are now this this is the whole area in detail london offices warehouse area and surrounding buildings
9360,but doctor you cant go back the same way again theyll be waiting for us this time
9361,anything i can do to help
9362,are you sure this is how we get in
9363,eh
9364,where do they come from
9365,the cybermen
9366,what on earth are cybermen
9367,at vaughns headquarters in london
9368,so vaughns helping them
9369,aye they must have quite an army by now the thing is where are they hiding them all
9370,at the ministry of defence i better get on to him immediately and tell him what youve discovered
9371,yes the cybermen have means of controlling peoples minds they appear to be almost normal but theyre not theyre controlled
9372,right doctor it seems were too late the brigadiers already been in to see rutlidge
9373,proceed
9374,and thats where you think they might be
9375,yes but if theres water in the sewers wouldnt that affect them
9376,yes yes jimmy youre right of course what we really need is some sort of evidence some proof
9377,what
9378,aye here
9379,yes we have sir a computer and various radio and radar components
9380,ill show you doctor this way
9381,london now we shouldnt do anything without the doctor och
9382,found something
9383,but what does it do
9384,but why put it a circuit if it doesnt do anything
9385,they wont we shall be protected by the implanted audiorejection capsules you see packer ive thought all this out in detail nothing has been overlooked
9386,perhaps we can find a lab for you to work in
9387,right ill arrange transport
9388,ill arrange for a helicopter to transport the photographic detail here for a briefing over  man
9389,yes doctor
9390,they took a van and went back to london sir
9391,yes sir
9392,im sorry doctor but i think those crazy kids have gone off to the sewers to get photos of the cybermen
9393,sergeant
9394,dont worry doctor well get them back
9395,any success
9396,so were no further ahead
9397,miss watkins is developing her photographs im taking a full report to geneva and unit central command
9398,depends i leave in the morning if i can get the report to the council tomorrow we should get some action within two or three days
9399,the people im trying to convince are a little more sceptical
9400,what
9401,tea doctor
9402,you know we dropped five grenades right on top of them and one of them still came out of it id hate to have to fight a whole army of them
9403,oh do please do
9404,but you have no time gregory no time at all
9405,the doctor discovered something important come on
9406,the signals will activate these circuits
9407,but you still havent told us what that will do
9408,well isnt there anything we can do
9409,the depolariser worn at the back of the neck it will jam the cybercontrol waves
9410,well a few i think
9411,we are moving into position now ready to transmit the cybersignal
9412,only three im afraid we couldnt find any more neuristors
9413,whats that noise
9414,doctor the invasion its begun
9415,were fine
9416,yes sir  brigadier
9417,right sir over and out well sounds like total success for vaughn and the cybermen
9418,i doubt theres time for that jimmy what do you think doctor
9419,is there nothing we can do
9420,yes but if your theorys right theyll be coming from somewhere near the moon that means were going to need a missile of some sort
9421,its a possibility
9422,it means its all a question of time how long do you think we have doctor
9423,now doctor we must deal with this invasion you say is coming
9424,would we be able to pick them off with antimissile missiles
9425,right theres a base near henlow downs just a minute sergeant walters
9426,oh its just a slight flesh wound but hes furious because the army doctor wont let him walk on it
9427,oh hell be all right isobels with him anything i can do doctor
9428,right what are you going to do
9429,what go back but hed kill you as soon as look at you
9430,no this is madness i cant afford to let you take that risk
9431,but how can you find that out
9432,but youll never get near the place the whole area will be crawling with cybermen
9433,wheres that
9434,were coming in to land sir
9435,oh and sergeant make sure that a chopper stays in red sector one area the doctor might need it in a hurry
9436,doctor ive worked with the cybermen for five years preparing this invasion i know them the way they think the singlemindedness of their purpose
9437,of course but then they are my allies not my enemies
9438,oh ive planned this whole operation in great detail allowing for every possible factor it was i who contacted them in deep space provided the means by which they travelled to earth and masterminded the whole operation from a to z they have merely provided their advanced scientific skills their might and strength
9439,what they want and what theyre going to get are two entirely different things
9440,all cybermen here are conditioned to obey my orders they are directly under my command
9441,if theyre not ill destroy them
9442,yes
9443,ill have more made
9444,theyll be under my command exactly like the others
9445,now just try and clear your head theres a great deal to be done
9446,youre just playing for time arent you
9447,your unit friends you presumably managed to protect them from the cybercontrol as well what are they planning
9448,the invasion fleet will arrive in two parts
9449,we no longer need you a cybermegatron bomb will be delivered we must destroy life on earth completely every living being
9450,you cannot stop us no one can
9451,opposition is useless the cybermen will
9452,its dead i killed it i destroyed it
9453,five years and in less than five seconds
9454,what
9455,the radio
9456,vaughn theyve taken over the cybermen they wont obey theyve killed the theyre coming after us vaughn what have you done to us what have you done
9457,we cant fight them theyre too powerful too many of them
9458,at the compound but theyll be there
9459,well destroying the spaceship is going to take time now weve heard from captain turner the russians are with us but they say itll take at least ten hours or more to get a missile that far  doctor
9460,help you why should i
9461,and if i survive what future have i got what will the world do with me
9462,appealing to my better nature no if i help you itll be because i hate them the cybermen my allies you think im mad that all i want is power for its own sake no i have to have power the world is weak vulnerable a mess of uncoordinated and impossible ideals it needs a strong man a single mind a leader
9463,right ill help you to destroy them because i hate them they destroyed my dream  brigadier
9464,no no no ill take that the cybermen will be guarding the radio transmitter
9465,well dont take any chances well get there as soon as we can where should we head for
9466,what are you doing we must destroy them
9467,yes sir
9468,yes
9469,thats where the main control switch is for the radio beam
9470,well lets not waste time then
9471,you all right doctor
9472,just a second
9473,unit control calling captain turner unit control calling captain turner do you read me
9474,unit control calling captain turner unit control calling captain turner do you read me
9475,but in moving in fifty thousand miles theyve come into range of the russian missiles well it cant be more than a few miles from them
9476,thank you jimmy out thats more than time enough for them to deliver their bomb and move out to safety isnt it
9477,here
9478,are you sure this is the place doctor
9479,oh goodbye
9480,ive no idea
9481,search me
9482,because my son it is the law of the krotons
9483,you dont expect him to know do you
9484,an umbrella
9485,sulphur isnt it it could be poisonous
9486,whats that
9487,oh what
9488,is it a city
9489,inca perhaps
9490,yes and theres a door as well is it a wall
9491,phwoar that smells a lot stronger round here
9492,well er
9493,what
9494,but why
9495,machine doctor its opening
9496,whats the matter with him
9497,what happened to him
9498,oh i hope theyre friendly
9499,who are you
9500,answer me where are you from
9501,theyre not gonds their clothes the way theyre dressed
9502,is she being sacrificed
9503,can we not stop them
9504,oh you do do you aye well thats just fine with me then
9505,oh jamie watch out
9506,what is happening who are these people
9507,who are you
9508,were from another planet another world
9509,och look were just wasting time now where has she gone
9510,honour she didnt want to go nobody really wants to disappear into that thing
9511,why are you asking so many questions
9512,because its poisoned and you will die
9513,doctor that girl if she comes out that way
9514,i know
9515,thara youll die
9516,what are you going to do
9517,can i help
9518,thara
9519,what
9520,doctor i think i can hear something
9521,whats happened what have they done to her
9522,that could have happened to you
9523,aye its something that those krotons have done to her
9524,isnt there anything you can do
9525,my fathers house is quite near on the edge of the community
9526,just the same
9527,how is she
9528,is she going to be all right though
9529,and she was one of the finest students weve ever produced
9530,aye they never leave that machine
9531,yes in the hall of learning where you were today the machines fill the mind with knowledge
9532,when they are young yes that is the law
9533,our law the gonds
9534,yes all our science all our culture everything we have has come from the machine
9535,well why are they doing it doctor whats the point
9536,well what are you afraid of
9537,then its too late
9538,but the poison
9539,what are you doing
9540,the krotons will come out
9541,what is it
9542,oh doctor dont move
9543,oh i wouldnt be so sure
9544,pattern recognition
9545,doctor do you mean that thing was sent out to attack you and only you
9546,or at least what you look like
9547,its gone back
9548,eh
9549,where did this come from
9550,but i thought they didnt know anything about electricity
9551,yes there are tremendous gaps in their knowledge well they only seem to know what the machines teach them
9552,how is she doctor
9553,why
9554,oh do we
9555,what for
9556,theres nothing wrong with me
9557,oh now why cant i go with you
9558,well why are we going back to the learning hall
9559,im coming with you doctor
9560,i must know what is happening
9561,oh dont worry jamie ill make sure he doesnt do anything rash
9562,oh that leads to the underhall
9563,nothing its never used
9564,i told you there was nothing down there
9565,only the foundations of the machine it stands on those metal pillars
9566,oh youre soon back doctor
9567,i was just trying the machine
9568,oh but doctor it was all so easy the krotons were very pleased with me
9569,well i felt they were
9570,yes of course
9571,doctor
9572,look at the dial
9573,its amazing even the best of our students registered less than half that score
9574,its crystalline
9575,what was it like down there
9576,a root structure but indicates that
9577,well is that possible
9578,well if youre right that means that the whole of this machine is a sort of a living thing
9579,the krotons command it means there is a message for me
9580,class three one nine seven selected female zogond
9581,theyve chosen you as a companion
9582,oh doctor what shall i do
9583,im afraid she must complete obedience is the krotons first command and if we fail to obey
9584,oh dear
9585,oh but im not a gond
9586,where are you going
9587,oh sit down and put this headset on and press the button press the button
9588,oh doctor youve got it all wrong
9589,i see
9590,oh doctor youve divided instead of multiplying you must concentrate
9591,you answered more questions besides this isnt supposed to be a competition
9592,yes perhaps the krotons arent as bad as we think
9593,the krotons will be waiting for zoe
9594,yes but perhaps they were impressed with your performance and thats why
9595,class three one nine eight selected male doctorgond
9596,well it means you anyway
9597,i suppose we have to
9598,oh this is all my fault
9599,i am sorry doctor my people will always remember you
9600,it is a spaceship
9601,i think weve been asked to sit down
9602,what for
9603,doctor i cant move
9604,to find a way into this box of tricks
9605,yes i think so
9606,what happened
9607,they seem to have a way of transferring mental power to pure energy
9608,doctor look
9609,i thought there was a wall here
9610,whats that
9611,what
9612,but whats its purpose
9613,and what do you suppose these are they look like astronauts air lines
9614,oh doctor
9615,well what are we going to do if we do get out we havent learned anything yet
9616,it should slide somewhere
9617,doctor look theres a photoelectric cell here it cant be working
9618,then the krotons have cut the circuit
9619,then were trapped they know were here
9620,doctor
9621,will mica work
9622,they have activated the circuit  kroton 2
9623,the tardis but we cant leave jamie behind
9624,all waste matter must be dispersed that is procedure
9625,which we activated
9626,just like a giant mousetrap and those poor gond students have been the mice
9627,what are you doing
9628,yes jamie remarked about the smell as soon as we stepped out of the tardis
9629,what oh of course the worst smell in the world
9630,why didnt i think of that
9631,doctor what do you want sulphur for
9632,go on
9633,oh doctor can we go now
9634,well its one of the exceptional elements in the periodic table its atomic weight is a hundred and twenty eight
9635,and its atomic number is fifty
9636,it doesnt really matter anymore
9637,return
9638,stop        kroton 2
9639,cant it see
9640,look its moving again now
9641,its going towards the tardis
9642,oh doctor the tardis
9643,well now what shall we do
9644,look its all right again
9645,you knew it would vanish like that didnt you
9646,the what
9647,oh to move where
9648,doctor youre back
9649,selris said youd gone into the machine
9650,much
9651,holiday we arent
9652,the citys being evacuated
9653,my fathers going to lead an attack against the krotons he hopes theyll strike back and come out into the open
9654,demolish the machines supports
9655,i havent the doctor asked to see your laboratory
9656,whats that
9657,yes i think so but the krotons forbid us to study chemistry
9658,he followed you out to the learning hall
9659,you dont suppose he tried to get into the machine do you
9660,yes lets
9661,but the machine will come down first look at the vibration
9662,doctor
9663,doctor look out
9664,are all right doctor
9665,we must hurry theres going to be a
9666,ill strap it oh doctor give me the wood
9667,you think therell be another earthquake
9668,the noise was coming from the machine but its stopped
9669,no i havent hey can i borrow your braces
9670,oh all right
9671,yes doctor im afraid we have failed the machine is unharmed
9672,what has happened to it
9673,oh he sent this doctor
9674,poo sulphuric acid
9675,doctor what about jamie
9676,but he followed you
9677,but doctor jamie wouldnt be any use to them his mind is completely untrained
9678,doctor
9679,quick
9680,its just on my back
9681,i know
9682,its just another inch i think
9683,quick
9684,whats been happening i though that machine was going to shake itself to pieces
9685,well
9686,eh
9687,oh not again
9688,yes but
9689,but doctor
9690,what do we do next
9691,you can doctor
9692,well help you into it
9693,only the two high brains must enter
9694,i think wed better do as they say doctor
9695,doctor
9696,you will assist us now
9697,well thats your problem
9698,it transfers the dynatrope back to our own cosmos it operates through mental power
9699,no more questions
9700,unless you do as we order you will be dispersed
9701,ceased to function we carried out the emergency procedure and landed on the nearest planet to conserve power we set the dynatrope in perpetual stability
9702,aye maybe so but im not going down without a fight now where do we put this stuff
9703,you will suffer no harm
9704,take up your positions
9705,you have no choice put on the head set
9706,final phase on automatic
9707,unimportant
9708,oh oh doctor i wanted to stand there
9709,put on the head sets or you will be dispersed
9710,nothing seems to be happening
9711,enough of this put on the head sets
9712,whats happening
9713,yes doctor look its dissolving
9714,oh doctor these fumes theyre choking
9715,did you get on all right
9716,how are you
9717,well we reckoned if the doctor thought it worthwhile experimenting with a few drops wed see what a few gallons would do
9718,but how did you know the machine would dissolve
9719,but the machine wasnt pure tellurium
9720,doctor if weve landed where are we
9721,hey were just hanging in space
9722,well lets try and find a star we know
9723,hes trying to climb aboard
9724,aye
9725,what
9726,oh doctor what is it
9727,aye
9728,a what
9729,hey quite a place isnt it
9730,hey look at the size of this one doc
9731,oh doctor look
9732,travel mat it sounds like a flying carpet
9733,aye well we have our own system thank you only it isnt foolproof
9734,for the last time who are you and what are you doing in my private workshop
9735,how did you even get in here
9736,why did you come
9737,the museum is  what on earths that its a twentieth century police box isnt it
9738,oh well you could say it was a form of space ship
9739,i own it that is why i have the right to ask you to leave
9740,interested in professor eldred and his antiquated machines come for a good laugh i suppose like the rest of them
9741,now were not thieves you know
9742,yes magnificent it was to have been the vehicle to take man beyond the moon tmat put an end to all that
9743,exactly exactly here let me show it to you let me show it to you
9744,and the secret the real breakthrough was a compact generator of enormous power
9745,yes you see it beat the problem of the neutral caesium ions and incidentally it magnified the gthrust to fantastic proportions
9746,well ill show you come with me ill show you look
9747,because of tmat tmat the ultimate in travel with about as much sense of adventure as a synthetic carbohydrates factory
9748,nobody cares any more about exploring space life made well it was made too easy by tmat
9749,no more money no more facilities a lifes work abandoned just like that all because of tmat
9750,you still havent told me who you are and what youre doing here
9751,im sorry i dont think weve met my names radnor this is miss kelly
9752,with tmat dead there is no other way your rocket is our only hope of reaching the moon
9753,im listening
9754,wed probably overshoot by a few million years
9755,aye
9756,you
9757,but the rocket is not ready
9758,thats your answer
9759,yes im not sure about him doctor
9760,oh aye i can be useful too you know
9761,new york and moscow transit impossible due to tmat malfunction
9762,well all the equipment has been completely automated and solar powered designed all myself no reason why it shouldnt work
9763,are you sure you remember all that i told you at the briefing
9764,well just in case ive written it all down here
9765,and theres a map of moonbase too now you know how to operate the homing beam
9766,ahem
9767,and remember youve only got enough food and water for three days
9768,and yet youre perfectly prepared to allow them to risk theirs
9769,three minutes seems an awfully long time
9770,look zoe ill have you know that the doctor and i have  kelly
9771,what is it
9772,its no use no contact at all every circuits dead
9773,well theres no use worrying about the radio now were nearly at the end of the journey
9774,oh ah but if theyve all been cut off how can they activate
9775,what
9776,hello earth control this is moonbase emergency emergency can you hear me
9777,whats gone wrong i thought you said it was infallible
9778,you said wed have trouble if that didnt work
9779,weve only got enough food and water for three days remember
9780,a rocket but thats impossible
9781,well our orbit will bring us back into his range in approximately forty three seconds
9782,well his signal was quite strong when we were orbiting his side of the moon theres no reason for it to fade
9783,doctor these aliens he described
9784,what
9785,well what do they want
9786,why the moon
9787,yes
9788,we should just about be coming into range now
9789,doctor if we could adapt our homing equipment to his radio signal we could beam in on that
9790,yes here
9791,we need to fire the retrorockets in seventeen point five seconds
9792,aye and lets hope that radio beam thing doesnt conk out before we get there
9793,can you get us back into orbit
9794,its working again doctor can you lock back onto it
9795,aye well were down thats that main thing
9796,now what do we do
9797,yes but what are you going to do
9798,but what about the ice warriors
9799,but doctor you cant just go
9800,right ill come with you
9801,ah
9802,when the time comes you will do exactly what you are told or die
9803,who are you
9804,yes but whered you come from
9805,thank heavens you made it are the others here too
9806,these creatures you mean
9807,well there arent many but theyre deadly
9808,look theyve killed everybody here all except fewsham hes helping them
9809,control headquarters through this way
9810,you must be destroyed
9811,humans are our enemies
9812,who are you where are you from
9813,impossible we control tmat how did you get here
9814,then you are lying you have been concealed here all the time
9815,no earth relies entirely on tmat there is no defence against our plans
9816,then guard the humans if they try to escape kill them
9817,ive seen what they can do
9818,all i know is they want me to send something to earth by tmat i suppose thats whats in it
9819,i cant theyll kill us both
9820,i said i cant
9821,wait open it i said open it
9822,oh well ill get back to the others and tell them the good news
9823,no
9824,are you all right
9825,aye lucky for us zoe and phipps turned the heating up just in time
9826,they went though the maintenance tunnel to the main control room
9827,oh doctor  oh are you all right
9828,he attacked a warrior hes also got tmat working again
9829,all right fewsham therell be a full inquiry when we get back to earth tell them weve no more time to waste here we must tmat back to earth immediately
9830,look theres a way of doing that here this is a time switch it delays transportation by ten seconds
9831,now ill dispatch you and follow using the time switch
9832,in you get miss kelly look ill use the time switch youd better hurry or those ice warriors could be back any minute
9833,where have you been
9834,and what have you been up to all this time
9835,will somebody kindly tell me whats happening down here who are these people is tmat working again
9836,an ice warrior here
9837,well he said hed follow using the time switch
9838,i thought so the time switch is out of order
9839,well hes obviously working for them
9840,no our warriors will land here on the moon when the seed pods have done their work on earth it will be time to commence the second stage of our plan
9841,these incidents are so unrelated this fungus everywhere whats that got to do with it
9842,well its indestructible weve attacked it in every possible way but without success
9843,are you suggesting we should psychoanalyse it doctor
9844,well theres laboratory equipment in my workshop you could use that
9845,well no problem about that the gardens are full of the stuff
9846,er doctor do be careful those pod things are deadly
9847,well i dont know if it were given top priority
9848,as far as i can make out it is
9849,according to my calculations to one twentieth of normal
9850,look out doctor if that thing explodes in here the fumes will kill us come on doctor
9851,come on before its too late
9852,no hes in conference with miss kelly and sir james gregson
9853,well what is it
9854,oh but doctor surely ordinary
9855,well cant you reach them on the videophone
9856,what do you want me to do
9857,all right doctor ill tell him
9858,yes
9859,i dont know its yes moon control
9860,well yes
9861,countdown about to commence minus three minutes
9862,why what do you mean
9863,what
9864,message understood
9865,water well all we need to do then is to make it rain
9866,youve only just told me
9867,an hour ago we were in conference
9868,doctor the weather control bureau was the last place the warrior was sighted
9869,get me security
9870,hey
9871,it still is doctor theres an ice warrior in the building
9872,well he drew the warrior off so that i could let you in
9873,oh no doctor this way
9874,doctor
9875,well i locked him in the room that we were trapped in
9876,wed just be trapped again
9877,why
9878,oh doctor hurry
9879,what do you mean
9880,is that the one
9881,oh hurry doctor
9882,oh
9883,hes trying to blast his way in
9884,well what do we do now
9885,solar energy when we were on the moon phipps made a trap
9886,aye well youd better be quick about it that shield thing wont hold much longer
9887,well sort of its not quite the same his was bigger
9888,are you nearly ready doctor
9889,are you sure that thing works now
9890,must be chasing after those guards
9891,eh
9892,what this
9893,right
9894,its hopeless doctor youll never get that thing going again
9895,eh aye
9896,be careful with this
9897,i shall return to our ship to finalise invasion plans
9898,its not raining yet
9899,are you sure youre getting it right doctor
9900,what else is there
9901,we finished and installed the homing device its working perfectly
9902,doctor
9903,i know were sending up a false signal but arent some of the martian ships bound to follow the right one
9904,what about slaars signal
9905,but how
9906,theyll kill you on sight
9907,whats it for
9908,well there it is its in orbit were now picking up the aliens homing signal from the moon
9909,oh well be ready
9910,oh doctor
9911,you will be careful wont you
9912,but doctor our control of tmat hasnt been tested
9913,you over there i ordered you to be destroyed
9914,what is your purpose in coming here
9915,the directional beam is still operative
9916,are you capable of operating the tmat mechanism
9917,as long as you can be useful to us you can live but this time there will be no escape you will familiarise yourself with the tmat controls
9918,when our warriors arrive you will transmit them to earth under my direction
9919,nothing can go wrong now
9920,the signal there is no power you did this
9921,but they were receiving my signal
9922,you sent a signal from earth
9923,the heat of the sun will kill them you have destroyed our entire fleet
9924,earth will still die the fungus will take the oxygen from your atmosphere
9925,doctor
9926,creag an tuire
9927,so you really did know what you were doing at the weather control bureau
9928,did you have to make it rain as hard as all that
9929,what did you rush us back here for
9930,oh its no good asking him hes no more idea than the man in the moon
9931,whats wrong
9932,interesting a piece of old machinery
9933,it looks like some sort of control room
9934,no zoe i meant in the tardis
9935,well how do you know that
9936,yes but what does it do
9937,whats that
9938,now what are we going to do the tardis is in there
9939,what
9940,yes i think so
9941,no
9942,whats that look
9943,doctor theres no way out of here
9944,oh doctor what can we do
9945,i think theyre trying to burn through it
9946,aye they mustve known we were trapped why not finish us off
9947,whats the matter
9948,whats that
9949,what are they doing
9950,aye while weve still got the chance
9951,i havent heard anybody for ages come on
9952,well its not hot any more
9953,let me do it zoe youll have to eat more porridge
9954,what
9955,i wont tangle with you general you come on in and join the party oh and mind you dont scratch your nice shiny white paint
9956,can you see anything doctor
9957,well whats on the other side could you see
9958,are you sure
9959,doctor does that mean the tardis is gone
9960,i dont understand why would anybody want to blow up a space machine
9961,but what about those men that tried to killed us
9962,now were just floating aimlessly on a bit of debris
9963,hey
9964,because of the rockets oh i see so whoever broke up the machine is sending all the pieces to the same place
9965,oh so we can get back to the tardis then if its only a mile away
9966,have you got an idea doctor
9967,yes but remember hes no fool if he suspects hes being followed youll be in trouble meanwhile im going in to land on ta relay reports to the nearest beacon
9968,oh whats the use well never get out of this
9969,what are they
9970,hey
9971,how do you know
9972,you mean the machine was built in separate sections and assembled in space by magnetism
9973,oh so the explosion was just strong enough to break the magnetic attraction between each section
9974,but that doesnt do us any good does it
9975,you mean draw it towards us
9976,hey well do you think you could do it
9977,oh
9978,yes theres just one thing doctor
9979,how do you know the next section to this one is an opposite pole
9980,well if its similar your idea wont work will it well just shoot off in the opposite direction
9981,i think so
9982,how much longer
9983,i hope it works
9984,aye maybe that wiring looks like a cats cradle to me
9985,yes ready doctor
9986,oh doctor youve got it wrong were gathering speed
9987,what
9988,oh doctor for goodness sake do something
9989,doctor
9990,then were worse off now just floating hopelessly in space
9991,report back when the arrest is made
9992,oh doctor what about you
9993,whats that
9994,weve been discovered
9995,oh no you dont
9996,now come on now if you dont answer my questions im going to have to start getting tough with you
9997,oh no a boy a girl and a nut case you cant be the pirates
9998,oh doctor hes coming round
9999,yes i think he is coming round girl i only give him a quarter blast hey listen you there listen she calls you doctor doctor she called you now why did she say that
10000,are you all right jamie
10001,its very rude to point you know especially with a gun
10002,how did you get here
10003,oh you mean you got some sort of ship you docked on the beacon
10004,anythings possible in the tardis especially when hes at the controls
10005,nine ten now come on the truth i want the whole truth
10006,someones firing at us come on lets get out of here
10007,ten seconds the nerve of that greenhorn saying things like that to me  warne
10008,have you ever heard of argonite doctor
10009,argonite is used for well its used for practically everything its ductile its tensile its heatproof its practically indestructible
10010,ah you mean to say that you have honestly never heard of argonite its the most expensive mineral in the galaxy
10011,well if that doesnt beat jumping grasshoppers you mean to say you travel around in time as well as space
10012,aye it would be if we knew where we were going to land up every time
10013,if we ever see the tardis again
10014,i cant do that its all in bits isnt it
10015,no no no only the argonite pirates know that theyre toting them off for salvage
10016,the pot was broken
10017,well theres a metal pot in that cupboard there made of tillium
10018,report back as soon as the minnow fleet is clear i am not giving milo clancey any more chances
10019,i think im going to be sick
10020,ill have another cup if theres some there zoe there you are thats as good as new
10021,hello
10022,yeah it is a bittie thats your thermonuclear power you see yeah its wearing out a bit nothing you can do about that
10023,thats the planet called ta
10024,well you see madeleine issigri who runs that show now shes a sworn enemy of mine well so ive been told anyway general hermack will think ill go anywhere else rather than go there
10025,no no theres no surface life on ta girl theres too much ultraviolet radiation dont you worry dont you worry well be all right well be a mile underground as long as i can fall into my old landing pad
10026,gruyere cheese
10027,safe is that what you call this
10028,well were a mile underground here this is the old freighter dock and theres nothing to see theres nowhere to go its just a whole maze of argonite tunnels and if you go in there well even i maynt be able to find you again you stay right here in this ship
10029,doctor do you believe him
10030,well he never did explain how he turned up the way he did did he and that space corp ship was chasing him
10031,well i dont see weve got much of a chance anyway look its up there in space somewhere on a bit of that beacon heading for i dont know where
10032,theres no need to guess doctor its easy enough to work out
10033,applied mathematics
10034,oh well if you dont want to know what ive discovered
10035,this was the position of our bit of beacon when milo first saw us i got the figures from the computer
10036,and this was our position eight minutes later when he docked along side
10037,well from this data it was simple enough to work out our original position and course do you see
10038,yes but i allowed for that look
10039,electromagnetic waves are always at rightangles to the direction of propagation and as you know travel at one hundred and eighty six thousand two hundred and eighty two miles per second
10040,here
10041,if wed stayed on our original course the tardis would have landed within ten miles of where we are now except of course it would still be up there because we werent travelling quite so fast
10042,did all that talk mean that the tardis is going to land somewhere around here
10043,aye well in that case the pirates are going to be round here too
10044,do you think milos one of them and thats why he landed here
10045,aye
10046,what do you think doctor should we go on or turn back
10047,well if they do well never get ourselves out
10048,what
10049,wheres it coming from
10050,hey doctor theres a wee light there look
10051,youre right it is a light
10052,im the lightest if you can lift me up perhaps i could see through
10053,what oh
10054,hurry up
10055,no theyre cutting up bits of scrap and it looks like part of the beacon
10056,doctor weve got to try and stop them before they start cutting it up
10057,keep moving
10058,quick down this passage
10059,oh doctor are you all right
10060,whats the matter
10061,what are you carrying drawing pins for
10062,it looks like some sort of a prison cell
10063,oh doctor theres something over there
10064,what is it
10065,yes hes injured look
10066,then how did you get off the beacon
10067,do you think i havent tried that shaft is the only way in its impossible to get out
10068,ive searched every inch of this cell solid rock
10069,theres no door believe me youre only wasting your time
10070,aye a burial pit
10071,oh look doctor this is doing no good at all
10072,youll not find anything weve been over it three times already
10073,aye i know cracks in the wall
10074,there are marks like that all over the place
10075,oh search me
10076,what sort of control unit
10077,whats under there
10078,oh now wait a minute whats an audio lock
10079,what are you going to do with a tuning fork
10080,whats that noise its getting on everybodys nerves
10081,oh thats not going to get us out
10082,oh look i cant stand any more
10083,oh come on we can get away now
10084,whats the matter with you boy you dont think im in cahoots with the pirates do you
10085,i know theyve got nothing to do with me
10086,if that dont beat jumping grasshoppers you listen to me you three sourpusses youre only in this pickle now because you did the very thing i told you not to do you went wandering off into these mine workings ive had a whale of a time trying to find you and if you want to get out of here alive milo clancey is the only person who can show you the way now you either come with me or am i going to leave you here to rot
10087,oh theres no love lost between me and the space corp sonny jim but well youd better come with us i guess
10088,tarnation take it a couple of years ago id have nailed him before he got ten yards
10089,i told you thats the alarm signal now come on lets get out of here quick
10090,well just for a minute then remember theyre closing in on us all the time we stay here
10091,yeah well i thought she was i thought it was her lot that was behind all this piracy trying to do me out of business
10092,no no when i followed you down that shaft i recognised the leader of these pirates hes a murderous criminal called maurice caven
10093,no weve got you this far were not going to leave you here
10094,aye well they wont get much further dont worry
10095,oh doctor cant you think of something
10096,its an old power distributor box i think we got one on every level
10097,yes its connected
10098,yes all right but hurry doctor
10099,whats this contraption supposed to do doctor trip them up
10100,what
10101,is that all
10102,doctor theyre right behind me
10103,what
10104,there you go asking questions because youre harbouring a nest of vipers down there in those mine workings and theyre on their way up here at this very moment
10105,i dont want them killed there must be some other solution
10106,dyce
10107,come on hurry up out of the line move yourselves
10108,shut up
10109,land sakes alive its dom himself
10110,yeah well wait a moment now this yeah this is the old fellows private study land sakes its years since ive been in here
10111,are these candles
10112,how do they work
10113,hey we need a flint box
10114,nobody has look at the dust everywhere look
10115,well why do you say that doctor
10116,well what about it
10117,well why would anyone come down here just to wind a clock
10118,oh oh doctor
10119,of course its dom issigri i was closer to that man than a brother for fifteen years its dom all right what in the world have they done to him
10120,what
10121,what in the world has happened to him
10122,not her own father
10123,ah well yeah yeah yeah all right ill do that hey listen what am i going to talk to him about
10124,friends so hes caught you too hes caught us all of us
10125,youll never get out of here never youll all die here i tell you
10126,i know but why keep him prisoner all this time i mean surely it would be easier for them to have killed him and be done with it
10127,you mean mister issigri is still of some value to caven in some way
10128,escape that doors the only way out of here
10129,he hacked it out of the living rock that doors the only way out
10130,leads out to the passage outside and that steel is three inches thick i tell you its hopeless i spent my first year down here working on that hinge you can see its hardly marked
10131,its not an audio lock is it
10132,ah thats a relief
10133,yeah
10134,well yeah if you want to get me out of this room
10135,what ah well thats what i was going to say you see apart from these guards there if we can get past those guards well they wouldnt track us down in those tunnels i know those tunnels like the back of my hand
10136,what for
10137,good let me know as soon as youre ready
10138,are you sure itll work
10139,this one
10140,an old shirt and an old aeronautical journal
10141,yeah
10142,come on dom come on doctor come on dom in you go
10143,dont you worry about them theyre probably just checking up we havent been followed
10144,just getting ready for takeoff
10145,you understand dervish boost that crate into orbit immediately
10146,the doctor will be burned to a frazzle in the blast
10147,take deep breathes and again come on
10148,thank goodness for that for a moment i thought youd had it
10149,what happened why did milo take off without us
10150,oh but he must have how could the liz take off otherwise
10151,but surely of course remote control
10152,what good would it do caven shooting you off into space in a rocket
10153,oh now steady doctor
10154,quickly we must do something theyve cut off the air in the liz and my fathers in there hes dying this is the remote control unit
10155,right sir
10156,are you sure the radio links working
10157,what about the video
10158,how can we tell whether theyre all right or not
10159,hey doctor
10160,its dervish hes gone
10161,get control of the liz that would be something
10162,thats it i dont think hes bluffing and if he sets off an explosion in the atomic fuel store
10163,no vships require a complicated landing technique theyre so large
10164,then whos going to get us out of here
10165,but the liz is still jammed on remote control
10166,you hope
10167,youve got about six minutes
10168,hey thats a point where is it
10169,oh no problem hey well how are we going to get to it

10197,the court martial is now in session
10198,this whole area is under martial law
10199,you will have an opportunity of addressing the court at the proper time
10200,now the statements of lieutenant carstairs and lady jennifer have been taken into evidence the prisoners waylaid an ambulance in no mans land
10201,oh but none of thats true youve twisted the whole thing
10202,in the case of yourself and the girl the charge is one of espionage the penalty for all these charges is death
10203,we shall now hear the case for the defence have you anything to say
10204,certainly we wish to give you every opportunity to explain yourselves
10205,theres no need for that its in the statement next question
10206,has the defence finished with this witness
10207,i thought you were going to explain everything
10208,why has that general got it in for us he seems determined to find us guilty
10209,the court finds you guilty of espionage for a crime of this magnitude there is only one penalty
10210,the witnesses have given their evidence the court has reached its verdict if youve nothing further to say sentence will be passed
10211,oh i dont want to leave you doctor

10252,what on earth are you doing
10253,theres nothing there only wall
10254,well i still cant see anything

10258,i just cant let you go just like that
10259,i think hes right
10260,yes ill meet you by the front entrance
10261,are we going back to the tardis now
10262,i want a word with her
10263,maps artillery barrage and were still seven miles from the german line
10264,well our chaps wouldnt fire at us
10265,lets get out of here bring the rest of the maps
10266,right
10267,the mist the gas
10268,i cant go on theres something stopping me
10269,i cant
10270,that mist doctor what was it
10271,yes and the guns have stopped too
10272,oh come on
10273,oh no were not back here again
10274,yes thats the one
10275,doctor who were those people who attacked us just now
10276,oh but thats impossible
10277,time but no one can alter time
10278,but surely doctor
10279,i see so we went off the edge of this map and into a different time zone
10280,well how are we going to get back there
10281,bandages doctor
10282,find anything
10283,the only way to get inside that is to blow it up
10284,you serious
10285,right ill see what i can find
10286,oh come on doctor we havent got all night someones bound to turn up
10287,its a mills bomb its all i could find i thought we might hang it on the front of the safe and let it off
10288,look out
10289,blow us all up
10290,for goodness sake be careful thats amatol in there
10291,about four seconds
10292,well you remember there was this spy flap earlier today something about them getting away in an ambulance and one of them was a woman i dont think weve met before have we
10293,we quite understand    crane
10294,now dont do anything foolish old boy doc have you got any more bandages
10295,come on
10296,but theres a blank space in the middle theres nothing marked at all
10297,sie mũssen mit uns kommen
10298,aye
10299,that is not a name i want your full name
10300,good now we are getting somewhere what are you doing behind our lines
10301,so you are lost and very conveniently you find your way through our lines
10302,i find it both strange and suspicious
10303,three people dressed in civilian clothes trying to infiltrate through our lines admit it you are spies
10304,then tell me where you came from before you were picked up by that ambulance
10305,everything seems to be difficult for you to explain i advise you to tell me the truth now
10306,other planets a time machine the girl is from the future and the boy is from the past
10307,i think you must be mad
10308,young woman where did you meet this man
10309,you were fighting the redcoats in seventeen forty five that ambulance was it going to a hospital or to a lunatic asylum
10310,phantastisch
10311,what are you doing here where do you come from
10312,time travellers
10313,jawohl herr kapitän von weich
10314,von weich 1917 german front line to central control we have captured three people who escaped from the british sector they claim to be time travellers
10315,let the doctor show you again eh
10316,yes and then you put it back again
10317,is it possible
10318,can i have a look at that map doctor
10319,where do you think we are doctor
10320,oh doctor be careful
10321,you mean were mixed up in another war now
10322,get that tree moved
10323,lady jennifer drive on
10324,afraid weve run out of petrol
10325,oh well now what do we do
10326,its all right thisll do for the night eh
10327,we shouldnt have left him you know
10328,well now what do we do weve lost lieutenant carstairs the ambulance has broken down and were miles from the tardis
10329,are we still heading for that blank space in that map of yours
10330,so many of them that thing must be bigger inside than outside just like the tardis
10331,doctor look it is like the tardis bigger inside than out
10332,but who else would have space time machines like the tardis
10333,doctor what are these
10334,why are they just standing there like that
10335,romans like the ones that attacked us but these soldiers what are they here for
10336,were landing
10337,we could get away
10338,well then what are we going to do
10339,oh but doctor surely
10340,they will make excellent specimens for your reprocessing experiment
10341,oh doctor how do we get back to jennifer and jamie its working on remote control
10342,these glasses theyre both wearing them
10343,weve passed a reception area living quarters lecture rooms its just like a university
10344,why didnt they take any notice of us because of the glasses
10345,you two in
10346,in here youre late
10347,the lectures already started
10348,should you arrive on another planet you may not be aware that the problem is to retain the specimens personality as a fighting man while at the same time putting him under our control as you know we remove the human specimens from their own world and time and place them in a context which seems to them to be the same it is vital that they continue to believe that they are living their own lives on the planet earth and fighting the wars from which they were taken  zoe sotto
10349,oh cant we help him
10350,ill examine him later
10351,will you kindly return to your place
10352,the experiment was successful
10353,the aberration is only temporary he was probably involved with tracking down some german spies before he came here it has obviously become a fixation
10354,will you leave this apparatus alone
10355,you are here in the capacity of a student
10356,there was no need his processing had completely lapsed you saw that for yourself
10357,of course we can it is simply a case of reprogramming these circuits here
10358,and here
10359,and here
10360,you see its perfectly simple with the circuits arranged in this manner the machine removes all traces any previous processing
10361,and since we have now exceeded the time allotted for this demonstration i suggest you all continue to your next assignment
10362,but i think weve found the cause one of the students has been extremely helpful to me that one over there
10363,im going to show you some photographs you will identify anyone know to you particularly this doctor         scientist
10364,but you theres a security alarm out for you
10365,the war chief he pointed you out
10366,then why did you run
10367,yes i sent her to the security section for questioning
10368,im just about to reprocess him
10369,if i knew the precise timing of the plan that would be easier to answer
10370,yes of course just as you do but only the war chief knows the timing now really i am very busy
10371,oh very well
10372,i am about to deprocess him just as you suggested at my lecture
10373,yes hell remember everything would you strap him down please as soon as the deprocessing is completed everything will return to normal
10374,you he recognises you youre one of
10375,doctor where are we
10376,well i remember you and lady jennifer and i was captured wasnt i
10377,oh i see
10378,she can wait
10379,oh my head what happened
10380,they questioned me someone came in put on that strange headset and questioned me
10381,i saw pictures of people
10382,he was talking about the resistance at first he seemed to think i was one of them
10383,yes of course i can
10384,but how do we get back
10385,what was all that about
10386,how long have we got to wait here doctor
10387,the alarm signal theyve probably found that guard
10388,its an ambush
10389,oh doctor what about jamie have they killed him
10390,lets go this way
10391,why do you want to go to the processing room
10392,these resistance people before you reprocess them study them carefully if you find anything unusual send the prisoner concerned to me for questioning
10393,why
10394,ive no idea but i think wed better follow come on
10395,yes but why are you so interested in it doctor
10396,oh yes
10397,doctor why dont you use your sonic screwdriver as a power source
10398,theres just one thing though
10399,all these panels are interlinked
10400,well if you take one away whats to stop all the rest down like a pack of cards
10401,nothings happened
10402,its jamie hes alive
10403,but how they shot him down
10404,he was right take this prisoner to the security chief for questioning
10405,wed better get him out of there then
10406,oh doctor were too late where have they taken him
10407,right sir
10408,what happened where am i
10409,who are you
10410,doctor you must be the one that jamie was talking about where is he
10411,come on doctor we must get out of here
10412,come on doctor
10413,come on doctor
10414,what is this place
10415,just the people i want to get my hands on
10416,i dont care how many of them there are
10417,oh so what do we do now
10418,if you can find them theyre spread all over the place ive been trying to link them up myself but its finding them and you dont know who you can trust
10419,yes i memorised the files when i was in the security room
10420,those guardsll be all over the place
10421,ah
10422,oh
10423,wheres zoe whats happened
10424,zoe
10425,are you sure you can work these controls doctor
10426,there are more guards
10427,doctor how did you do it so easily
10428,after you doctor
10429,you mean youre staying here
10430,you can count on me then doctor
10431,what are you going to do about those guards doctor
10432,wherever they are i shall find them
10433,what are those doctor
10434,did we get away all right
10435,well can they get in the doors
10436,will we still get away all right
10437,what are you going to do doctor
10438,activate the dimensional control
10439,and the ceiling too
10440,what are we going to do doctor
10441,bring out the others
10442,bring out the others
10443,you are in no position to make terms
10444,for the last time tell your friends to come out or would you sooner they were crushed to death
10445,well where are we going doctor
10446,are we not going back to zoe and the tardis
10447,what are we going to do then doctor
10448,its taking its time isnt it
10449,youve no idea which zone were going to land in doctor
10450,oh just like the tardis eh
10451,eh
10452,are you sure this is the right way sir
10453,isnt this where we were attacked by the romans
10454,thats enough thats enough from both of you now i am tired of this eternal bickering your inability to work together is endangering our whole plan you have a choice cooperate or be replaced
10455,perfectly why
10456,oh where do we go from now doctor
10457,no dont shoot youll hit my friends well follow them
10458,in your case that wont be necessary you have already been condemned to death
10459,they will be given the chance to redeem themselves in the most dangerous sector of the front line
10460,sir
10461,i dont need any authority
10462,youve caused me a great deal of trouble and embarrassment now im afraid youre going to pay for it with your life
10463,doctor i thought theyd shot you
10464,hes in there
10465,quick doctor in here look i think he was trying to destroy it
10466,simple but just as foolish as using the security guards a violent attack on the chateau would almost certainly destroy the control units there the time zone barriers would disappear no use the conventional forces could be quite amusing a mass attack on the chateau a pincer movement with our little band of heroes caught in its jaws
10467,doctor
10468,theres troops moving in from all sides
10469,yeah
10470,well not long doctor our forward positions about to fall back already
10471,yeah
10472,what for
10473,well what can i do
10474,right
10475,doctor you and zoe must try and get away from here
10476,but doctor
10477,doctor now what
10478,some sort of trick
10479,aye a mist
10480,so none of the processed people will be able to get at us
10481,what next step doctor
10482,no doctor i pulled him through the window
10483,the security chief is right you have failed and your leadership of the security forces has hardly been spectacularly successful i will take charge of the whole situation now listen carefully this is what i plan to do
10484,qui étesvous questce qui se passe
10485,i think it has worked doctor at least he can see were not germans
10486,nous combattons le er sorry my french isnt up to it
10487,so you bring people back to normal with that thing
10488,yes but if youre going to do them all one by one itll take until doomsday
10489,dont shoot you might hit the doctor
10490,you and i are going to talk alone
10491,you may have changed your appearance but i know who you are
10492,your machine is a tardis youre too familiar with its controls to be a stranger
10493,stealing a tardis oh im not criticising you we are two of a kind
10494,we were both time lords and we both decided to leave our race
10495,just as i had
10496,how much have you learnt of our plans
10497,but do you realise our ultimate objectives
10498,the war games on this planet are simply the means to an end the aliens intend to conquer the entire galaxy a thousand inhabited worlds
10499,they are the most suitable recruits for our armies man is the most vicious species of all
10500,we have soldiers from most of the major wars in the planet earth the first world war the war between russia and japan of 1905 thirty years war
10501,how else can we find the most disciplined and courageous fighters
10502,we are going to bring a new order to the galaxy one united galactic empire
10503,did the time lords send you
10504,i have decided  i hold you responsible for the success of the plan failure will mean death to both of you
10505,but you will you have no alternative
10506,i shall lead the way
10507,doctor
10508,oh doctor
10509,are you all right
10510,dont worry doctor the war lord will welcome your loyalty and assistance
10511,we need each other
10512,shall we join the war lord it doesnt do to keep him waiting
10513,simply a variation on the old models
10514,there have been many advances made in space time technology
10515,its not a thing one can explain in a few words well discuss it later now we really should join the war lord
10516,very well yes youre right
10517,exactly when we are in control the machines i have brought with me will have expired if we hold the only space time travel machine we can rule our galaxy without fear of opposition
10518,he seems to have done very well we have the leaders of the resistance and the immediate threat to the war games is over but your sudden decision to join us worries me
10519,previously you thought the resistance to be the winning side what made you change your mind
10520,you have a silver tongue just like your friend the war chief what contribution can you make to our plan
10521,our scientist is at this moment producing new machines on the home planet
10522,very well you shall have the opportunity to prove your ability you will adjust the machines and reprocess your resistance friends
10523,i dont think they like you unfortunately i cannot spare any of my guards to protect you so you will have to fend for yourself
10524,leave him to me i kill him first
10525,the feeling is mutual    security chief
10526,yes we listened to him once before and look where it got us he led us into a trap
10527,have you got any explanation for your conduct
10528,im sorry doctor there seems to have been some kind of misunderstanding
10529,are you sure this new process will be completely effective
10530,eh oh
10531,eh
10532,ah james robert mccrimmon
10533,yes of course youre the chieftain whos that
10534,oh aye ill obey you
10535,excellent continue with the others if you can successfully process characters like these you will have made an immense contribution
10536,look do as youre told
10537,i had all discussion that took place between you and the doctor recorded what a stupid fool you are guards take him to the security bay collect his accomplice the doctor on the way if they offer any resistance shoot them both
10538,eh are you crazy you machine is no good villar is too strong for you
10539,you fix the machine so she dont work
10540,but doctor why did you get us here at all
10541,ah but weve been drawing them out to the time zones
10542,doctor somebodys coming three of them are heading this way
10543,it seems my trust in you was a little misplaced
10544,youd better because im
10545,but the personnel in the landing bay are not aware of my arrest when the security guards return from the time zones you wont stand a chance i can stop the arrival of the time machines
10546,hey wait a minute first we get our guns no
10547,its all right it was a personal debt i had to settle
10548,theres one thing i dont understand doctor how are you going to get all these people back to their own time
10549,you realise that we have very little time now the alarm has been sounded
10550,we could just go to the landing bay order a machine and leave
10551,sent back how
10552,im afraid that will not be possible there are only two machines left with enough life in them
10553,doctor does that mean that you cant do as you promised and get us all home
10554,you cant
10555,you cant unless doctor you mustnt call them in or it will be the end of us theyll show no mercy
10556,what did he mean doctor who mustnt you call
10557,who are they
10558,but it isnt all right is it doctor
10559,doctor are you all right
10560,doctor whats that
10561,i know i can see that
10562,the time lords
10563,well why havent you asked them for help before
10564,what
10565,what
10566,well what are we going to do doctor
10567,doctor doctor that came from the landing bay
10568,i kill him too
10569,when will they be here doctor
10570,but what are you going to do
10571,what are you talking about
10572,but why cant we stay with you
10573,but i thought they were your people your friends
10574,aye
10575,doctor can i come back there with you id rather like to try and find lady jennifer
10576,yes what about us
10577,yes its only fair doctor if these time lords are friends of yours why dont you wait for them to arrive
10578,you stay here with us my friend
10579,ah but doctor look hes not joking you know
10580,you move and i kill you
10581,theyre coming
10582,eh

10586,well what was happening why was it so difficult to move
10587,but theyre your own people arent they doctor
10588,why did you run away from them in the first place
10589,what do you mean you were bored
10590,well whats so wrong in all that
10591,and that wasnt enough for you
10592,well why do they object to you doing all that
10593,but youve helped people doctor
10594,well then what are you going to do
10595,we cant be landing already
10596,look out
10597,im not so sure
10598,doctor

10603,doctor cant you induce a power drive
10604,no i dont think so    time lord
10605,cant we get away again
10606,now just a moment whats going on around here
10607,let them stand aside until they are needed continue with the trial   bernard horsfall again  time lord 3
10608,why
10609,well look cant we get away
10610,you must speak in your defence  time lord 2
10611,yes it is and members of your own race agreed with me my war chief was himself was a time lord and the knowledge he brought me made the whole scheme possible and another of your time lords gave me his support
10612,we find you guilty of all charges against you your attempt to incriminate others is an obvious fraud
10613,and no power any longer to pass any sentence take these people
10614,let them go we shall not endanger innocent lives
10615,yes you shall make us many of these machines now get to the control panel and take us back to the home planet
10616,you will do as i say or we shall kill the girl
10617,galactic sector nine seven three then we will get the homing signal now operate the machine
10618,oh switch this thing off
10619,you have heard the charge against you that you have repeatedly broken our most important law of noninterference in the affairs of other planets what have you to say do you admit these actions
10620,do you admit that these actions were justified
10621,is that all you have to say
10622,aye
10623,we cant say goodbye through a forcefield  time lord 2
10624,what are they going to do to you
10625,well i think its time you left them again
10626,oh come on weve been in tighter situations than this
10627,of course hes not are you doctor eh
10628,hey theyve forgotten to switch that thing back on again
10629,well thats all we need isnt it now we can get away
10630,there must be something we can do
10631,but doctor surely we could
10632,i wont forget you you know
10633,oh youre a fine one to talk
10634,goodbye doctor will we ever meet again
10635,all right im coming
10636,of course
10637,they will both continue their lives as if nothing had happened
10638,we have accepted your plea that there is evil in the universe that must be fought and that you still have a part to play in that battle
10639,not entirely we have noted your particular interest in the planet earth the frequency of your visits must have given you special knowledge of that world and its problems
10640,for that reason you will be sent back to that planet
10641,in exile
10642,you will be sent to earth in the twentieth century and will remain there for as long as we deem proper and for that period the secret of the tardis will be taken from you
10643,your appearance has changed before it will change again that is part of the sentence
10644,you will have an opportunity to choose your appearance
10645,here is your first choice
10646,youre wasting time doctor
10647,since you refuse to take the decision the decision will be taken for you
10648,the time has come for you to change your appearance doctor and begin your exile
10649,oh no you cant get up come on
10650,what© no i thought i might do but hes a complete stranger ive never seen him before in my life
10651,im positive weve never met before
10652,yeah well dont ask go on push off
10653,why© you dont need them youre not going anywhere
10654,i know im almost finished
10655,yes
10656,yes
10657,i do but it wont work
10658,not so fast i have a lot of questions to ask you
10659,all right all right if i accept that you are the doctor there are still a lot of things oh by the way this is miss shaw
10660,from what we can gather you arrived last night in the middle of a shower of meteorites
10661,well objects from space at any rate you must realise that i cant let you go until im sure theres no connection
10662,those are bits of what the brigadier thought might be a meteorite
10663,its not thermoplastic and neither is it thermosetting and there are no polymer chains
10664,possibly
10665,no liz just liz
10666,about fifty as near as we can estimate
10667,one yes but there was an accident it disappeared
10668,well thats it i cant think of anything else we can try
10669,i cant understand it weve tried a dozen different methods of analysis and havent identified a single element
10670,primitive© weve got lasers spectrographs micron probes
10671,yes yes im sure you have
10672,well it is only a police box
10673,oh i see
10674,well i suppose it is your property
10675,the key
10676,it didnt turn when the brigadier tried to open it
10677,hes going
10678,doctor you tricked me
10679,it wont© give me the key doctor
10680,theres a great deal that i dont understand but one thing i did understand doctor was that you promised your help
10681,yes his names channing now he seemed to have some sort of mental hold over george almost as if he was hypnotised
10682,right ill lay on an ambulance
10683,that creature robot or whatever it was obviously came from there mister ransome described something very like it
10684,he must have cut his way out
10685,so they took him from under our very noses
10686,im afraid so it must have been praying on his mind
10687,er plastic dolls of course but our new line is display mannequins for shops we send them all over the country
10688,i cant think of another explanation
10689,ive put a call through to general scobie if i can get his authority ill surround the place and raid it
10690,well it appears that in there we have what one might loosely call a brain fifty megacycles liz if we can establish the frequency on which it operates
10691,doctor you were saying that this is some kind of brain
10692,but if it is has no physical form
10693,the plastics factory
10694,theres not much i can do except go over his head yes ill get on to the home secretary and if i dont get him to revoke that order ill go to unit headquarters in geneva
10695,the old fool just because he feels flattered they made a facsimile of him
10696,a plastic replica yes apparently they make these things for madame tussauds its one of their sidelines
10697,yes of course i think all that group are top civil servants hey thats odd theyre all government types there are no astronauts famous personalities you know people like that
10698,yes thats right sir these are plastic its an entirely new process
10699,general scobie
10700,i might do if it had to look really authentic
10701,im afraid not hes been out all day trying to see the home secretary i gather
10702,i dont like this
10703,oh i thought i heard something
10704,but when you talked about the watch you meant that this is the real general scobie
10705,someones coming
10706,what are you doing here© you shouldnt
10707,channing will
10708,ransome© i had to dismiss him because channing said
10709,channing is my partner new policy
10710,there is nothing to check we are finished here
10711,youve got to act quickly brigadier or else itll be too late by tomorrow
10712,its nearly half past five cant we take a break© i can hardly keep me eyes open
10713,are you sure© well get on to the police man try the army well keep trying
10714,the radios dead as well
10715,well now the globe has gone we cant be sure if this is really going to work
10716,well how can i© i cant even contact my support platoons
10717,just my headquarters staff
10718,destroy total destruction
10719,this isnt general scobie now listen to me  scobie 2
10720,youve killed him
10721,if were quick my dear we can save everybody a lot of trouble
10722,youre too late
10723,a lifeform perfectly adapted for survival and conquest on this planet
10724,no we have no individual identity
10725,humanly speaking yes
10726,you cannot destroy us
10727,no one has the power to destroy us not even you we are indestructible
10728,no one can destroy the nestenes
10729,i have
10730,now
10731,basically its the same as an ect machine electric convulsion therapy
10732,i think youll find the salary is quite adequate
10733,no doctor that car must be returned to its owner
10734,oh very well
10735,not yet i must arrange for a full set of papers first by the way ive just realised i dont even know your name
10736,spencer
10737,doctor
10738,youll never get that thing running
10739,are you really going to drive about in it
10740,urgent message from the brigadier
10741,yes well he wants us to join him miss shaw and the doctor will report themselves forthwith to wenley moor attend a briefing meeting at precisely
10742,oh its just his way of putting things
10743,come on doctor
10744,it would make a nice a nice trip for us we could visit the caves
10745,well that part of the countrys famous for them
10746,it is
10747,bessie
10748,i see
10749,it is our duty as scientists to deal with it ourselves only by exercising redoubled vigilance in all our duties can we track down the errors that are holding back the work of this research centre       lawrence
10750,right
10751,or rather in an atomic research centre which has been built into these caves
10752,exactly
10753,hello
10754,it bombards atoms with subatomic particles
10755,were developing a new kind of nuclear reactor one which converts nuclear energy directly to electrical power
10756,well its a highly complex piece of machinery naturally there are problems
10757,yes finally the purely scientific angle now the doctor here what is it doctor
10758,youre not proposing to dismantle a piece of equipment worth fifteen million pounds with a screwdriver
10759,yes let me take you both over the installation
10760,to the left
10761,heart of the cyclotron literally so in fact were actually inside the machine itself
10762,oh yes oh yes the cyclotron uses power in enormous quantities would you care to step down
10763,well theoretically
10764,that would be a decision for the director
10765,oh yes of course mister roberts take this young lady across to doctor meredith in the medical wing will you
10766,yes of course come this way please
10767,you dont mind if i carry on
10768,yes there are miles of them still in their natural state breathtaking ever been potholing
10769,no well im very keen on it at least i was until
10770,a couple of our junior technicians went exploring on their day off there was an accident one of them was killed the other is still in the sickbay
10771,no doctor meredith comes in from the local hospital
10772,well now im not sure they seem to be hushing it up
10773,i beg your pardon
10774,as far as we can see completely random
10775,excuse me a moment quinn here no no no two three six today now get that right two three six yes indeed
10776,excuse me yes
10777,what an extraordinary thing
10778,ah well that explains it spencers the chap who got hurt in the caves
10779,at what
10780,the others havent quite the same problem working continuously underground you hardly know day from night down here
10781,i take it youre yet another member of the unit team
10782,this is doctor meredith
10783,im sorry thats quite out of the question
10784,because i wont allow it thats why im about to have him moved into hospital besides you have no authority
10785,oh it seems i have no choice all right but i warn you it is at your own risk
10786,since he came out of his coma with occasional spells of trying to throttle me
10787,its the only thing that keeps him quiet
10788,not that i know of
10789,careful doctor
10790,are you all right i did warn you
10791,so was i whats made him like this
10792,no major baker you may not the doctor is my personal responsibility
10793,sir i shall be in my office sir
10794,the other end of the corridor
10795,well he slipped up badly once some years ago hes been trying to make up for it ever since youd better look out doctor he wants to run a security check on you
10796,i dont suppose youve found anything
10797,cave drawings on the walls my dear doctor if thats what you call evidence
10798,look this poor devil sees his friend killed in an accident he wanders around those caves for hours before they get him out well quite naturally he has some kind of breakdown
10799,now there you may have something could be sabotage i suppose
10800,or someone trying to cover up simple incompetence
10801,then i suggest you discover something i cant dismiss
10802,close down sector two
10803,i hope they can manage it anything we can do
10804,the power is back on full proton acceleration seven thousand million still rising roberts roberts roberts    quinn
10805,well theres a terrifically high rate of minor neuroses two hundred percent above the normal even for a place like this
10806,everyone who was affected worked at one time or another in the cyclotron room even i felt odd while i was there
10807,a feeling of oppression almost terror
10808,so you too think its something to do with the cyclotron room
10809,so
10810,that reminds me theres a report here on davis
10811,the police forwarded a copy
10812,even a map showing where they found him
10813,right sir
10814,well theyre not going to are they so we neednt worry
10815,you shouldnt have gone sir
10816,subterranean loch ness monster very helpful
10817,you werent very specific
10818,could it have been prehistoric
10819,in museums you mean
10820,what do you think doctor
10821,have you never heard of female emancipation
10822,well be a bit short on firepower
10823,yes well ill inform the director of my decision
10824,oh dont worry doctor well make sure your prehistoric friend gets a sporting chance we wont shoot until we see the whites of its eyes huh
10825,well doctor
10826,hey you there halt or i fire
10827,no idea sir we found him like this when we got here
10828,no something else bullets bullets wouldnt stop stop it
10829,what do you make of it doctor
10830,the prehistoric creature that attacked you
10831,wed better follow them doctor
10832,right morton give the doctor a hand the rest follow me
10833,well doctor
10834,well i know this may seem a little farfetched but there are resemblances to
10835,yes
10836,bad news doctor we lost it
10837,well theres a lot of moorland out there anyway it was getting dark
10838,ive sent to hq for some more men well mount a fullscale search in the morning doctor have you got any idea what were looking for
10839,well there was some bruising and one arm was clawed and theres a possibility of mild concussion
10840,he was attacked doctor just as you were
10841,which is
10842,davis was killed though
10843,its a bit hard to accept one monster let alone two still whatever it is well know in the morning
10844,so have we all
10845,he completed as many of the tests as he could and then he simply had to go and rest
10846,gone off to that cottage of his has he if he spent more time doing his job and less writing that book of his when he gets back tell him id like to see him would you if he can spare a moment
10847,doctor quinn works harder than anyone at this centre
10848,the doctors qualified to do almost everything
10849,nothing wrong with what
10850,you cant possibly be sure
10851,oh then what is the explanation of these power losses magic
10852,indeed and what do you propose to do about it
10853,out of the question it would mean a tremendous setback to our research programme
10854,that is your privilege director but whilst we are here perhaps youd let us carry on with our investigations
10855,lethbridgestewart yes yes i see thank you very much ill be there as soon as i can police i asked them to let me know of any unusual occurrences
10856,are they the same marks as you found on davis in the caves
10857,i thought you said the thing wasnt hostile
10858,shes at the local hospital suffering from shock
10859,yes of course
10860,then what was
10861,yes
10862,killed him

10877,well i really must be getting back to the centre
10878,im sorry i cant
10879,doctor look at the map

10881,rather like that sound we heard in the cave sir
10882,that noise it stopped
10883,look at these are these the same as the footprints as you saw in the cave
10884,then the thing cant be far from here
10885,car tracks

10887,yes
10888,yes yes i am

10893,thats very kind of you but ive already sent for the people who installed it
10894,what do you mean eh what do you mean
10895,doctor im sorry but i really must ask you to leave theres something very urgent i have to do before i go back to the centre

10899,yes here

10904,what are you talking about
10905,what about them
10906,oh i warned him
10907,ah doctor were due for a meeting with
10908,what was all that about
10909,unless i get it back to the caves it will die and i wont take it back until it tells me what i want to know
10910,i am perfectly all right thank you i propose that we move down there in force sir
10911,major baker isnt himself
10912,oh but i do i intend to send for more men and mount a full scale search of those caves
10913,doctor lawrence as i believe i have told you before
10914,now where are you going
10915,hello
10916,was quinn any help
10917,whats doctor quinn got to do with it
10918,may i remind you doctor that your business here is to investigate these power failures now do you have any suggestions to make
10919,not much chance of doctor lawrence agreeing to that
10920,whats wrong doctor what happened when you saw quinn
10921,oh no
10922,a silurian
10923,you saw it

10958,the mans a raving lunatic hes insolent hes impertinent he shows no respect for my authority
10959,yes how did you know
10960,now just a minute this is the permanent undersecretary
10961,may i ask who you are
10962,then ill have to go in with the troops i have
10963,what weapons do they have
10964,it is my job doctor how many are there

10966,ill find all the proof you need look doctor im not going down there to start a war but i must know whats going on
10967,what is your alternative doctor
10968,are you really convinced these silurians arent savage
10969,well move in first thing in the morning oh miss dawson id like a full statement from you everything you know about this business will you come with me please

10975,what happened i thought you were going to get help
10976,i repeat why have you come here
10977,how can you help us
10978,who are these people
10979,why do you want to help us
10980,you had no right to tell them about the brigadiers plans
10981,what guarantee have you got that these creatures arent going to set an ambush
10982,masters yes right thank you it was the unit people at the cave mouth theyve completely lost contact with the brigadier
10983,what do you think youre doing havent you done enough damage
10984,we have studied your weapons they are primitive
10985,be quiet
10986,shut up
10987,ive made my decision miss dawson
10988,this is our planet we were here before man we ruled this world millions of years ago
10989,a small planet was approaching the world we calculated that it would draw off our atmosphere destroying all life we built this place and suspended our lives till the atmosphere should return
10990,hey you wheres the doctor whats going on well where is he whats he telling you where are you doctor telling them everything they want to know youre nothing but a traitor
10991,the hibernation mechanism was faulty it did not function until a new energy source appeared
10992,yes we are now able to drain off its energy but soon we shall revive our civilisation and reclaim the earth for ourselves
10993,you
10994,there is not room for both civilisations
10995,would your people agree to this
10996,those apes have only shown hostility to us
10997,sir look its opening again
10998,do i have your assurance that the humans will agree to our sharing the planet
10999,very well i shall explain to the others so that you may return in safety
11000,i shall destroy you if you defy me again now go
11001,the other prisoner has been released
11002,doctor listen to me he has been infected with a deadly disease which may destroy millions of his species
11003,it is not my doing there are those of us unwilling to share this planet
11004,no but i have brought the bacteria perhaps your scientists can find a cure
11005,well i got away when they werent looking look it doesnt matter about me we must blow up every entrance to those caves before the silurians overrun us
11006,you
11007,what are you talking about
11008,wait
11009,he was no longer fit to lead us
11010,it would bring the centre to a standstill
11011,i refuse to permit this look edward cant you stop him this whole story is absurd
11012,im afraid i dont either you say these creatures have infected us with a plague but do you still want us to negotiate with them
11013,bakers gone doctor merediths just taken him to the hospital
11014,i tried he wouldnt listen
11015,but surely hospitals the right place for baker
11016,is he dead
11017,what do you mean keep back this man is ill
11018,come on
11019,unit leader to base unit leader to base
11020,yes nearly do you think pumping broadspectrum antibiotics into everyone is going to do any good
11021,will you roll up your sleeve please doctor
11022,now you have been exposed to the infection just as much as everyone else
11023,i know all about your different biochemistry but we dont know if it makes you immune now roll up your sleeve come on
11024,did it hurt
11025,have you managed to identify the bacterium
11026,itll be here doctor
11027,ive got the entire place cordoned off
11028,theyve all been treated weve sent in a medical team to help doctor meredith in the hospital
11029,yes theyve all been taken care of except doctor lawrence i cant find him anywhere
11030,do you think well be able to contain this disease doctor
11031,we were in contact with baker does that mean that were infected too
11032,oh ill let you get on with it
11033,masters is gone
11034,i will not be spoken to in that way
11035,doctor
11036,ministry of science please
11037,everything all right doctor
11038,not yet theyve sent a police car to the station
11039,doctor suppose im a carrier
11040,yes
11041,what do you think the silurians will do now doctor
11042,well ive got men at all the cave mouths and ive sent for reinforcements so well be ready for them if they do try anything
11043,you dont still think we can coexist with the silurians do you
11044,maybe one of the silurians is friendly but the rest seem determined to wipe us out
11045,come with me
11046,thats quite a collection
11047,where are you going to start
11048,yes of course
11049,attention please attention please this is a police message stay where you are do not attempt to leave the station if you feel ill assistance will be brought to you attention please attention please this is a police message stay where you are do not attempt to leave the station if you feel ill assistance will be brought to you
11050,that ambulance man you had brought back to the sick bay
11051,getting worse how are you getting on
11052,theyve sent you just about every drug in existence surely there must be something
11053,yes of course ill let you know as soon as i get any result thats at all positive goodbye
11054,well at least youve narrowed it down to forty possible drugs have you considered the addition of a thirty seven in the presence of z nineteen might well be effective
11055,sorry i feel dizzy
11056,what about you
11057,oh come on doctor i think you
11058,hes dead
11059,if only wed prevented masters from leaving here
11060,youve found the antidote
11061,yes his temperatures dropped and his pulse is normal
11062,how many humans have survived the epidemic
11063,you have discovered a cure
11064,since the epidemic has failed we must use other means we intend to make this planet uninhabitable for humans beings
11065,we shall continue to use the electricity of the humans
11066,put down that weapon
11067,we do not need these humans
11068,the other one is a soldier he is dangerous kill him
11069,brigadier
11070,you will take us to the nuclear generator or we will kill you all
11071,doctor what do you think youre doing
11072,you will now connect this device to the nuclear generator
11073,that is no concern of yours
11074,this is the molecular disperser it will convert the energy of the nuclear reactor into microwaves
11075,the microwaves will disperse the molecules of the filter belt which has enveloped this planet since our time
11076,you will now provide power to operate the dehibernation machinery and activate the disperser
11077,the doctor knows what hes doing trust him
11078,doctor that will
11079,yes
11080,number three rod check
11081,continue to increase the power
11082,you have destroyed the disperser
11083,remove the uranium from the reactor    doctor
11084,no they will all stay here to die from the radiation
11085,well hadnt you better close down the reactor
11086,you were surely bluffing them
11087,we cant
11088,no its still not working
11089,the megawattage is still rising
11090,you are still alive you tricked us
11091,doctor
11092,and just what do you think youre doing down here
11093,revive them
11094,splendid
11095,yes doctor
11096,good good well have a good journey
11097,shall i walk back and get some help
11098,whats that
11099,he must have had orders from the ministry
11100,no the government were frightened they just couldnt take the risk
11101,what are you doing
11102,whats that supposed to do
11103,come on now doctor

11107,but i havent been anywhere you vanished
11108,yes
11109,doctor i still dont understand
11110,well somethings happened to the mars probe
11111,i thought you werent interested  wakefield
11112,anything from the mars probe  wakefield
11113,i think theyre opening their hatch yes its them     van lyden
11114,when
11115,what do you mean cant remember
11116,where

11124,will you please get this man out of here were trying to save the lives of three astronauts
11125,how did you know that sound was going to be repeated
11126,answer who
11127,he is trying to help you know you might find him quite useful
11128,i mean that you could help professor cornish he is in charge here
11129,it seems youre right ill see about that computer
11130,do you want to crack the code send a reply
11131,but we know where the transmissions were coming from the capsule in orbit
11132,but arent we too late now
11133,thats haystack
11134,algonquin
11135,arecibo
11136,tokyos just promised full cooperation
11137,tokyo right that about covers the lot
11138,from where nancy oui
11139,right
11140,i have checked there is no capsule in go condition anywhere
11141,a what
11142,that machine will give you surface maps of every surveyed planet but a map of london no
11143,doctor never mind the map  yes yes fine yes thank you goodbye my people have just done a local triangulation
11144,coming  brigadier
11145,whats the trouble
11146,go and see doctor taltalian thats his department
11147,satisfied now if youll excuse me
11148,theyre locked on manual theres nothing we can do space control to recovery 7 do you read me space control to recovery 7 do you read me athens has reported a dangerous solar flare buildup it is imperative you unlock manual control so that we can bring you down     cornish
11149,rather more than you doctor
11150,hand it over
11151,doctor give me that tape
11152,doctor i think you
11153,ill go after him
11154,guards
11155,im quite unhurt taltalian
11156,what did you do with the tape
11157,the tape
11158,yes
11159,you didnt send it into the future did you
11160,thatll be the analogue digital converter
11161,let me
11162,he got away this place is like a rabbit warren ive set up a search
11163,the transmitter
11164,we took several prisoners one of them knows a great deal more than hes saying
11165,well have you decided to talk yet why didnt you shoot me when you had the chance
11166,i cant answer any questions
11167,no his pockets were empty
11168,the sort of thing you can buy anywhere but all the labels were cut out
11169,youre in very serious trouble you know i can hold you here on security charges for a very long time
11170,look i want answers from you and im going to get them
11171,this man knows something
11172,all right corporal
11173,yes thanks
11174,sir
11175,a soldier are you a deserter
11176,ten minutes too soon whats he think hes doing
11177,dont you want to see what happens
11178,notify global tracking stations fix an open communications circuit i want that capsule tracked every second
11179,perhaps because were feeding it nonsense maybe that sound from the capsule was just freak static
11180,i wonder
11181,well even that could go wrong ill feed it a standard test programme
11182,what
11183,this is ridiculous i checked that machine this morning
11184,it says two and two make five
11185,something wrong
11186,weve made it
11187,its impossible either the mechanisms jammed or
11188,then what are we going to do
11189,see you at the space centre
11190,get out of the way please
11191,will you please get out of the way sir were carrying a very important cargo
11192,yes they were very well organised we lost the capsule and the doctors vanished
11193,doctor thank heavens youre all right we found the car thought theyd got you
11194,no just the car
11195,cornish yes doctor its for you
11196,im not sure the equipments being connected now
11197,could be just random patterns
11198,who in the world would want to send a message in this form
11199,doctor you dont think that this intelligence
11200,exactly what are you suggesting
11201,well its extraordinary ive known bruno taltalian for years
11202,i can see your reasons for concern but you have got the capsule back now
11203,now im sure youll want to get back to the space centre
11204,all right wont you sit down
11205,charlie you are back at space control whats wrong open the hatch  van lyden
11206,its empty
11207,but we were talking to van lyden
11208,hello recovery 7 do you read me  van lyden
11209,then where are the astronauts
11210,no of course not
11211,why should they want to do that
11212,they sent us back to the control room while they searched the area
11213,no i didnt
11214,who would want to kidnap three astronauts
11215,i think ill have a word with my guard commander
11216,doctor
11217,i am not asking you
11218,youve been very thorough brigadier its a pity youve no explanation to offer for these strange occurrences
11219,all right
11220,no
11221,yes i was please sit down brigadier i realise i owe you all an apology i can only ask you to believe that everything i have done has been for the good of us all
11222,unit is an international organisation and the government wanted to keep this in its own hands
11223,we dont want the public to become panicstricken
11224,good well i hope this explanation has eased your minds gentlemen
11225,im sorry
11226,theres no need for that theyre in expert hands
11227,hello unit control this is the brigadier
11228,these seem to be the radiation records of the missing astronauts over two million rads they couldnt possibly have survived that amount
11229,two million one oh two four six two
11230,are you getting anywhere
11231,do you realise the importance of this
11232,these are the complete readings
11233,but radiation destroys human tissue
11234,and sir james quinlan and his immediate staff well doctor any luck
11235,well
11236,but they came down in the capsule they were here i saw them
11237,and you really think that theyre still in orbit in the mars probe
11238,their life support systems will be running down weve got to send up another recovery capsule
11239,ill get onto quinlan
11240,everythings taking just that little bit longer than it should
11241,seems like theyre getting in the way ill need to deal with them
11242,provided we can get the three thousand tons of rockets to go underneath it
11243,the brigadier he wants us to go down to hertfordshire to look at those bodies
11244,are you coming
11245,doctor
11246,well i started back an hour ago
11247,no need for that forensics cant tell us anything we cant see for ourselves look newspaper cutting in a foreign language
11248,what about this comb then with the makers imprint on it in the same language
11249,no the only people who could set up an organisation of this size would be foreign agents with enormous resources behind them
11250,they want to use the radiated astronauts as a weapon
11251,thats ridiculous
11252,astronauts do have walkietalkies in their helmets you know
11253,yes well perhaps he was recording the level of radioactivity in their bodies
11254,doctor nothing is to be gained by deciphering these impulses our objective should be to find the missing astronauts
11255,i was ordered to do that by general carrington i have computed the assembly of the rescue rocket as you asked me
11256,i would not have used that gun not on a fellow scientist
11257,have they found your assistant
11258,yes certainly and im sure doctor taltalian will be only too pleased to help you when you have a moment id like to see you in the control room about the recovery capsule
11259,what do you hope to learn from them
11260,to make a start we must have some idea
11261,this could take a long time
11262,excuse me hello taltalian here yes who is that a moment please it is for you
11263,they have found her
11264,where would i go
11265,what sort of a electronic device
11266,in defiance of the message threatening miss shaws life
11267,who would do that
11268,you are being most insulting
11269,i acted under the orders of general carrington
11270,what people are you talking about
11271,have you told the brigadier about your suspicions
11272,why not if you are so sure of your facts
11273,i dont know what you are talking about
11274,all right ill deal with him and since your own skins in danger you can help me
11275,then why accuse him
11276,taltalian was acting under carringtons orders quinlan explained that
11277,why not
11278,then what is happening doctor
11279,whats this
11280,right ill see to it
11281,miss shaw
11282,no nothing were doing all we can
11283,every available astronaut is suddenly not available not fit transferred to other duties waiting for security clearance
11284,all what goods a rocket without a pilot
11285,thank you doctor but i dont think you realise just whats necessary
11286,doctor i dont think you realise whats
11287,well if you insist you can take the tests
11288,hello doctor i was just coming over to see you
11289,well let me have them as soon as possible will you ill see about those tests doctor
11290,yes
11291,i will tell you everything if you will give me a chance to get away
11292,the information i need is in my car i will go and fetch it you will wait for me here
11293,you seem to have been right about taltalian
11294,he was obviously trying to plant a time bomb on you lucky for you the mechanism was faulty
11295,so whoever gave it to him wanted to get rid of both of you
11296,another dead end then
11297,whats that
11298,halt halt or ill fire
11299,so you were right they arent human
11300,we could contact the astronauts or whatever they are
11301,yes yes hes here sir james quinlan
11302,doctor id like to know if its still your intention to pilot the recovery rocket
11303,i cant persuade you that your action will be disastrous
11304,then you leave me no choice will you come and see me please me at once
11305,im coming with you
11306,doctor
11307,look at these bullets flattened
11308,so theres no way of stopping them
11309,so they were taken away in a vehicle
11310,conquest
11311,for the first two and a half minutes fifteen tons per second we have to use a mixture of standard fuel and the new m3 variant
11312,no we cant get enough of the standard fuel in time
11313,harder thank you everythings wrapped up in red tape until they appoint a successor oh this is your medical report doctor
11314,oh this is incredible according to this you
11315,you havent the authority to forbid it general
11316,an alien invasion with the collaboration of a foreign power
11317,you havent answered my question doctor
11318,then thats what it should be used for
11319,this launch was against the expressed wishes of sir james quinlan
11320,time you were in the preparation room doctor
11321,whyve you advanced liftoff time
11322,astronaut now due in preparation chamber
11323,astronaut ready now proceeding through quarantine area to capsule
11324,i thought id see you off they told me to wait here
11325,some sort of waiting room i imagine in case theres any holdup for the astronauts
11326,well goodbye doctor good luck
11327,fuel injection report acknowledged control to capsule have you completed your instrument check
11328,we cant hurry the m3 variant
11329,it would worry you if the rocket blew up on lift off
11330,you all set doctor lift off fifteen seconds
11331,radar check stage one exploded immediately after separation
11332,thirty second burn on stage three rocket and youll be in orbit     cornish
11333,you are within half a mile of mars probe 7 and converging change attitude of capsule three degrees starboard now change attitude of capsule three degrees starboard now
11334,doctor be careful we dont really now whats in there
11335,doctor a large unidentified object is approaching you on collision course            cornish
11336,if they had the capsules would be smashed to fragments
11337,oh do you happen to know how long were going to be kept here
11338,i say any idea when were going to see our families
11339,why you ought to know
11340,yes of course i brought these two fellows back from mars probe 7 they slapped us in extended quarantine
11341,just what do you want
11342,who let him in here
11343,oh come on
11344,something happened
11345,it was necessary to for their health they were deteriorating
11346,why have you not returned our ambassadors
11347,an agreement was made you have betrayed us unless our ambassadors are returned we shall destroy your world
11348,no i think we should wait but theres only one hope left to us that the doctor is still alive
11349,that is difficult to believe
11350,but you do not even know where they are
11351,very well but if our ambassadors are not returned we shall use our weapons to destroy your world
11352,something happened
11353,oh er send us something in to eat will you
11354,you can relax it wont be long now
11355,because it suits me how is he
11356,doctor are you all right
11357,no i dont much care for the company though
11358,doctor theyre a completely alien species
11359,how did you talk to them
11360,like this
11361,could you build me a better one so i could really talk to them
11362,youve got your chance now
11363,it would keep you both alive
11364,make a list
11365,dont try it
11366,i got out once but they caught me now theyve doubled the guards
11367,are you really going to help them
11368,how on earth did you find us
11369,youre not surprised to see me
11370,im surprised to see you doctor my instructions were that you were to be killed
11371,could you make us a better machine
11372,and youre willing to help us
11373,doctor
11374,we must alert the world to the menace of an alien invasion
11375,at any time
11376,ambassadors that was just to put us off our guard
11377,why else should they invade the galaxy they were on mars before we were
11378,yes they killed jim jim daniels fellow astronaut simply by touching him
11379,and now theyve walked into my trap i knew that once i got them here id make them reveal their true natures
11380,it was the only way to arouse public opinion
11381,they didnt know either it was the only way
11382,it was the only way you do understand that dont you doctor
11383,exactly we must protect the world its our moral duty will you help us
11384,right sir  general carringtons men have captured an alien astronaut hes going to bring it here
11385,how longs it going to take
11386,doctor
11387,theyll be back
11388,youre not just going to do as he tells you
11389,i shall call on the nations of the world to unite in an attack on the aliens and their spacecraft it must be obliterated
11390,mmm hmm
11391,okay
11392,do you think the signal will be strong enough
11393,right
11394,no not yet
11395,he is going to call on the nations of the world to attack it blast it out of the sky with missiles
11396,right
11397,it doesnt work
11398,now you see the main vault is here and our friends there can blast it open
11399,make yourselves at home
11400,carringtons taken over the space centre
11401,hes going to make a telecast urging the world to attack the alien spaceship
11402,not so easy hes arrested all my men and moved in his own troops
11403,why dont you use them
11404,get him out of here
11405,open the gates open these gates
11406,i had to do what i did it was my moral duty you do understand dont you
11407,doctor where are my three astronauts
11408,exchange
11409,but what about the fuel problem
11410,this is control get me the fuel bay
11411,doctor ill need your help to communicate with the ambassadors
11412,goodbye doctor
11413,no we dont want a panic
11414,how are you doctor
11415,well dont you recognise one
11416,fifth from the left third row
11417,trouble seems to follow you doesnt it doctor
11418,you persuade me to allow you and miss shaw to attend this project as observers
11419,and within a few hours of your arrival i have a motiveless murder on my hands
11420,late yesterday afternoon one of the technicians was beaten to death with this
11421,the wrench was found near the body it belongs to a drillhead rigger called harry slocum were still looking for him
11422,something else doctor try touching the wrench
11423,when it was first found it was red hot as though it had been in a furnace any theories
11424,doctor why were you so keen to observe this project
11425,yes of course
11426,youre taking part in the project
11427,look theres another one
11428,hello doc
11429,and what do you think of this project doc

11431,all those socalled experts its a waste of valuable time and money
11432,morning sir
11433,no were still searching for him
11434,yes still you should be safe in there im sure this harry slocum character wont have one of your funny gadgets
11435,ive isolated one of the faults
11436,oh did you get those figures from the computer
11437,well ill check them again anyway how are things at central control
11438,oh did you see the brigadier
11439,i know one of the sentries was in earlier making a spot check he told me about it
11440,doctor youre not still thinking of making a run with the tardis console are you
11441,now be sensible its too dangerous
11442,when do you want to make this trial run
11443,hey youre not serious why the sudden rush
11444,yes
11445,i wish youd think again
11446,right

11465,what about these two
11466,shock
11467,doctor i need some answers
11468,what did happen to slocum
11469,i dont understand
11470,it looked as if he was turning into some sort of animal
11471,ill have the devil of a job keeping this quiet
11472,that noise he was making ive never heard anything like that before
11473,where
11474,doctor are you telling me that theres some link between slocum and the volcanic eruption in krakatoa
11475,come on
11476,well if he does hes a darn sight cleverer than the rest of us
11477,then we shall just have to wait till it cools down a bit wont we
11478,and who the devil asked you
11479,based on what
11480,ill examine that stuff in the labs what do you think
11481,hear it
11482,doctor i think you ought to come and look at the main computer
11483,well as you say brigadier they are your problems please deal with them as you see fit
11484,yes
11485,that computer is oversensitive its data is unreliable
11486,my own calculations are more specific
11487,well what
11488,stand back everybody
11489,i prefer to rely on my own judgement ive been concerned with this operation for eleven years and i know more about the details surrounding it than any machine
11490,what message
11491,that computer as i have said is inaccurate
11492,you may find that rather difficult we cant supply you with any more nuclear power
11493,we need all the energy we can get i propose to accelerate the drilling by twelve percent cut the power to the doctors hut not to be reconnected under any circumstances
11494,im sorry doctor
11495,mister phillips professor stahlman has decided to modify the drilling rate could you join us at the computer please
11496,what do you want me to do that for
11497,all right
11498,youd do well to mind your own business doctor
11499,doctor what on earth do you think youre doing
11500,then i suggest you let him go
11501,will someone please explain whats going on here
11502,well doctor will you please tell me whats going on here
11503,brigadier this man is trying to sabotage my project
11504,oh very well  left hand  right hand satisfied now get that man out of my sight
11505,well it isnt there now and after all he is in charge
11506,two of the bypass wires were burnt out but apart from that everything seems all right
11507,yes
11508,what was all that business at central control
11509,well with the nuclear power cut off were just wasting our time arent we
11510,at least you wont be able to make any trial runs
11511,im afraid youll never know for sure doctor
11512,yes
11513,epsilon coordinates you usually work those out in your head
11514,yes all right doctor
11515,professor stahlman seems determined to blow us all to kingdom come the doctor has vanished into thin air and i have a number of unsolved murders on my hands i promise you miss shaw im worried
11516,come on come on come on    benton 2
11517,put your hands up

11545,yes
11546,executed all of them
11547,you are talking of the republican security forces and the reason we are here is that this is a scientific labour camp
11548,we are in danger
11549,youre very well informed
11550,what do you know about him
11551,you condemn yourself no one but a spy could know so much
11552,where
11553,very well i can wait
11554,we work to an orderly system your identity is being checked with central records when we know who you are the real interrogation will begin
11555,you are giving us a great deal of trouble
11556,youd make things much easier for yourself if youll tell us who you are
11557,unless you cooperate youll soon be in front of a firing squad you have very little time left
11558,no director sorry director three bags full director
11559,get back get back to your posts if this place goes up well all go up with it get back or we fire  stahlman 2
11560,not yet ill take charge of him

11562,leave it alone its none of your concern
11563,take him into the office
11564,let him try weve got nothing to lose
11565,he has repaired the computer director  stahlman 2
11566,can you transcribe what the computers saying

11569,it looks to me as if its getting pretty well smashed up as it is now
11570,right come on doctor williams  stahlman 2
11571,you seem to know a great deal about this project
11572,youre a scientist
11573,where do you come from
11574,if you told us the truth there might be some hope for you
11575,this other woman the one that looks like me
11576,what does she do
11577,i am a security officer so theres no possible link is there
11578,i read physics at university whats that got to do with it
11579,not particularly
11580,yes i see thank you the emergency is over
11581,your idea worked
11582,you find the idea of death amusing

11585,we have other methods
11586,everybody talks

11590,director  stahlman 2
11591,benton take him away down to the security cells
11592,i tell you stahlmans a nut well arent you going to report me get me a week in the punishment cells things are looking up a couple of days ago youd have reported me without a second thought
11593,your interrogation isnt over yet
11594,now well start again who are you how did you get into the complex
11595,the questions will go on until you answer them
11596,you have told us nothing
11597,now perhaps we can talk reasonably
11598,if you like
11599,believe me i really am trying to help you
11600,no no youre too conspicuous to be a spy no ive got a theory that youre from one of these crackpot free speech groups trying to make some crazy demonstration
11601,look if youll give me a full confession i may be able to convince them that youre some harmless lunatic youll get away with a few years in a labour camp
11602,i can see ive been wasting my time ill leave you to the brigade leader hell get the truth out of you
11603,well hes better off out of it wherever he is
11604,whats the noise all about
11605,zero minus forty seconds
11606,all personnel stand by
11607,you cant do that its just murder
11608,zero minus thirty seconds countdown moves to final phase
11609,zero minus twenty seconds
11610,yes
11611,dont worry ive never seen a bore i couldnt cap yet
11612,stahlman if youre thinking of going in there youd better put this suit on
11613,come on doctor
11614,oh what the devil hit me
11615,is the director still in there
11616,why didnt he come out with you
11617,weve got to get the director out
11618,what does it say
11619,thick enough ferrous concrete steel plating asbestos sheeting the lot it could stand up to an atomic blast
11620,perhaps theyre the sensible ones
11621,thats correct
11622,i do he talks a lot of good sense doctor
11623,surely there must be some way of sealing the shaft why dont the government evacuate us all and blow up the whole area
11624,all right but we must cap the bore somehow
11625,well doctor what is going to happen
11626,how long have we got
11627,so its doomsday we just sit back and wait for it
11628,rather surprising
11629,the fire extinguisher
11630,you just dont listen do you you heard what he said theres nothing we can do is that right doctor
11631,i will not listen to treason
11632,theres nothing we can do absolutely nothing
11633,you said wed passed the point of no return
11634,even now you stick to this absurd story
11635,and were all somehow duplicated there
11636,save them how
11637,you mean that oddlooking contraption we found in the hut
11638,could it take you back
11639,but if this other world is parallel theyll be in same situation as us
11640,you expect us to believe that you came here in this
11641,but this isnt a vehicle at all
11642,and wheres the rest of it
11643,you said you needed a power source to make this thing work
11644,i think weve seen enough of this nonsense come on
11645,i said nothing of the kind this contraption is obviously incapable of taking anyone anywhere we shall return to central control
11646,if you could give us some proof doctor a demonstration
11647,well
11648,doctor doctor
11649,what happened where were you
11650,stay away from that
11651,if the power was connected you could make the journey back
11652,and take others with you
11653,why not
11654,it is the director weve got to do what he says and let him out of there
11655,but hes alive
11656,director
11657,why dont they attack
11658,now theyve covered both exits
11659,benton get out    benton 2
11660,well we shouldnt have just left benton you dont mind sacrificing your men do you brigade leader
11661,well not now there isnt hes probably been killed by those things
11662,well why did you cut them off from the drill head
11663,it makes very little difference as were all trapped in here anyway
11664,how long have we got
11665,you said you had a plan just now what is it
11666,what are you doing
11667,only the bare minimum the reactor must still be working off robot control
11668,well in an emergency the master switch automatically shuts down the reactor banks
11669,the master switch is in central control how do we get through that lot
11670,you mean the pistol
11671,if that master switch has been damaged itll be a long job resetting it
11672,doctor youve got a monster sized fire extinguisher just waiting for you in there
11673,i cant breathe
11674,look out
11675,is he dead
11676,well what do we do now
11677,theyre coming
11678,what about you
11679,you go if you want to brigade leader
11680,i think ill hang around a bit longer the natives are getting restless again
11681,how are you making out
11682,doctor
11683,when you get back to that other place
11684,how are you going to make sure they stop their drilling
11685,but hes dead
11686,times running out doc
11687,right you are doctor
11688,ill check the inner corridor
11689,i have to reroute the entire electrical system before i can boost the power
11690,what about the brigade leader and me
11691,isnt there anything we can do
11692,we can pick that up at the riggers stores youll pass it on the way to the hut
11693,yes were sitting on a powder keg
11694,so thats the contraption is it
11695,well i thought itd be a bit more impressive than that
11696,and this brought you all the way here did it
11697,will it take you back
11698,well is it all right
11699,right i hate to tell you but if we put the entire output of the nuclear reactor through this itll blow in the first few seconds
11700,if we get you back doctor youd better make darn sure they stop their drilling id hate to think all this was for nothing
11701,right and cross our fingers and trust to luck
11702,whats happened to them they should be back here by now
11703,if those explosions reach the nuclear reactor
11704,get out get out both of you
11705,theyre coming all three of them well done petra are you ready doctor
11706,im sorry i couldnt get the power through i did all i could

11763,well i believe he is driving her to london in his car
11764,no well goodbye doctor

11767,doctor youre not still tinkering with this machine after all the trouble its caused us
11768,well he did try to warn everybody brigadier
11769,so you went gallivanting off in a fit of pique
11770,in the tardis console
11771,oh but doctor you cant

11773,where did you go
11774,the rubbish tip
11775,oh dear

11777,oh so you it want the hard way do you© right         museum attendant
11778,doctor i er
11779,its all right ive dealt with it
11780,but your bench was on fire
11781,but this whole place might have gone up in flames
11782,im not the tea lady
11783,ive
11784,im your new assistant
11785,the brigadier sent me along to introduce myself doctor josephine grant
11786,im a fully qualified agent you know cryptology safe breaking explosives
11787,i took general science at alevel
11788,im sorry i ruined your experiment
11789,the brigadier wanted me to show you this report
11790,something was stolen for the natural space museum it was on loan from this hq
11791,a translucent polyhedron eight and a half inches in diameter
11792,apparently they wanted it for a special display the brigadier signed the authorisation
11793,but youve just got to be joking
11794,youve been agitating for a new assistant ever since miss shaw went back to cambridge
11795,nonsense what you need doctor as miss shaw herself so often remarked is someone to pass you your test tubes and to tell you how brilliant you are miss grant will fulfil that function admirably
11796,no i couldnt agree more doctor but miss grant was very keen to join us and she happens to have relatives in high places
11797,very well doctor ill reassign her
11798,but i think you should break the news to her yourself
11799,and ive chased those electronic spares you wanted they promised delivery tomorrow without fail
11800,thank you doctor report from one our field sections sir captain yates some kind of sabotage at a radio telescope two of their scientists have disappeared
11801,the directors expecting you sir
11802,no sir it seems to have happened in the control cabin in the top of that tower
11803,i do hope you can spare a moment or two doctor
11804,i am travelling incognito
11805,we time lords dont care to be conspicuous some of us that is
11806,i came to warn you an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet
11807,the master
11808,hell certainly try to kill you doctor the tribunal thought that you ought to be made aware of your danger
11809,you are incorrigibly meddlesome doctor but weve always felt that your hearts are in the right places but be careful the master has learnt a great deal since you last met him
11810,his degree in cosmic science was of a higher class than yours
11811,look through the door but be careful
11812,itll explode and probably destroy this research centre completely you see hes rigged it up so that it opening the door will make it fall such an amusing idea
11813,how do you do© i hope you realise the police have already investigated this matter
11814,he and miss grant are questioning the staff
11815,goodge must have left in quite a hurry
11816,the people i represent mister farrel can never have too much plastic
11817,oh a nestene© er its a bit difficult to describe exactly
11818,i didnt say i passed urgh an octopus
11819,at least we should be ready for them this time
11820,the radio telescope is their bridgehead they used that to contain energy into that surviving nestene unit
11821,yes im well aware of the urgency of the situation doctor if we had some idea where its been taken
11822,really© well the research boysll be glad to get their hands on this
11823,doctor weve got the box down here  doctor
11824,strewth theres going be some complaints about that you know doctor
11825,well i understood that under hypnosis it was impossible for
11826,thats right
11827,yes farrel the human body has a basic weakness one that i which i shall exploit to assist in the destruction of humanity
11828,its no good i think were just wasting
11829,doctor© doctor you
11830,doctor
11831,there was an explosion
11832,the box i had to open it there was a voice

11835,there was a desk
11836,a telephone
11837,yes yes an office

11840,yes im fine thank you
11841,i just wanted to say how sorry i am
11842,the bomb i might have killed you all
11843,no im afraid i havent ive tried and tried to remember
11844,yes well we cant just sit about waiting for something to pop up from miss grants mind if my agents dont turn up something soon im going to surround and search every factory on that list
11845,well sergeant benton noticed that the turf was all churned up so he did a bit of checking and he found that a circus had just left
11846,ill get some of my men down there with photographs of philips someone at the circus may have seen him
11847,all right doctor ill get you an escort
11848,miss grant
11849,you see the bomb was by way of being a greetings card a small little gallantry on the eve of battle the car will lure the doctor to the circus and there i shall destroy him
11850,into me wagon quick
11851,smith© youve got no imagination try again mister smith
11852,his names none of your business

11874,its some sort of a quarry
11875,look out
11876,ten the enemy intention
11877,there was no sign of alien activity at the circus this mysterious horsebox had vanished so had the autons
11878,not quite
11879,i therefore propose that we redouble our security here and concentrate on finding the masters headquarters
11880,safe and sound doctor
11881,captain yates we will continue this conference in my office
11882,you wait there and ill show you
11883,doctor doctor stop being childish

11889,maybe hes given up
11890,doctor this is mister brownrose from the ministry hes come to us with a rather alarming story
11891,how do you do i hope hes qualified to deal with a matter of this complexity
11892,its not something to be shuffled off onto some stray boffin you know
11893,doctor please
11894,oh cant i sir© now ill have you know that my
11895,lord rowlands is head of our department yes

11900,production manager and retired owner of the same plastics factory
11901,ive already been over it with the police
11902,oh the death of mister mcdermott upset him of course and i do know he was very disturbed about developments within the firm
11903,well he seemed to think that rex our son he seemed to think that hed fallen too much under the influence of a new customer my husband didnt like him at all
11904,colonel masters
11905,thats it then
11906,well er i believe hes still working with rex ive been too upset to think about the business

11908,well wasnt my idea of a doll at all
11909,yes of course
11910,it wasnt intended for children naturally some sort of a novelty for grown ups i suppose its odd you know

11915,i have a requisition for you top priority
11916,electrode unit
11917,thats it thank you the equipments on its way doctor
11918,quite a while im afraid theyve had to send out for most of it
11919,im very sorry doctor
11920,now just a moment doctor im aware for your preference for acting as a oneman band but this does happen to be a unit operation
11921,yes thats quite true but if anybody could you could youre dead right wed be in terrible trouble could you© could you really© youre a dolly scotsman mister campbell yes of course
11922,what do you want it for© they give these things away with soap
11923,i wish i knew
11924,yes
11925,oh nothing much here unless this might be something
11926,farrels ordered a coach this week a fifteenseater
11927,yeah
11928,seems as though you may be right doctor
11929,well its dead enough now
11930,i was on the telephone
11931,i wasnt here id just gone out to er fetch some cocoa
11932,cocoa
11933,that was the general idea im sorry doctor
11934,well yes
11935,okay
11936,im afraid i cut your connection
11937,message from the brigadier
11938,its about these daffodils
11939,well er theyre handing out daffodils
11940,chaps in weird carnival masks touring round in a coach
11941,no they didnt weve got no idea at all im afraid we dont even know how long theyve been doing it the thing is the brigadier wants to know if the daffs are dangerous
11942,this is a section of that daffodil im trying to find out its molecular structure
11943,they will if i can translate them
11944,weve located that coach load of nestene autons distributing those daffodils doctor
11945,theyre hiding in that same quarry where they took you
11946,i couldnt say you might be able to identify him afterwards
11947,ive got the raf to lay on a rocket strike in a few hours time that coach should be a pile of scrap iron
11948,im sorry doctor i cant afford to take that risk if that coach moves to a populated area itll be impossible to destroy it the strike will go ahead as planned
11949,see you doc bye jo
11950,thats a face a part of one
11951,hello greyhound this is trap one do you read me© over  there seems to be something wrong hello greyhound this is trap one do you read me© over
11952,its alive
11953,it seems to be looking for something
11954,yes of course
11955,okay
11956,no the air strikes due to begin in thirty seven minutes if the doctors coming up with anything hed better be quick
11957,i hope im not interrupting anything important
11958,but not without considerable regret
11959,you see doctor youre my intellectual equal almost i have so few worth opponents when theyve gone i always miss them
11960,oh dont be trivial doctor i see youve been working on the nestene autojet my own small contribution to their invasion plan
11961,now come come doctor death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly
11962,oh by a radio impulse which the nestenes will send i shall open the channel for them weve distributed four hundred and fifty thousand of these daffodils so when four hundred and fifty thousand people fall dead the country will be disrupted
11963,you were quite right
11964,oh no
11965,that is your last mistake
11966,youre bluffing on an empty hand doctor
11967,you underestimate me doctor let me be quite plain either you hand that unit over to me now or i kill miss grant
11968,dont hes beaten already theyre going to bomb the quarry
11969,now because of the change in circumstances were going to have to bring our schedule forward what were going to do is this its absolutely essential that we
11970,doctor if youre going to drive i want to get off
11971,do you read me© over
11972,funny you should say that look
11973,right sir
11974,no get out there all of you keep those soldiers back
11975,doctor look
11976,an amateur landing of course not the way i planned it
11977,impossible theyve taken control no one can stop them now your precious little planet is finished
11978,nonsense i helped them to come here
11979,its no good sir we just cant hold them
11980,well youd better try it and quick
11981,yes
11982,well doctor it worked
11983,hes gone
11984,sir hes in the coach sir weve got him now
11985,well thats the end of him
11986,hes probably left earth by now
11987,so the one he took from you
11988,and now hes stuck here on earth
11989,you dont seem very worried about it
11990,it looks like draculas castle
11991,doctor youll need this
11992,what
11993,right passes checked and satisfactory right open the gates
11994,temporary disturbance it sounds like a fullscale riot
11995,then why did you insist on coming here
11996,oh yes
11997,ladies and gentlemen good morning
11998,well as youre no doubt aware we no longer execute our hardened criminals and killers modern society has progressed far beyond that primitive form of retribution today science
11999,science has abolished the hangmans noose and substituted this infallible method professor emil keller
12000,for the benefit of the less sophisticated members of my audience i will explain in very simple terms professor emil keller the inventor of this process discovered that antisocial behaviour was governed by certain negative or evil impulses now this machine the keller machine extracts these impulses and leaves a rational wellbalanced individual
12001,may i be permitted to continue
12002,thank you the condemned man is placed here  after being tranquillised with his head under this dome a series of probes are attached to his skull so as to connect with the neural circuits the extraction process is controlled here the negative impulses are stored in that reservoir box there
12003,nowhere sir i repeat they are stored in the box
12004,let the sentence of the court been carried out
12005,a minor malfunction the machine compensated the process is completed satisfactorily
12006,the subject will be taken away to recuperate and within an hour or two he will be perfectly normal
12007,yes of course governor
12008,an excess of negative particles the machine overreacted
12009,how interesting though i fail to see what concern it is
12010,i dont know sir i was coming along the corridor and i heard him screaming
12011,probably a heart attack delayed shock from seeing the process
12012,doctor did you see his face he looks terrified and those marks like
12013,look i think wed better get on to the brigadier
12014,all right anyway i dont think hed thank us for disturbing him right now
12015,he did tell you all about it doctor
12016,mmm pity shes quite a dolly
12017,yes of course it is i mean youve just seen barnham
12018,look emil keller himself installed it here i worked closely with him i know every facet of the process
12019,what
12020,well its hardly your concern is it
12021,the deceaseds name was arthur linwood a medical student in his final year
12022,but he didnt have a weak heart mister kettering
12023,yes i called his hospital he suffered from a fear of certain animals
12024,well apparently in the laboratory he was absolutely terrified of
12025,yes
12026,you must be mistaken
12027,because of heart failure
12028,i tell you that mans death had nothing to do with this machine and if you were a scientist youd understand
12029,im not sure its incredible really
12030,from the position of the body tinge of the skin
12031,but thats ridiculous
12032,shall i go and check on his medical record
12033,that must have been about the time the riot started
12034,are you suggesting theres some connection
12035,oh come now doctor its only a machine
12036,well ive no authority to do that ill report your recommendations to the home office but theyll have to decide
12037,im sorry doctor thats my final word ill suspend further use of the keller process ill put this room out of bounds but thats all i can do without higher authority
12038,can i help
12039,is that wise
12040,well then
12041,nearly a year emil keller came over from switzerland to supervise the installation
12042,theres nothing there come and sit theres nothing doctor its me jo its all right
12043,well you wanted this report on kettering i got it from doctor summers
12044,i thought it was important
12045,me killed it seemed that you were the one in danger you looked as if you were fighting something that wasnt there
12046,you were right about kettering he did have a morbid fear of water
12047,doctor what did you see
12048,but why should you
12049,this fire you saw it wasnt real
12050,if this machines so dangerous why not just blow it up destroy it
12051,the brigadiers orders im afraid doctor youve got to come back to london with me
12052,youve got to doctor
12053,im sorry doctor youre coming back with me even if i have to use force

12065,we are going to see the new chinese delegate mister fu peng
12066,later
12067,oh mister fu peng im brigadier lethbridge stewart of unit command im in charge of all security arrangements and this is our scientific advisor
12068,thank you for your courtesy and welcome it is i who am delighted to meet such a charming person in this barbaric country  it is rare to meet a westerner who knows my language
12069,on the contrary it is excellent
12070,tsetung but that is the personal name of our chairman mao tsetung

12124,hold it mailer let me have that gun i think youd better show our patient into the chair mailer and handcuff him into it
12125,now this little device as you know transmits and amplifies the power of the machine what you may not know is that it can be adjusted to turn that power against the wearer like this
12126,is it oh i really would like to stop and watch your nightmares

12167,very well then to save one life
12168,am i unless the doctor does what i ask miss grant mailer will shoot you here and now
12169,and now is your chance to put that theory to the test
12170,temporarily glutted no doubt
12171,oh stangmoor prisons a very progressive place the entire contents of the workshops at your disposal
12172,look doctor you must hurry if that thing in there starts moving again

12201,thats you finished i warned you i only need one of you
12202,yes thanks
12203,sorry sir he seems to have got away
12204,isnt it here
12205,oh
12206,im rather more concerned with finding that missile
12207,who is this man
12208,well that about wraps it up doctor
12209,i said that about wraps it up
12210,major cosworths throwing a cordon around that hangar now ill join him at mobile hq and then well move in and mop things up
12211,i dont anticipate much trouble
12212,dont worry doctor he wont get the chance you coming with me
12213,yes well er ill leave the machine to you and you can leave master to me
12214,sergeant benton will look after you wont you sergeant

12218,whats wrong
12219,something terrible
12220,no
12221,no
12222,but i dont understand
12223,and barnham hasnt got any
12224,cant you kill it now doctor
12225,so what are we going to do
12226,im scared its evil
12227,i think so doctor extra heavy duty cable arrangements with the national complex for a maximum power boost ill get onto it right away
12228,its going to take quite a bit of organising
12229,its for you doctor says hes an old friend of yours
12230,oh doctor do i gather that the tables have turned somewhat at stangmoor
12231,yes and if barnham leaves here that thing will kill all of us
12232,exactly and then later when this planet is in ruins i shall take over     master
12233,are you offering me a deal
12234,but you will bring that circuit to me here at the hanger you and you alone at the first sign of treachery the first sign of interference from your unit friends and i launch the missile immediately
12235,well i think so doctor he should be back at mobile hq by now
12236,now you do exactly what miss grant tells you all right good lad
12237,dont you worry doctor leave everything to us ive cancelled the attack and well send a dispatch rider to hq to get your circuit just in case
12238,the brigadier knows what hes doing doctor
12239,but i dont see why youre so upset if you give him back the circuit and he hands over the missile
12240,then youll just have to give in the masters got the missile and all weve got is this wretched machine
12241,i said all weve got is this machine
12242,i dont understand
12243,dont worry it cant hurt you
12244,its all right
12245,right sir
12246,we tried to explode thunderbolt on the ground doctor but nothing happened
12247,theres only one thing for it doctor well have to give him back that wretched circuit
12248,just arrived sir
12249,believe me doctor i hate to see the master escape unpunished as much as you do
12250,unless youve got some better plan i can see no alternative
12251,very strange form of transport doctor i hope youre not going to try anything silly
12252,bessie
12253,i think i should warn you that my  is aimed and ready to fire i just have to press the requisite button
12254,shall we get on with it did you bring the circuit with you
12255,may i examine it please
12256,im afraid you dont youll just have to trust me this once
12257,now doctor
12258,were on our way over and out
12259,we took barnham there to help us
12260,we should never have left him there
12261,sorry
12262,well at least were rid of the keller machine and the master
12263,well even if he wasnt killed doctor he wont get far if youve still got his circuit
12264,probably destroyed in the explosion
12265,yes its for you doctor
12266,ah doctor i was afraid youd be worried about me so i thought id let you know that im alive and well
12267,i made the safety of my tardis which thanks to your generosity is in perfect working order
12268,but one day i will destroy this miserable planet and you along with it goodbye doctor oh by the way enjoy your exile
12269,never mind doctor youve beaten him
12270,forget it
12271,doctor
12272,i have a duty to my country
12273,no idea sir
12274,im sorry sir you are a security risk
12275,ive no idea  radar 1
12276,compute target area  radar 1
12277,chinn here mod you know im coordinating this operation dont you well i want you to be ready to destroy this thing the moment i give the word oh you are ready good well stand by then
12278,just a precaution doctor
12279,a perfect sitting target
12280,what destroyed©  radar 2
12281,it cant have disappeared  bell
12282,ive arranged with the army for full artillery support
12283,sir george professor winser the doctor is our scientific advisor
12284,doctor look
12285,well lets hear it  axos
12286,brigadier we cant wait any longer we must attack now before they have time to reorganise their defences
12287,i agree
12288,right sir     axos
12289,all right ill stay here         axos
12290,axonite is the source of all our growth technology axonite can absorb convert transmit and programme all forms of energy
12291,axonite is shall we say the chameleon of the elements it is a thinking molecule it uses the energy it absorbs not only to copy but to recreate and restructure any given substance
12292,unlimited food
12293,i must make my report to the minister i think i can take care of this perpetual interference from these unit people
12294,i saw this thing it was shapeless and horrible and
12295,yes well i think we ought to look to the future too there are tremendous advantages for humanity in axonite
12296,captain i want all these men put under twenty four hour armed guard they are to see no one no one at all do you understand© if you need me i shall be with sir george
12297,apparently not and when they touched it it just disintegrated there was a car too bill filers
12298,no no he cant be dead hes still inside that ship
12299,this panel here
12300,yeah the particles are accelerated round and round the cyclotron in an ever increasing electromagnetic field eventually we hope to have controlled acceleration up to the speed of light now once beyond that point the particles will be travelling in the fourth dimension i will be able to begin my experiments with the nature of time itself
12301,and i suppose you cant remember
12302,how convenient
12303,no doctor i simply wont hear of it
12304,youre asking me to risk fifty million pounds worth of equipment
12305,oh no its far too hazardous the whole damn lot could go up
12306,not a thing damn it it should show some response to something
12307,go on say it
12308,i told you so
12309,i thought you said it was us
12310,well if we  if we can bypass the malfunction and your light accelerators compatible it might work
12311,yes i suppose youre right ill see what i can do
12312,i am master you will obey me you will obey me      filer 2
12313,no doc
12314,boy am i glad thats not me in there
12315,yeah quite sure
12316,now
12317,axonite the copying molecule
12318,yes but i still dont see
12319,he is sure is or was until he escaped
12320,well according to the master theyre some kind of scavenger you know no planet nothing
12321,apart from axonite copying things
12322,brigadier i already have
12323,unfortunately i have my orders
12324,you have a top priority message to send to the united nations i will tell you what to say
12325,oh you stupid quack
12326,doctor i cant move
12327,right sir come on      axon man
12328,right release my men theyll help you search weve got to find them
12329,oh no but what does he think hes doing© what a botchup     axon man
12330,i refuse to align myself to this cosmic bacteria of yours  axon man
12331,large quantities of axonite are available for immediate distribution perhaps you could show me the extent of the operation     axos
12332,yes     axos

12460,er look make yourself at home thats the entertainment console i shant be long
12461,im captain dent in charge of this survey team a great pleasure to meet you mister
12462,well doctor it seems a most unfortunate mistake has been made
12463,its not necessarily out mistake as things have turned out this planet doesnt seem very suitable for colonisation
12464,i understand its still infested with hostile animal life
12465,i admire your optimism is it shared by the other colonists
12466,i see then youre not really concerned
12467,the colonists shouldnt be here my corporation has been assigned the mineral rights on this planet our preliminary survey indicates a very rich concentration of duralinium you know how the earth needs that mineral
12468,whats good for imc is good for earth there are one hundred thousand million people back on earth and they desperately need all the minerals we can find
12469,thats not my concern minerals are needed its my job to find them
12470,i can see were on opposite sides doctor
12471,youd better break the sad news morgan
12472,my names morgan

12478,well were just as interested in these creatures as you are who knows they might attack us too
12479,get out of the way
12480,if you get on our blacklist youll never work again for anyone youre up to your ears in debt i checked dont worry about the colonists caldwell just get on with your work and let morgan get on with his
12481,i wanted to see how much damage these creatures can cause
12482,and you say these same marks were found on the two colonists
12483,what do you mean
12484,but these claw marks i mean something made them
12485,you mean with something like this
12486,keep back purely business you understand nothing personal
12487,doctor what happened are you all right

12489,thats a very serious allegation doctor
12490,yes were going to send for an adjudicator
12491,he really tried to kill you
12492,doctor those monsters were real i saw them
12493,this is unbelievable
12494,yes if were still here
12495,were in a middle of a power breakdown jo said that you might be able to fix it
12496,doctor you havent lost the tardis
12497,look doctor the whole life of this colony is in danger now well help you look for your blue box later
12498,but doctor
12499,im really very grateful doctor id better get power out to the outlying domes how long will it keep going
12500,yes norton
12501,doctor theres a message for you from the imc ship
12502,captain dent says he wants to see you
12503,something to do with jo grant
12504,under arrest she was caught attempting to rob this spaceship
12505,you are acquainted with interplanetary laws shes committed a capital offence
12506,when the adjudicator arrives you will withdraw your ridiculous accusations
12507,not here doctor she is rather uncomfortably placed do you know anything of our survey methods
12508,but this is abominable doctor ill go and see captain dent at once
12509,then we must organise a search
12510,well what if he is
12511,winton
12512,imc have still got her
12513,doctor there was nothing else i could do
12514,now look robert ive been chained to a bomb hunted and shot at as far as im concerned the wars already started
12515,come in dome three report to main dome immediately do you read me  colonist
12516,yes caldwell their chief mineralogist
12517,he had a survey tent pitched in the north sector
12518,well why
12519,what do you want
12520,i work for imc
12521,no
12522,look dents just bluffing to scare you into keeping quiet
12523,then youd better stop them the guards will mow them down
12524,what
12525,dont shoot
12526,weve got them outnumbered
12527,now look doctor were going to attack this morning and thats final
12528,oh yes how
12529,and secondly
12530,this in an imc ship there are none of your people in here
12531,im afraid your guards are rather busy captain
12532,shes vanished doctor i cant contact her guard
12533,i think so
12534,never mind the speeches captain order your guards to surrender now
12535,i know where they are doctor ill take you there
12536,quite so
12537,well what do you expect norton killed one
12538,im afraid so
12539,in the early days one or two of our people went down there there were rumours of creatures that lived in the ruins
12540,we dont know they never came back
12541,and get yourself killed or captured too
12542,well you may be able to buy her back
12543,well from time to time they capture someone and trade them for food with luck they should be along soon to offer her back
12544,well you dont have to worry about that weve got plenty of food
12545,all right if youre determined to go on alone tell them ill pay the ransom i think they trust me
12546,you will release my security guards
12547,doctor oh im so pleased to see you i didnt think id see you again
12548,hes probably gone to get the other one
12549,theres some sort of creature that seems to be in charge of them
12550,no not really
12551,well never mind that how are we going to get out of here
12552,buy me back
12553,then what happened to it
12554,thats just what i was thinking come take a look at this
12555,what happened here
12556,more recent too a man being forced through a hatch
12557,now what
12558,thank you doctor
12559,where are they going
12560,they brought us in this way
12561,what is that thing
12562,and you
12563,all intruders in the city must die that is the law
12564,the law must obeyed
12565,i sense that you are a being of superior intelligence and although the creature with you is of no value i will let you both go but remember this if you ever return you will be destroyed
12566,come on doctor this is no time for philosophising
12567,since however the issues are extremely complicated i shall need time to consider my decision this tribunal stands adjourned
12568,my dear doctor i am the adjudicator
12569,what are you doing here anyway did the time lords send you
12570,so youve at last succeeded in escaping from your long exile on earth congratulations what are your plans now
12571,that would be very foolish of you my credentials are immaculate
12572,of course but immaculate may i see your credentials doctor
12573,what no interplanetary travel permit no registration for your tardis no personal identification
12574,without these my dear doctor you do not exist i could have you sent back to earth as a prisoner
12575,im sorry robert believe me i really am sorry
12576,why dont you tell them about the master
12577,well weve got to do something
12578,take cover
12579,it wont do any good doctor they wont listen to you its always the innocent bystander who suffers eventually
12580,winton winton  youve got to stop this
12581,youve made us look like criminals you do realise that dont you
12582,yes i should like to go to the primitive city
12583,my dear doctor how can you possibly know that
12584,can you substantiate these accusations
12585,ah talking of credentials might we see yours
12586,im sorry doctor
12587,doctor whats happening
12588,did you tell them who he really was
12589,and they didnt believe you
12590,where do we find that
12591,i didnt see the masters horse box here
12592,how do we get in
12593,youre giving in
12594,yeah
12595,and admit weve been made fools of well handle this ourselves prepare to go into landing orbit
12596,what is it
12597,do you think hes after that duralaynium stuff like the imc people
12598,doctor look these must be the real adjudicators credentials
12599,arent you going to show those credentials to ashe
12600,doctor please hurry up the master might come back
12601,doctor i cant breathe
12602,well doctor still pursuing burglary eh you know when you stole my dematerialisation circuit i decided to build in a few precautions
12603,the same as i did to you a simple sleep gas mind you i could just have easily used a lethal one
12604,i want to use your services as a guide doctor youre going to take me to the primitive city
12605,thats no concern of yours but you will do what i ask
12606,i just have to press this button on here and miss grants cubicle will immediately be flooded with lethal gas
12607,you will make preparations for lift off immediately
12608,doctor i hope youre not going to try anything clever remember miss grant
12609,is that what youre frightened of doctor savages hurling stones and spears
12610,maybe lets be on our way shall we
12611,in that case wed better walk
12612,well caldwell weve got a job to do
12613,is it how do we get in
12614,someones trying to rescue miss grant
12615,i warned you doctor
12616,why doesnt he answer
12617,no wait what is this place
12618,yes
12619,thats absolutely fascinating the whole story is here
12620,well this city was once the center of a great civilisation
12621,by genetic engineering they developed a superrace that priest we saw must be a remnant of it
12622,well not exactly i knew it already the files of the time lords are very comprehensive
12623,well it seemed an awful pity not to make use of it you know but of course thats typical of the high council of the time lords know everything do nothing
12624,well this superrace developed a doomsday weapon it was never used
12625,who knows maybe it was due to a degeneration of the life strain
12626,so it would seem
12627,not unless its absolutely necessary well dont you see doctor the very threat of its use could hold the galaxy to ransom
12628,doctor you underrate me
12629,and i told them the motors were all right
12630,look that doctor is the sun that gives life to the planet earth that you hold in such affection
12631,then you will know that one day that sun will burn through to its core and explode
12632,well with this weapon i could make that happen now
12633,you know the crab nebula
12634,i think its this way lets try
12635,doctor why dont you come in with me were both time lords were both renegades we could be masters of the galaxy think of it doctor absolute power power for good why you could reign benevolently you could end wars suffering disease we could save the universe
12636,of course
12637,why why look at this look at all those planetary systems doctor we could rule them all
12638,the point is that one must rule or serve thats a basic law of life why do you hesitate doctor surely its not loyalty to the time lords who exiled you on one insignificant planet
12639,whats happening
12640,what is it
12641,i want to restore this city and this planet to their former glory
12642,you have here a wonderful weapon why with it you could bring good and peace to every world in the galaxy
12643,this planet of yours could be the centre of a mighty empire the greatest that the cosmos has ever known
12644,once the weapon was built our race began to decay the radiation from the weapons power source poisoned the soil of our planet
12645,there is a selfdestructor mechanism you will please operate it
12646,you must leave at once or you will be destroyed with the city
12647,come on do you want to die with them
12648,looking for you
12649,give him that map
12650,the master hes gone
12651,yes but it took off and blew up i saw it
12652,the rocket had to take off it was the only way that we could get imc out of the way
12653,in one of the dwellings a few miles from the dome there was a lot of stuff there that the primitives have stolen
12654,doctor what is it
12655,hes talking as if wed never been away
12656,what are you two talking about
12657,but it really is the dawning of the age of aquarius
12658,well that means the occult well you know the supernatural and all that magic bit
12659,well how do you know theres nothing in it
12660,yes but suppose something was to happen and nobody knew the explanation well nobody in the world in the universe well that would be magic wouldnt it
12661,doctor look
12662,i know theres a good explanation for all this but i just cant think of it for the moment
12663,magic
12664,no
12665,thats not fair
12666,i dont know i suppose you did it
12667,how infuriating can you get well it doesnt prove anything
12668,you coming doctor
12669,well to see that programme
12670,oh i wouldnt miss it for the world very exciting forecasts of doom and disaster if anyone disturbs the burial chamber

12738,youre being deliberately obtuse were dealing with the supernatural the occult magic
12739,magic
12740,and how can we stop it without knowing what it is
12741,well that settles it the perimeter of this thing is an unbroken circle ten miles     brigadier

12748,oh you could go on all day and all night showing us pretty pictures i mean horns have been a symbol of power ever since
12749,do you mean like the axons and the cybermen

12751,sixty thousand light years away on the other side of the galaxy
12752,yes meeting to order please thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen well now it seemed to me that we ought to get together and discuss the situation before it gets out of hand now it seems that the vicar here has had a few thoughts on the subject so ive asked him to put in a word mister magister
12753,hmm sorry could you say that again i didnt quite follow you
12754,youre the doctor
12755,i see so all weve got to deal with is something which is either too small to see or thirty feet tall can incinerate you or freeze you to death turns stone images into homicidal monsters and looks like the very devil
12756,well i still dont get it i mean whats the creature doing here i mean why did they ever come
12757,yes and you say they come from another planet well then whats all this jazz about witchcraft and covens and so on
12758,then these creatures are linked with the black arts they are evil

12881,yes well this particular squabble looks like ending up in a third world war the chinese delegation have refused to attend without them the conference cant even begin now styles is flying to peking in a few hours theres just a chance that he can persuade them to change their minds
12882,he suddenly started behaving rather oddly seemed to think that someone was trying to assassinate him
12883,he said somebody attacked him and vanished
12884,then i must have opened them
12885,sergeant

12915,we must go quietly
12916,well theyre criminals they must be
12917,well arent you© they tried to kill you and me
12918,well ive been trying but ropes are too tight

12936,doctor come back at once              boaz
12937,we warned you
12938,this may come as a shock to you but youve just travelled two hundred years through time
12939,then youre a fool to have let yourself be brought here
12940,i told you shes probably dead
12941,come on anat
12942,well perhaps now youll tell us who you are
12943,youre a spy
12944,im asking the questions i repeat youre a spy
12945,careful our friends here dont get much fun
12946,all right i want to know what youre doing here
12947,then why is he being treated in this fashion© my dear doctor i cannot apologise enough i am the controller of this region youre a very elusive fellow you know ive had quite a job in tracking you down
12948,ive been looking forward to meeting you you are an honoured guest of our government
12949,im sorry if the ogrons were a little uncivilised it was all a misunderstanding i do assure you the whole thing has been sorted out now make sure that the doctor is taken immediately to the guest room at regional control
12950,a very great friend of yours is waiting for you there
12951,yes
12952,it seems a long time ago
12953,naturally you prefer the twentieth century doctor after all it is your own time
12954,well i quite like it here i must say everyones been most kind
12955,that was a simple mistake doctor i assure you you must not jump to conclusions
12956,that was not a factory doctor
12957,a rehabilitation centre a rehabilitation centre for hardened criminals
12958,there will always be people who need discipline doctor
12959,i can assure you that this planet has never been more efficiently more economically run people have never been happier or more prosperous
12960,youre being a bit unreasonable doctor
12961,well look the controller wants to help you
12962,youre not on the side of the criminals surely© they wanted to kill you
12963,exactly they are simply guard dogs they just do what i tell them
12964,that is not what i was saying
12965,you have no right to say that
12966,you shouldnt have spoken to him like that you dont know the whole picture
12967,we will use the mind analysis machine
12968,yes ready when you are
12969,help help help
12970,the daleks have discovered the secret of time travel we have invaded earth again we have changed the pattern of history
12971,come time is short
12972,i am trying to help him ive already save his life
12973,look if you do not tell me everything that manager knew about these criminals where they operate from what their plans are then the daleks will destroy both of you
12974,not if you cooperate with them
12975,they can be reasonable
12976,i am a senior government official
12977,there was no power on earth to stop them
12978,they chose a few humans to help them get things going again to organise the remaining population my family have been controllers in this area for three generations
12979,we have helped make things better for the others we have gained concessions i have saved lives
12980,no one can fight against the daleks
12981,if you dont give me the information i need there is nothing i can do to help you
12982,as for you my friend
12983,you dont know how much blood there is on his hands
12984,he helped the daleks hes worked for them
12985,what to you has not yet happened is to us history
12986,oh yeah he pretended to be working for peace but really he just wanted power for himself
12987,but if this true sir reginald styles must be completely round the bend
12988,now somehow the daleks found what we were doing and they sent ogrons back into your time after us and attacked one of our men
12989,yes we fixed on the tunnel as a place that was stable in your time and in ours we used it as a transfer point well you know the rest
12990,well you told us yourself youre an old enemy of the daleks
12991,then you will help us to beat them
12992,well you can succeed where weve failed doctor we want you to go back into your own time and kill styles
12993,no were asking you to kill one man and prevent millions more dying
12994,weve told you how it happened
12995,i still cant believe that sir reginald styles is a ruthless murderer
12996,anat
12997,the usual battle gear radio disintegrators
12998,only a few charges of dalekanium
12999,its a highly effective type of explosive we stole the formula from the daleks
13000,well obviously but who© shura
13001,its possible i suppose
13002,right well give you covering fire just in case
13003,it cant be done
13004,if only i could be sure
13005,you saved my life you could have let them kill me go quickly
13006,look youre supposed to be in charge of security kindly get on with your job and leave me to get on with mine
13007,do as he says look there isnt much time
13008,arranging this conference was an almost impossible task it is no exaggeration to say that the peace of the world depends on its success i will not jeopardise that success now
13009,get out of here unless you want to die too i must kill styles to prevent the war
13010,daleks© youre lying
13011,you dont understand thats dalekanium its the only thing thats effective against the daleks
13012,this stuffs too unstable there just isnt time this is something that i must do myself now get out
13013,greyhound to trap one greyhound to trap one do you read me© over greyhound to
13014,doctor are you sure that
13015,dont worry we all know what will happen if we fail
13016,so the spirit of aggedor has risen again the ancient curse of peladon will be fulfilled
13017,and about time too
13018,impatient© look im all dolled up im all dolled up for a night out on the town with mike yates when you talk me into a joyride in this thing
13019,well weve been simply ages look im going to be very late so if youll just open the doors and let me out ill be
13020,precisely nothing
13021,i might have expected it the tardis always is
13022,yes
13023,its smashed to pieces
13024,oo looks a bit doomy
13025,but im not exactly dressed for mountaineering
13026,no thanks anyway we dont even know where we are
13027,its no good i cant go any further i nearly broke my neck coming up this far
13028,okay    jo
13029,over here come on
13030,then make sure that our mission is not endangered
13031,ive never seen anything like it before
13032,then i will talk to them convince them summon the delegates now hepesh
13033,oh no its blocked up
13034,i am delegate arcturus you are late
13035,that will be arranged i am hepesh high priest of peladon
13036,protocol demands that you should present formally your credentials to king peladon hand them to me
13037,doctor i do not deal through intermediaries kindly present us to our royal host
13038,ah as on my planet you still retain the aristocratic process
13039,chairman delegate from earth we are not here to indulge in social diplomacy
13040,we are here to consider admitting this somewhat primitive planet into the galactic federation
13041,unfortunately the success of our mission in threatened violently
13042,are of no concern
13043,then perhaps we should withdraw to the delegates conference room
13044,thank you that would be very nice see you later
13045,you have saved our lives thank you
13046,aggedor has been merciful we must give thanks that you have all been spared
13047,yes indeed
13048,it is a sign of aggedors anger his ghost walks amongst us
13049,to the unbeliever all signs are as dust in the wind
13050,then you must teach peladon without help we will never raise ourselves from the dark ages do not desert us now
13051,if we remain we put ourselves at risk
13052,of course
13053,there is no plot i am being completely honest with you please stay and help me to help my people
13054,hmm but they say theyre here for the same reason as the other delegates peace
13055,i still think youre jumping to conclusions
13056,oh
13057,oh come on you love all that chairman delegate stuff admit it
13058,well whoever took it must have been the one who tried to kill arcturus
13059,so if we could find it look i can search all the delegates rooms
13060,but if we had some real evidence
13061,someone has disconnected a vital part of his life support system im trying to save him now please leave me alone
13062,this is the work of aggedor
13063,what are you suggesting© i reject the accusation
13064,i cannot remember
13065,in the hands of the earth princess
13066,sacrilege seize him grun you have defiled the inner sanctum of the holy temple of aggedor your mind your word your being all are evil
13067,take him before the king
13068,only the aliens death can purify the holy temple of aggedor
13069,he is lying your majesty there are no such passages
13070,you will be held captive in your room until dawn then you will lowered into the pit beneath the citadel where you will engage in combat to the death with the kings champion grun
13071,the door of your room will be left open there will be no one there to stand in your way
13072,there lies your route to freedom take it leave our planet and live
13073,a large blue box was found on the lower slope of the mountain
13074,it is being brought to the citadel
13075,she will be allowed to leave with you
13076,i do not mean to have this planet destroyed in retaliation by the spaceships of the federation
13077,because im afraid
13078,that is not true i know the federations real intent
13079,no theyll exploit us for our minerals enslave us with their machines corrupt us with their technology the face of peladon will be changed the past swept away and everything that i know and value will have gone
13080,i would rather be a cave dweller and free
13081,we need aggedor
13082,we do not stand alone
13083,my lord
13084,if that is so hepesh and this planet will have much to answer for
13085,hang on doctor
13086,ill scare him off
13087,get back go on back
13088,im sorry i thought you were going to be killed i only wanted to help you
13089,a coward admitting his guilt his life is forfeit he will be hunted and killed like an animal
13090,wait
13091,he commits ever greater sacrilege no one sees aggedor and lives
13092,you lie the spirit of aggedor will take his revenge his manifestation is holy
13093,then produce this creature if you can
13094,there are no tunnels your majesty
13095,no this is merely a device to postpone the trial by combat
13096,grun
13097,his planet lacks mineral deposits peladon has them in abundance
13098,extremely unethical fortunately the scheme has been foiled so all is well
13099,yes arcturus is dead
13100,yes mars and the world of arcturus are old enemies that would mean war
13101,the federation will be ripped there will be interplanetary conflict
13102,my lord
13103,but it would be a break with all precedent i cant persuade myself that interference of this kind is justified
13104,it would be different if there were precedents for such a situation but there arent we must consider all possibilities we must not be rash
13105,but he cant just accuse the ice warriors of murder there were witnesses ssorg had to shoot him to save your life
13106,you playing the grand ambassador and centauri upstaging everybody and peladon acting like a wet fish i think its about time that
13107,your forthcoming marriage with king peladon
13108,h what hepesh© and a soldier© how many soldiers© many© if he takes charge of the citadel we dont stand much chance
13109,you have become a stranger to me peladon return to the ancient ways of our people and you will live on our beloved king if not the royal line of peladon must meet an ignoble end
13110,my men hold king peladon prisoner if i do not return will all of you immediately he will die follow me
13111,i am not holding you i do not want you either as guests or as hostages i know the retribution this planet would suffer if anything happened to any of you therefore go in peace tell your masters peladon wants nothing of their federation but go now
13112,doctor
13113,do not listen to the alien i am your high priest
13114,aggedor aggedor kill him

13332,well good luck doctor
13333,everything okay sir
13334,are you all right doctor
13335,this is our planet my people ruled the earth when man was only an ape
13336,our astronomers predicted that a great catastrophe would end all life on the face of the earth
13337,you know our history
13338,we shall destroy man and reclaim the planet already we have begun to sink his ships
13339,the submarine we have captured it
13340,there are many thousands of our people in hibernation in this base we have other colonies hidden all round the world we shall be the victors in the war against mankind
13341,that would be impossible
13342,and man would agree to that
13343,i will consider what you have said
13344,make this to ministry of defence navy special task force will be in position at thirteen fifty thats all thank you
13345,the master is our friend
13346,i do not i came here to help you revive your people
13347,and i can now repair it for you
13348,is that true
13349,you see he admits it man is weak your conquest will be easy
13350,you will negotiate a truce between my people and the humans
13351,would you like to try sir
13352,who the blazes are you
13353,still in the submarine
13354,yes
13355,in a kind of undersea harbour
13356,i think so yes
13357,here cant you see hes not well
13358,maximum revs sir
13359,they cannot escape us now
13360,were still halfway in the cave sir we could blow ourselves up
13361,increase the force field
13362,its of no importance before they can attack us we shall attack them
13363,well well well so the heroes have returned
13364,im the idiot youve just been talking about absolutely splendid lunch old man
13365,i did
13366,our duty is to destroy the queens enemies dont you know your national anthem confound their politics frustrate their knavish tricks
13367,peace huh what when theyve been attacking our shipping and heaven alone knows what i think youve got it all wrong old man seek and destroy thats what you chaps say isnt it
13368,im going to get on to the minister and im going to ask him to seek approval for an immediate attack with nuclear weapons
13369,oh come come doctor you speak as if these creatures are human were not going to hand over the world to a lot of lizards you know
13370,oh come really doctor
13371,well you didnt get very far last time did you
13372,look you can actually communicate with these creatures
13373,and youd be willing to undertake the preliminary negotiations yourself
13374,doctor youre not thinking of going down there again
13375,but doctor its far too dangerous
13376,yes but i must say that i agree with miss grant
13377,doctor do you think youre doing the right thing
13378,doctor
13379,as you know our friends here have underground and underwater bases all over the world well i propose to reactivate them
13380,er not yet no but i can with your help
13381,now then doctor my problem is this during millions of years of hibernation the reactivation machinery has deteriorated i now find it necessary to build a trigger mechanism for it
13382,well by constructing a sonar device analogous to the laser with this i can not only pinpoint and revive the base by the sea fort but every other base in the world
13383,you know itll work with your cooperation all the equipment we need is here
13384,ive drawn up some preliminary plans here there
13385,why what is the matter
13386,there you are
13387,and you think you can correct this fault
13388,doctor
13389,oh allow me

13391,but what about the guards
13392,okay
13393,well doctor
13394,its all right i can fly one come on            master

13402,right ill stay with this bloke
13403,a mistake

13405,we shall destroy man and reclaim the planet
13406,nothing
13407,allow me doctor we dont want any accidents this time
13408,look i demand you take me back to your chief immediately
13409,once they see that the device works properly theyll release me
13410,you did what you realise what will happen
13411,well therell be a massive reverse feedback into their whole power system
13412,guards guards come back you must release me i must talk to your chief let me out were all in danger let me out

13459,this way sir
13460,doctor
13461,you can see the planet in daylight now
13462,its not like our earth is it its all grey and misty
13463,it cant be
13464,really
13465,morning
13466,ive seen your statements what is it you want as briefly as possible
13467,who sent you
13468,the council you mean
13469,the council has no further interest in solos
13470,just er when did you leave doctor
13471,hes lying hes got no pass
13472,there have been no shuttles no departures from earth no arrivals on skybase in weeks
13473,let him speak why are you here
13474,is this some kind of joke who is it for what is it anyway
13475,then open it
13476,open it
13477,stand back
13478,they were found with the mutt they must be saboteurs
13479,what are you some sort of special agent for the council sent to check on me
13480,i shall find out
13481,yes good varan    man
13482,well it always impresses them on solos
13483,independence oh yeah the sooner the better lets get off and home plenty to sort out there
13484,what the
13485,pity he was rather sweet
13486,mmm
13487,where do you think youre going
13488,not without a pass sorry sir
13489,nobody in without a pass sir
13490,sorry sir that mutt extra security all over
13491,open it up please sir
13492,out of my way overlord
13493,ill get him doctor
13494,now you fool shoot
13495,not for you doctor for your friend they have escaped on to the surface of solos
13496,still without a mask but never fear doctor we shall find her or her body
13497,during the hours of daylight no human can survive on solos without an oxymask the soil contains a nitrogen isotope unknown on earth the ultraviolet rays of the sun cause a kind of poisonous mist
13498,i give your friend an hour possibly less depending on how fast theyre travelling i could of course step up the search
13499,or i could call off the search altogether let them escape
13500,i can do as i please doctor and since the unfortunate assassination of the administrator solos is under martial law my law
13501,that depends on you doctor
13502,well i thought you said this box was intended for ky
13503,then i shall want to know whats in it before he does
13504,then i shall be forced to recall my men doctor were stretched very thin on skybase so many demands on our resources you know
13505,calling solos intensify the search
13506,the girl must not be harmed
13507,well
13508,adequate what do you mean adequate its the finest laboratory its possible to build
13509,what the blazes is going on in here oh its you marshal my apologies but there was tampering with one of the circuits
13510,ill send some medics down to pick him up
13511,thaesium doctor this planet is one of the richest fuel sources in the galaxy or it used to be
13512,more or less
13513,thats my problem not yours
13514,such as
13515,was doctor it is doctor is it
13516,i think that this whole thing is a senseless waste of time particle reversal nobody has ever achieved it
13517,what do you expect to happen
13518,rubbish
13519,how
13520,but it worked
13521,but theoretically its impossible
13522,not clearly but the process
13523,is varan here
13524,jaeger have you seen him varan the mutt
13525,so long as that mutt stays alive hes a menace to everybody on this skybase he was behind the assassination plot with ky
13526,sir
13527,mmm
13528,seed propagation earth crops for solos varan varan its no use me old son lets get it over with
13529,its the only way
13530,varan is no mutt overlord i am a warrior and i fight like a warrior
13531,the marshal has murdered my son
13532,you mean his nibs fixed up the whole thing had the administrator done in and then swung the blame on the natives
13533,i see and if theres independence the marshals out of a job
13534,so what do we do
13535,hes been dealt with sir
13536,these mutts are a bigger menace than you realise doctor as no doubt miss grant will tell you
13537,shes receiving oxygen treatment in a day or so
13538,possibly longer she was in pretty poor shape when cotton found her
13539,ky left her to die doctor the whole planet will remain under marshal law until the fuss of the assassination dies down meanwhile doctor professor jaeger could use you on a project of some urgency it will pass the time
13540,what i propose to do is to bombard these layers of the atmosphere with ionisation rockets at these points this will provide a barrier against the ultraviolet rays which create the poison mist
13541,but these arent military rockets
13542,i cant understand your concern doctor this planet as it stands is no longer of any use unless we make the atmosphere breathable
13543,earth is fighting for its survival the sideeffects are of no importance
13544,perhaps you have an alternative suggestion
13545,particle reversal no doubt your little forte
13546,the question is doctor can it be done
13547,sir
13548,ive been chatting with stubbs hes a kind of mate of mine
13549,about varan and about miss grant
13550,thats it sir you cant we didnt find her
13551,as far as we know shes still with ky
13552,all the guards have orders to stop you leaving this section
13553,afraid not sir
13554,yes it why sir
13555,sheer chaos
13556,you could slip down to solos in the confusion
13557,i can try
13558,oh yes sir sorry sir maybe he changed his mind sir
13559,good
13560,surely youll overload the whole power supply
13561,yes
13562,ky is my enemy i will destroy him and you too overlord
13563,firestorms
13564,it is the wrath of the gods
13565,you have no mask when the sun rises you will not be able to breathe the air on solos no earthman can
13566,for a while stubbs and there we shall kill three birds with one stone mutts varan and the doctor
13567,you saw such creatures are evil diseased
13568,then you must find him alone doctor varan goes no further
13569,no no
13570,varan fears nothing
13571,no listen to me i am ky you know me my people i come to find refuge not to harm you
13572,why are you here varan did your overlord masters send you to hunt me
13573,so you are the doctor the friend of miss grant
13574,i took her to a place of safety when we were attacked
13575,why did you come here
13576,varan is right how can these help us in our struggle weapons are what we need
13577,i have seen such signs
13578,why i cannot it is the language of the old ones no one remembers all our culture has been destroyed by the overlords
13579,signs like these are carved in rocks all over solos but no one knows no one remembers as far as we are concerned doctor they are meaningless squiggles
13580,why indeed come if we stay here they will surely attack again
13581,you are fools
13582,is this the way to fight the overlords to stay here and be killed by mutts if you will not fight varan will
13583,he will go back to his village and he and his men for all their valour will be wiped out swords are no use against the overlord
13584,this way doctor
13585,there was a man called er sondergaard a man of learning from earth he came to study our culture
13586,after a while he disappeared oh it was all arranged by the overlords
13587,then theyll die anyway
13588,well i left her here perhaps she became frightened ran off in panic
13589,no
13590,but she must be here
13591,if the torches last and they dont attack
13592,theyre watching us all the time
13593,i feel it myself
13594,a sensation an awareness of being drawn here this is a warm safe place a centre a sort of instinct
13595,overlords we must abandon the search they will trap us here  stubbs
13596,lets try this way
13597,doctor
13598,run doctor
13599,a passageway full of light even the rocks were glowing i remember walking towards the light
13600,and then there was this noise in my head i couldnt hear i couldnt see properly it was then i started to get dizzy
13601,there was a figure a silvery figure
13602,i dont know
13603,im sorry doctor i fainted
13604,id better tell his nibs whats going on
13605,better off on skybase than in here youll have to hurry old son the attacks due to start any minute now
13606,mmm they go there to die they have the old idea of the elephants graveyard right should be any moment now
13607,thats it the thing i saw no dont shoot look
13608,wheres he talking us anyway
13609,radiation
13610,and who did this to my people who hunted them down like wild animals the overlords
13611,aggression yes and who were the first aggressors
13612,him why does he hide in these caves to experiment on my people
13613,well he has my sympathies do you think ive chosen to live here to work with this primitive equipment i was young ambitious i hoped to make many great discoveries here and my first was that solos had become a slave colony i was unwise enough to try to inform earth control the marshal intercepted my report i was lucky to escape with my life i managed to reach the caves ive been here ever since
13614,they did we were all outcasts we helped one another once they stole food for me and clothing
13615,who knows perhaps theyre right strange things are happening on solos doctor oh not just to the people but to the plants the soil the atmosphere even the weather the whole flora and fauna of solos
13616,exactly and my belief is this at first the changes were natural but now professor jaegers experiments have accelerated the changes and something is seriously wrong
13617,extraordinary this wonderful doctor marvellous
13618,all over solos you see the same symbols you see
13619,well i can try i have approximate translations for many of the basic symbols one might call this the solonian book of genesis the lost tablets this doctor is the story of how solonian civilisation began
13620,doctor that wasnt a blast pack or a grenade that was the mountain itself the tunnels are falling in now if we stay here were finished all of us
13621,doctor
13622,youre not going to stay here doctor
13623,yes i know but you heard what he said the whole mountain is caving in
13624,but doctor you cant
13625,now then this pattern repeated is almost the same and this is the solonian sun symbol
13626,well er a cycle perhaps representing some form of chemical process
13627,well life
13628,lets hope so
13629,come on better try this way
13630,but solos has no seasons it does not tilt on its axis relative to its sun
13631,but solos takes two thousand years to go round its sun we know that
13632,possibly
13633,yes but what about these spirals theyre like small sun symbols
13634,the radiation cave but ive only one suit if you spend any time in there without one doctor you will die any man would
13635,this section here
13636,that way
13637,yes
13638,oh yes what about you doctor the intensity in there is far greater
13639,your weapons overlords
13640,there is no cure for this
13641,so its not a sickness
13642,and weve yet to see the final metamorphosis
13643,the tablets led us to the crystal
13644,maybe that the cellular change is only affected by the particular radiation in the crystal
13645,thats impossible
13646,the equipment heres too primitive for crystallography theres only one place
13647,in there quick  man
13648,very touching guards bring them
13649,or of varan
13650,whats happening here
13651,its no good i cant youll have to leave me
13652,youve got to get to that laboratory on skybase doctor you stand a better chance on your own ill be all right ill rest here for a while and then go back to the caves ill be safe there now go please
13653,drive him this way remember keep the pressure on i want the doctor here in one piece right get on with it
13654,hes heading for the transfer station after him come on move it
13655,doctor
13656,and the other thing
13657,as youre no doubt aware jaegers made a complete hash of my plan to make the planet habitable he seemed to think you could help him put it right
13658,then you will live both of you
13659,oh come now doctor surely you can guess
13660,then why the delay its not just their lives the whole planet is at stake
13661,oh one more thing your superior will be arriving shortly
13662,yes earth control has seen fit to have my project investigated i want my reforms to have their approval you and your friends here will confirm the necessity of stern measures outbreaks of plague and rebellion must be controlled dont you agree
13663,ah here you are
13664,this is the situation as far as we can tell the centres of crystal contamination have already started to spread and in some cases link up
13665,all the living organisms seem to be affected
13666,it wasnt my decision doctor
13667,well theres only one
13668,yes but you cant use that
13669,i thought you were going to use the particle reversal
13670,oh i see er why
13671,i shall have to get the marshals authority
13672,its not going to be easy it means isolating skybase
13673,ready to isolate transfer macrovisor
13674,now miss grant perhaps youd be good enough to come with me
13675,no no not sick we know now you are supposed to become like this you are supposed to change now listen to me please but the overlords experiments with the air of solos have made the mutation rate made the change happen wrongly do you follow me the change can be put right we know that now the mutation rate can be made to go as it was meant to but you must help me you must help me find the doctor will you come with me and find him to save your people
13676,you have full power now
13677,planet surface no longer contaminated
13678,exactly as it was before my rockets landed
13679,not so doctor youll continue to operate this device for me until solos has an atmosphere breathable by humans and only by humans
13680,well doctor  hyperion
13681,how much longer am i supposed to run skybase with my entire crew suspended from duty i refuse to be treated like a like a
13682,should we
13683,mutts
13684,mutts you say
13685,i see you are a doctor i take it
13686,qualified in
13687,ah well doctor do you agree with the marshals diagnosis that the condition of these mutts was incurable
13688,what is going on here who are these people
13689,lies all lies
13690,they would have died anyway
13691,it was my duty my duty to save solos from contamination
13692,can you prove your assertion doctor perhaps we could see these tablets you mention
13693,well
13694,ah yes you mentioned him in your report where is professor sondergaard now
13695,i see and your other proofs the mutations are not harmful
13696,he can prove nothing
13697,where where is your proof
13698,what is the meaning of this interruption who is this man
13699,doctor i dont understand whats happening here
13700,doctor the crystal the one you found in the cave you have it still
13701,but that would take hours
13702,well quickly doctor
13703,well theres thaesium radiation in the chamber where they took us cotton told me
13704,get away from that machine doctor guards take that girl and sondergaard to the radiation chamber
13705,i am once more in full control of skybase doctor a fact you would do well to remember
13706,oh theyll be room for them you should be grateful to help me well begin a new earth the centre of a new empire
13707,oh no doctor i told you madmen lose ive won solos is mine have you finished your work
13708,are we ready
13709,very well
13710,hurry doctor hurry
13711,wait
13712,i cant its overloading
13713,doctor you have destroyed my dreams ill destroy you    ky
13714,but what about the others the mutants we saw in the caves
13715,i take it you will be returning in hyperion with me i still require a full account of your involvement in this affair
13716,who me no im fine now honestly i didnt feel too good earlier but
13717,i have

13727,the next time who turns up
13728,youre joking of course
13729,it just shows you dont listen to a word i say doesnt it now yes here we are new eruptions in the thera group of islands somewhere off greece

13731,no what crystal look i know im exceedingly dim but would you mind explaining
13732,doctor
13733,come and take a look

13738,well nothing i was just saying to mike
13739,well thats what it says in the paper
13740,yes here we are believed by many modern historians to be all that remains of platos metropolis of atlantis
13741,its only a legend though isnt it
13742,what now
13743,doctor its the brigadier
13744,in any case doctor every section of unit now has the search for the master written into standing orders
13745,priority a one actually
13746,danger of what for heavens sake
13747,right wed better be on our way to the newton institute ready doctor
13748,oh shall i go
13749,well its the er the trans
13750,you know doctor youre quite the most infuriating man ive ever met ive asked you at least a million times what is it
13751,oh i see
13752,well it er
13753,it er detects disturbances in a time field
13754,its a tardis snifferouter
13755,bingo
13756,well done
13757,its a bit out on distance though it says the tardis is only a foot away
13758,oh theyre larger than ours
13759,doctor
13760,i think you must have left something on in the tardis
13761,well its started again
13762,unless what
13763,weve done it weve done it weve done it weve done it weve done it weve done it weve done it weve done it weve done it

13771,wootton well thats where the brigadier and sergeant benton are
13772,two oclock
13773,doctor slow down its not safe to drive so quickly please
13774,but why didnt i go through the windscreen
13775,its working again

13805,well try me
13806,ive lived with the concept for months
13807,you have
13808,are you saying that kronos is one of these creatures
13809,but kronos was a greek legend he was the titan who ate his children wasnt he
13810,are you trying to tell us that the classical gods are real
13811,you mean like the legend of kronos
13812,you mean that that crystal is the original the actual crystal from atlantis
13813,danger to us you mean doctor or to the whole world
13814,thats better now you go along there and carry along with your telephoning and let me get on with my sums you know its a long time since i came across a hypnotic subject who turned out to be as good as you are its just like old times
13815,yes but you said yourself it picks up all time field disturbances
13816,well what is it doctor
13817,but it did
13818,oh yes sure what for instance
13819,right
13820,doctor doctor the crystals glowing
13821,doctor stuart was
13822,if you say so doctor
13823,its fixed down
13824,well i cant shift it
13825,but then where is the original one
13826,doctor its jo she says stuart hydes coming to hes in a bit of a state it seems
13827,right
13828,it was just after the cup and saucer appeared i was about to switch off when it happened
13829,like a tongue of flame all my body was on fire all my life all my energy was being sucked out of me
13830,because thats who it was
13831,no i just knew
13832,but what is kronos or should i say who
13833,nothing else until i woke up here doc am i really an old man is there nothing you can do or am i stuck like this
13834,but thats it from this seal i can learn the true constants kronos is in my power at last
13835,comparative ratios remain constant throughout time if you have nothing intelligent to say do please keep quiet right now we switch on
13836,right what are we waiting for benton doctor on the double females stay under cover right miss grant
13837,doctor look
13838,well well well so the pet dog does obey him master eh right you stay in your kennel until i have need of you
13839,what what what on earth doctor will you please kindly explain in
13840,the guardian is a person no longer a thing a creature too horrible to imagine half man half beast come
13841,all right doctor go on what next having picked us all up by the scruff of the neck and bundled us all in here what do you propose to do with us
13842,i seem to have heard that before
13843,this isnt a picnic one moment youre talking about the entire universe blowing up and the next youre going on about tea doctor whats happening
13844,nothing of the sort miss grant
13845,and all because of this tomtit gadget
13846,oh a gap between the now and the now as sergeant benton put it
13847,you mean even leaving kronos and the crystal right out of it
13848,marmalade sandwich
13849,well why werent we affected when we were actually working the machine i mean we werent slowed down
13850,well im dashed if i do doctor what are you doing
13851,where do you think atlantis of course
13852,fair enough why dont we get on with it
13853,how about this
13854,moroccan burgundy for instance
13855,there we are
13856,oh remarkable efficiency still on the corkscrew
13857,doctor i must insist what are you up to
13858,the fire is dying you are indeed the master
13859,and whats that meant to be
13860,you mean its just a ridiculous piece of modern art
13861,of course it is ruth you should have seen that at a glance
13862,just as i thought doctor please stop this silly game at once
13863,whats up
13864,bad luck doc have a cup of tea and drown your sorrows
13865,but what does it do i mean how does it actually affect the masters plans
13866,oh
13867,all right doctor you tell me whats going on
13868,so why dont we get over there and stop him
13869,and thats stuck in the mud being battered by a load of roundheads
13870,full of old world charm isnt he
13871,yeah but its coming from the sky
13872,theres something wrong with the engine
13873,well listen theres a funny noise
13874,whats up
13875,it cant be
13876,what
13877,yates that thing is a bomb and its on its way to you over  yates
13878,an ambulance is on its way
13879,sorry about the tardis doctor
13880,my power is greater than your imagination can encompass you just remember that your only interest at the moment is to realise that atlantis awaits us now test the power levels good just a few minutes recycling and we shall be ready to leave
13881,mmm its fading again
13882,yes doctor
13883,right sergeant get the doctors machine loaded up
13884,bye
13885,well make contact as soon as possible
13886,we
13887,no
13888,the tardis looks different
13889,ive been in the tardis with you before
13890,shall i take your coat
13891,yeah im coming
13892,yeah
13893,yeah
13894,time ram
13895,but thats impossible
13896,whumph
13897,it is my job remember
13898,londoners
13899,how longs it going to take us to get there
13900,what your mood
13901,you talk as if she was alive
13902,look
13903,his tardis is inside ours instead of well the other way round
13904,i dont get it
13905,yes but his is inside yours
13906,well what are we going to do now
13907,er i wonder wait

13912,yes and were still trapped in here     master
13913,once he realises that hes talking to himself hell be out here like a shot ah hes realised it at last that took a long time the slow witted fool now you watch he cannot bear not to have the last word
13914,well thats not very nice is it
13915,youre not thinking of going out there are you

13922,i just dont get it
13923,the tardiss are telepathic
13924,youre not going out there
13925,doctor you said yourself it would be suicide to go out there without the protection of the tardis
13926,but that means youll be locked out
13927,i wont do it i will not do it
13928,there you are krasis what did i tell you
13929,i am krasis high priest of the temple of poseidon
13930,oh come doctor must we play games i take it you have something to say to me before i destroy you
13931,of course i am all or nothing literally what a glorious alternative
13932,mmm hm  doctor
13933,he had the bearing of the gods
13934,but you cant just take the tardis wherever you want can you i mean you havent even managed to fix it yet or have you
13935,but not inside it
13936,but krasis i beseech you please give me the chance
13937,you are still alive
13938,they are the enemies of the master and therefore the enemies of our people and our land
13939,you have said nothing to me yet when you find the true words to speak i will listen
13940,strangers are uncommon in our land who are you
13941,this way lady
13942,forgive the roughness of your welcome hippias has all the delicacy of a red necked fisherman
13943,kronos kronos kronos i am the last alive who has known who has seen who remembers with a terror of twisted guts and these fools would have me bring him back
13944,we tried and merely split the smaller crystal from it it cannot be destroyed
13945,you are a philosopher friend
13946,the guardian
13947,a beast a man you can take your choice once he was my friend a fellow councillor a great athlete and just as i longed for the wisdom the years alone could bring so he craved great strength the strength of the bull and a long life in which to use it
13948,so should i but kronos in his blind sport gave him his desire but not only the strength the head of a bull and so he has remained for the past five hundred years or more
13949,please
13950,lord hippias and the high priest have gone into the lair of the guardian followed by the lady jo
13951,seize this intruder
13952,stay back
13953,doctor are you all right
13954,its beautiful but at the same time horrible it gives me a funny feeling
13955,not quite the game is just beginning a pity you will not live to see the end
13956,but i am the king oh didnt he tell you oh hes a jolly fellow our friend krasis he loves a joke
13957,a complete success our little palace revolution
13958,why nothing
13959,for giving me the crystal
13960,tomorrow you will both receive a suitable reward an introduction to the mighty kronos and this time doctor there will be no mistake
13961,you mean like a servant girl and you must learn my love that galleia is a queen
13962,funnily enough they didnt include atlantean chains in my escapology course no its no good doctor what are we going to do
13963,what happens if the master wins
13964,makes it seem so pointless really doesnt it
13965,why
13966,well what do you mean
13967,and he told you the secret well what was it
13968,but what did he say
13969,no

13976,theres so little time so little i tell you the vision of a dying man atlantis was doomed you are a true philosopher the world must be must be saved and you are the one to do it the only one whod have thought it my lovely galleia
13977,brethren of the council my faithful few our troubles are now at an end no longer shall we fret beneath the hand of an old defeated king i shall present to you his holiness the most venerable lord master
13978,greetings to you my brothers i grieve to see the council is so small and yet i rejoice that you the few who have put me here have come to claim your just reward today you shall see the mighty one himself kronos the most terrible krasis the high priest will assist me prepare krasis

14074,doctor look both of you
14075,look    doctor 1

14088,oh yes
14089,right come on then
14090,twice round the park
14091,right
14092,at the moment id believe anything
14093,whos that
14094,no i dont do you doctor
14095,what
14096,thats in the black hole
14097,oh
14098,at last a time lord within my power let my guests be brought into my presence
14099,yeah
14100,like that
14101,it looks like aladdins cave
14102,i wonder who it belongs to
14103,and i dont fancy hanging around to meet him im going to try and make a break for it
14104,the time to make a getaway is now while were still near the entrance once they get us down that maze of passageways we shall never get out
14105,perhaps you did doctor but we didnt want to come here and we dont want to stay
14106,looks like ill have to go on my own then
14107,what
14108,no no i suppose youre right
14109,with his life probably
14110,they might not harm him you said we were only here by mistake
14111,but supposing you cant well they might just get rid of us
14112,tyler
14113,it still doesnt make sense doctor we are matter and you say this place is antimatter
14114,so the mere fact of our being here should cause a colossal explosion
14115,just as that organism thing could exist in our world
14116,i just dont believe it this is matter i can see it why i can feel it
14117,its just a pencil isnt it
14118,ah ha thats all very well but thats just a conjuring trick
14119,its fabulous
14120,i did i am the one who brought you here
14121,in the legends of your people i am called omega
14122,no brother time lord i was not destroyed as you can see take the man and the girl
14123,without me there would be no time travel you and our fellow time lords would still be locked in your own time as puny as those creatures you now so graciously protect
14124,dangerous yes but i completed it and i did not expect to be abandoned many thousands of years ago when i left our planet all this was then a star until i arranged its detonation
14125,it was an honour or so i thought then i was to be the one to find and create the power source that would give us mastery over time itself
14126,revered here i was abandoned
14127,i was sacrificed to that supernova i generated those forces and for what to be blown out of existence into this black hole of antimatter my brothers became time lords but i was abandoned and forgotten
14128,i hope youre right
14129,here doctor everything is possible be seated
14130,how does anyone survive force of will mind you might say over antimatter
14131,created from the raw stuff of matter an organism that can exist in your world and mine it brought you here and imbued you with its properties so that you too could exist in both worlds
14132,there are some things that even i cannot do not alone and at this point in my plans i need the help of a brother time lord
14133,and it pleases me to use you against them
14134,but i am defeating them doctor all of their power is insufficient to prevent the cosmic energy drain which i have caused
14135,investigate immediately but do not harm them
14136,what oh nonsense benton i tell you thats a beach out there its probably norfolk or somewhere like that
14137,first we do a recce then we mount a surprise attack mister ollis you will consider yourself under my orders
14138,what if it is it will make an interesting spectacle
14139,i am used to solitude and i shall have had my revenge i shall be satisfied
14140,especially not with those who betrayed and deserted me no doctor you are here for a reason who are you
14141,the organism was programmed to seek out a time lord
14142,i might have known the high council would make some such pathetic attempt to deceive me
14143,be silent  while i consider what shall be your fate  doctor 2
14144,that mister ollis means you and me come on
14145,that was the idea
14146,i beg your pardon
14147,singularity
14148,singularity now i know its supposed to exist
14149,oh look doctors what are you talking about and simple answers please one at a time this time  doctor 2
14150,time lords
14151,well who is this omega anyway
14152,even so you cant let him smash everything up well look hes not allpowerful you know or else why did he need to bring you here
14153,what about your sonic screwdriver
14154,omegas will look if omega can will up an entire world well surely you two could will up a small door well look youre a time lord arent you
14155,in fact youre two time lords well surely your wills combined are a match for his why else do you think the high council wanted the two of you here
14156,its working
14157,but you
14158,through here      the two doctors sneak into the empty room near the throne dais is a doorway with dry ice pouring out of it  doctor 2
14159,what how is it that you two are free
14160,you dare threaten to destroy me you wish to fight the will of omega
14161,the black hole i repeat you are our last chance all three are needed to defeat omega we will use the last of our energy to send you through  doctor 1
14162,its nearer than you think
14163,silence
14164,continue  while you play stupid childish games you face annihilation do you know that you your entire race your precious terrestrials everything and what do you do huh you wrangle and babble of pipes  doctor 2
14165,what are you saying do you plot against me
14166,yes so i imagined but no there was no way out no escape
14167,so long as i control singularity i can make it do my will all these things exist because i will them to exist without me and the unceasing pressure of my will the work of thousands of years would collapse into chaos in microseconds i am if you like the atlas of my world
14168,well your answer
14169,what are you doing i am in haste to be gone  doctor 2
14170,what
14171,if i exist only by my will then my will is to destroy and all things shall be destroyed all things all things      doctor 2
14172,a very good question miss grant come on
14173,but we cant all get in there
14174,no contact since we tried to pass him through the black hole the power level was so low that he may only be able to observe advise not to act
14175,come on doc i mean with two of you there should be twice as many ideas well surely you can think up something to nobble this omega bloke  doctor 2
14176,three of them i didnt know when i was well off doctor
14177,would you mind telling us laymen what you scientists are getting so excited about
14178,mind telling me how
14179,oh splendid
14180,i suppose it would be too much to ask for someone to tell us what all this means
14181,and a flute
14182,oh splendid yes
14183,why whats going to happen
14184,all right i promise
14185,do you think this trickery will save you for long
14186,what is this
14187,i make the terms time lords
14188,what way i know now that you cannot give me my freedom but you can keep me company in the endless empty years that lie ahead if you will both stay here willingly and share my exile then i will spare your friends and their universe
14189,doctor what shall we do
14190,what
14191,are you sure its all right

14201,well i think id better be on my way too thank you for a fascinating trip doctor
14202,whats the matter doctor everything worked out all right didnt it
14203,i know what it is its because you had to trick omega

14205,i suppose youll be rushing off then
14206,yes of course now one must deal with the aliens

14352,well yes but thats slightly different were not animals
14353,oh stop it doctor its not funny

14365,well thats it were done for
14366,well well break our necks if we try to get down there well just go on wandering around this ghastly machine forever well sooner or later well crawl round a corner and run slap into one of them

14382,you are on inter minor
14383,oh no
14384,this container is yours
14385,certainly not it is the property of this lurman the female is his assistant
14386,one wonders why the tribunal is submitting to questioning by this creature shouldnt it be the other way round
14387,really one almost admires its audacity
14388,ones authority comes direct from president zarb himself
14389,one did not allow it one has already ordered the deportation of the lurmans and their machine
14390,well strictly speaking one must concede that er in a sense
14391,look one is forced to remind you that the question before this tribunal is your own eradication as a menace to public health
14392,one is indeed overwhelmed

14517,how did you get away from these things
14518,why
14519,perhaps you do not but some servant of the draconian empire employed them
14520,or theyre showing a misguided loyalty to their draconian masters
14521,to act as spies when you were brought back to earth
14522,just a minute please why should a third party wish to do this
14523,take them away
14524,well weve seen the president
14525,well why their sakes
14526,so
14527,well never mind about that what about getting us out of here
14528,i shall have them brought here immediately i suggest his highness joins me here we shall question them together
14529,you heard me move
14530,perhaps she believed you
14531,i said move
14532,look you can use your mind probe or whatever im telling you the truth
14533,your companion is still with your fellow earthmen
14534,youre part of a plot against the draconian empire
14535,you are working for general williams
14536,such a war would be madness since both empires would be destroyed
14537,it was not attacked at all the whole story is a lie
14538,ogrons
14539,if you tell us the details of general williams plan we shall be able to expose him to your president there will still be a chance for peace
14540,we have mind probing techniques just as efficient as those employed by you earthmen if you do not speak now we shall force you to confess
14541,doctor whereve you been
14542,what happened
14543,oh no
14544,and both sides are blaming us
14545,i see
14546,well doctor shall we try again
14547,are you a member of the draconian secret service
14548,how did you get on the cargo ship
14549,tardis
14550,why did you help the draconians attack the cargo ship
14551,then we must break through his conditioning unless you tell me the truth the real truth i shall be forced to use increased power
14552,youd do better to worry about the effect on your mind
14553,step up the power increase to twelve now are you an agent of the draconians
14554,when do they plan to attack us
14555,how did you board the cargo ship
14556,who first recruited you to serve the draconians
14557,who are the other draconian agents on earth
14558,the truth man i want the truth
14559,doctor are you sure youre all right
14560,oh they kept going on at me to confess
14561,why
14562,so we just sit around here waiting for those jolly old ogrons to turn up again
14563,this may be your chance good luck
14564,im giving you a final chance to tell me the truth
14565,i cant think why you chose to work for the draconians but whatever it is ill double any offer that they have made to you
14566,you leave me no alternative under the powers invested in me by the special security act im sending you to the lunar penal colony
14567,she will remain here i have hopes that away from your influence i might be able to make her see the error of her ways
14568,we are not barbarians if you want to help her why dont you tell me where she comes from id like to inform her family
14569,what did they get you for
14570,you are a political arent you
14571,oh come off it only politicals get sent to the moon none of your common criminals
14572,thousands well i mean criticise the government and youre for it arent you you a member of the peace party
14573,me too i tried to sabotage a military base
14574,no chocolate allowed here
14575,thats what im in for got a trouble maker have we
14576,ill remember you
14577,shut up you  you kit out that man  come with me
14578,well youll find yourself in very good company here my boy i sometimes think there are more members of the peace party up here than back on earth
14579,escape occasionally why do you ask
14580,yes theres an excellent library there are books videofilms handicrafts and discussion groups all sorts of ways of passing the time
14581,thats not one of the things we discuss
14582,what always happens they are dead no one escapes from here
14583,right keep it moving
14584,it contains all the elements to support life
14585,you heard him move
14586,anytime theres no day or night here
14587,no one escapes from here
14588,for all i know you could be a spy for the governor
14589,no a valid point of logic i wonder if i can trust you
14590,yes but we dont know you why did they send you here
14591,we have no proof of that we have no reason to tell you anything
14592,there are warmongers on both sides we are aware of that
14593,anywhere is better than here
14594,well i can
14595,right youre clean report to airlock three for maintenance work you and one other you can choose him yourselves okay
14596,oh just a search all part of the routine
14597,the escape plan its now we have to walk from the airlock across the moons surface we are going to steal a spaceship they have left two spacesuits for us
14598,well i had planned to take another member of the peace party committee but im afraid hell have to give up his place doctor i want you to come with me
14599,we must get you back to earth so that you can tell your story
14600,we have contacts everywhere journalists broadcasters even friends in the government well make them believe you
14601,excellent excellent come on doctor we havent got long
14602,we cant use the main entrance to the space port its too well guarded all we have to do is to walk across the moons surface about ten minutes and were there
14603,a kind of bribery im afraid i promised to get him a free pardon once we get into power
14604,i appealed to his better self now do hurry doctor
14605,yes now doctor clip my cylinder on the back of my suit and then ill fix up yours
14606,it cant be
14607,listen
14608,thats no good theyll never hear us
14609,help help help
14610,i do hope that youre all right doctor
14611,you were trying to escape youve only yourselves to blame for the consequences
14612,cross said he would help us to escape and he left spacesuits for us in the airlock
14613,no sir they stole the suits must have messed it up and taken ones with empty cylinders
14614,im releasing you into the custody of this commissioner he will fly you back to sirius 4 to stand trial
14615,defrauding the sirius 4 dominion bank evasion of planetary income tax assault and battery committed upon the person of a sirius 4 police official taking a spaceship without authority and piloting the said spaceship without payment of tax and insurance landing the said spaceship on an unauthorised area of sirius 3 need i go on
14616,oh come doctor you know the games up why not admit defeat you know this man always works with an accomplice a girl ive got her under lock and key in my ship well doctor are you coming quietly
14617,doctor
14618,well doctor this is an interesting reversal i remember your once visiting me when i was in prison
14619,why youve been locked up
14620,miss grant please i employ them
14621,i dont need any help your simple presence will be quite enough oh by the way i need hardly warn you there is no point in trying to escape this is an interplanetary police spaceship specially built for carrying prisoners as you can see
14622,of course oh and another thing theres a closed circuit television camera trained on you from up there so you will be under continuous observation i think thats all well now if youll excuse me i have some rather complicated astronavigational calculations to work out
14623,that miss grant you will discover when you arrive
14624,right lets go
14625,okay so whats the plan
14626,what about stealing the tardis
14627,you can say that again
14628,and then what happened
14629,in reminiscent mood are you doctor poor miss grant  you have my deepest sympathy
14630,well he is a brigadier after all i mean what do you expect
14631,and you managed to do that have you
14632,what an ingenious fellow you are doctor
14633,thank you doctor
14634,why no no
14635,yes i am the commissioner of earths interplanetary police im taking these two people back to planet sirius 4 for trial here is my warrant of authority
14636,you are in draconian space i am the authority here
14637,but you cant do that im a commissioner of interplanetary police this is my spaceship i tell you you cant do that
14638,you really think hed believe you
14639,so theres a good chance that theyll believe you huh
14640,perhaps miss grant perhaps but one never knows when help may be at hand now if youll excuse me i think that this is going to be rather a long journey so er goodnight
14641,thank you
14642,oh hadnt we better wake our cellmate
14643,majesty i bring you the prisoners
14644,this is an insult
14645,how dare you address the emperor in a manner reserved for a noble of draconia
14646,be silent there is a legend among our people of a man who assisted the fifteenth emperor at a time of great trouble when we were almost overwhelmed by a great plague from outer space but you could not be that man no earthman lives so long
14647,he did
14648,your majesty this man was and still is my prisoner
14649,all earthmen are determined upon war
14650,the earthmen who attacked our spaceships they have been seen many times
14651,your majesty
14652,i too welcome your wisdom your majesty nobody could be more devoted to the cause of peace than i as a commissioner of earths interplanetary police i have devoted my life to the cause of law and order and law and order can only exist in a time of peace
14653,quiet its the same noise that i heard on the cargo ship doctor its the ogrons
14654,now will you believe in the treachery of the earthmen
14655,i see one of your earth soldiers who attacked my palace and killed my people
14656,yes its fading its almost gone
14657,do theres only one thing we can do make sure that the doctor and his evidence is never allowed to reach earth
14658,let me take him for questioning he shall answer to me i shall use the mind probe
14659,that is true we do fear the earthmen and they fear us
14660,they will not believe us
14661,i think youre supposed to peel it first oh well  hey you know you want to be very careful of him hes not as stupid as he looks i know i know women arent allowed to speak you know i think its about time that womens lib was brought to draconia
14662,not too happy he seemed to enjoy his banana though doctor where are we
14663,unless your earth people destroy us
14664,what is that
14665,of course i do but i dont know rocket fire at long range its i dont know somehow it lacks that personal touch
14666,well cant we talk to them and tell them who we are
14667,this is earth police spaceship number one four two your ship is one that has been reported as stolen you will please reduce speed so that we can board you
14668,why should we submit to this delay our mission has diplomatic immunity
14669,doctor are you sure we dont really know if its the police
14670,right theyve reduced speed they should be within striking distance now thats about it release the first missile
14671,its an ogron ship
14672,come on doctor keep still keep still thats better thats about it right fire            master

14676,the prisoner
14677,right unlock
14678,your highness weve heard the doctors theory before and with respect there is still no concrete evidence i myself would like to believe you but as you can see i need proof to convince my people
14679,with earth on the brink of war how can we divert our forces into such a pointless expedition suppose this is yet another draconian trick to divide our strength
14680,your highness please accept my deepest regrets for the wrong i have done your people
14681,you must tell them it is not the draconians who attack you
14682,madam president everything is ready we shall use my personal scoutship
14683,thanks cheerful  yuk

14686,let me talk to them i shall explain
14687,max hyperdrive
14688,i regret the behaviour of my people the officer will be punished
14689,i cant get her back on course sir one of the drive outlets is malfunctioning
14690,no good sir ive got to control it manually

14695,if you want me to take her in that close sir we may have to enter the atmosphere what about that repair will it stand the heat
14696,were losing the signal  jo
14697,what is that signal
14698,splendid thatll lead us right to them
14699,the drive outlet circuits gone again
14700,yes master
14701,one dominant lifeform a large and savage reptile
14702,doctor has it occurred to you what were going to do when we discover the source of this signal
14703,what is that
14704,what is it
14705,doctor
14706,surrender or youll be shot down
14707,fire
14708,very well he will remain your prisoner until the war is concluded then you will bring him to us and we shall exterminate him we shall now return to our base and prepare the army of the daleks
14709,hello doctor
14710,why do these dalek creatures wish to set your people and mine at war
14711,doctor doctor would the masters little fearbox help
14712,oh

14742,what log doctor i dont know what youre talking about
14743,doctor
14744,doctor
14745,doctor
14746,things growing in this jungle seem more like animal than plant life the light is changing it seems as if its daybreak theres a sudden change in temperature i havent seen any form of intelligent life except except those bits of statue by the tardis
14747,hello hello is anybody there
14748,lets go and find him
14749,right sit him down here
14750,she told us where you were
14751,what are you staring at
14752,thats not likely
14753,a planet many systems from here
14754,how did you know that
14755,when
14756,dalek war
14757,thats impossible that was generations ago you couldnt have been there
14758,how
14759,in our legend there is a being a figure from another planet who came to skaro when the thals were in their greatest peril in something called a tardis he had three companions with him
14760,and their leader was called
14761,are you trying to tell us that you are the doctor
14762,thats nonsense youve come to spy on us what are you doing on this planet here of all the planets in the galaxy answer
14763,vaber give me the spray
14764,the spray vaber
14765,they spread their spores in that liquid theyve discharged and the fungus spreads very quickly unless the surface has been specially treated turn your hand over there that should be all right now
14766,without special treatment it would have spread all over your body
14767,until finally youd have been engulfed by it
14768,no we wait for codal
14769,spiridon one of the nastiest pieces of space garbage in the ninth system
14770,oh yes vegetation thats more like animal life than plant creatures hostile to everything including themselves and a climate that changes from tropical in the day to subfreezing in the night
14771,oh yes the spiridons theyre invisible
14772,dont worry you will
14773,no i cant tell you that thats top secret
14774,it was your choice nobody made you come
14775,we think so
14776,there were seven but our commander was killed on touchdown and weve lost three others since
14777,yeah
14778,thanks ill think about it
14779,why should i you come here out of nowhere and then claim to be something out of a legend
14780,you all right now
14781,good well take you to your friend
14782,after that youre on your own if you see me signal dive for cover quickly and dont make a sound understood
14783,lets chance it
14784,here
14785,point it in this direction press the control on top and youll see what were up against
14786,you seem to know a good deal about daleks
14787,even so it gives them quite an advantage
14788,they discovered it by studying the spiridons its an antireflecting light wave their problem is that to create the energy required they have to generate fantastic power so they cant sustain it for very long
14789,id like to investigate a bit further lets lift off the top so that
14790,you wait here doctor codal and i will scout ahead we wont be long
14791,too cautious things would be different if miro was still alive
14792,expedition commander he was killed when we landed
14793,spacecraft doctor next in seniority so he took command and a fine mess hes making of it
14794,do you three more dead nothing achieved nothing even planned hell go on being cautious until were all killed
14795,oh weve got explosives and weapons we could attack the dalek laboratory and wipe them all out
14796,well as far as i know theres not more than twelve just a scientific group here to try and learn the technique of invisibility one determined attack and we could destroy them all
14797,as far as i know
14798,i imagine theyve been totally subjugated the usual dalek technique of rule by terror
14799,yeah
14800,the eyeplants
14801,theyve come in very useful
14802,they get very agitated whenever an invisible spiridon comes near them its given us a well a kind of early warning system
14803,get my knife
14804,what happened
14805,i said im all right thanks doctor
14806,what do you mean
14807,vaber
14808,theyre coming closer
14809,theres our ship your friends inside
14810,position to fire
14811,aim
14812,proceed as ordered
14813,fire repeat full power
14814,enter
14815,where are the others taron and vaber
14816,im fine splitting headache but ill survive
14817,why didnt they kill us straight away doctor
14818,i just didnt give myself time to think if i had i certainly wouldnt have taken the risk
14819,bravery ive been terrified ever since i landed on this planet its different for taron and vaber theyre professionals theyve seen action before
14820,they know how to deal with fear theyre used to living close to death im not im a scientist not an adventurer
14821,yes
14822,no none of us did were not a warlike people doctor weve only just developed space flight no one had attempted a voyage of this length before but every man and woman from my division volunteered over six hundred of them you see i didnt even have the courage to be the odd man out what are you laughing at
14823,what is it then
14824,im not convinced but thanks anyway
14825,escape
14826,battery
14827,wasnt that the girl we met your assistant
14828,took her prisoner
14829,all in good time you must rest while the potion is taking effect when youre feeling better ill tell you everything i can
14830,well what now if we cant even get the door open
14831,but theyll be a dalek standing outside
14832,how
14833,theres nothing that i can see
14834,well the one thing we have got is time
14835,whats that a spaceship coming in too fast burning up
14836,thats right the daleks guidance system functions by means of high frequency radio impulses
14837,it should give them quite a headache
14838,im going to try it
14839,if this jamming device of yours works well have a weapon that we can use against all the daleks we can give the lot of them brainstorms
14840,well how long will it last then
14841,if what
14842,forget it
14843,whats that
14844,attention the prisoners are to be taken for interrogation immediately  dalek 2
14845,prisoners will stand
14846,surrender or you will be exterminated
14847,that little machine of yours has quite an effect
14848,back
14849,all daleks units will report to lower levels maximum security search to commence immediately locate and destroy prisoners locate and destroy locate and destroy locate and destroy
14850,halt halt
14851,shut the doors
14852,if they keep driving us down to the lower levels well never get out
14853,let me go first doctor at least ive got this
14854,look the shaft
14855,help me free this grill hurry the ice is moving up behind us
14856,eruption nearing danger peak all cooling ducts now being closed down all cooling ducts now being closed down
14857,i cant hold it
14858,look
14859,you go on ill be all right
14860,no you get inside
14861,get in
14862,theres nothing we can do nothing
14863,bring cutting equipment
14864,doctor
14865,looks as if all marats courage was for nothing theres no other door
14866,what do you make of it
14867,yes its big enough to freeze an ocean
14868,but why all their cooling needs are taken care of by the ice tunnels
14869,well its a ventilator shaft carries out the hot gases from the unit
14870,what do you mean nobody could climb that
14871,theyre cutting through doctor doctor theyre cutting through the door
14872,well what are we going to do
14873,well were certainly not going to float out of here
14874,hurry up doctor its pretty hot in here
14875,so hot air rises
14876,fantastic will it work
14877,grab that
14878,rise will you rise
14879,its not going to work doctor its not going to work
14880,escape from this section is impossible the prisoners are hiding locate and destroy they are to be exterminated
14881,any idea how far to the surface
14882,all mechanisms primed the bombs will selfdetonate  dalek 2
14883,id prefer a rocket to take me off this planet
14884,doctor theres something coming up after us
14885,doctor look
14886,ill try mine
14887,thanks to the doctor

14891,no i wasnt look doctor whats been happening whereve you been
14892,a trifle worrying
14893,yes
14894,look doctor the last id heard about you youd been captured by the daleks right
14895,and i was told that they were going to take you
14896,because theyre doing all these experiments
14897,and then i thought you were going to be in them and i didnt know what i was going to do
14898,if the aliens are not taken the bacteria is to be released without immunity no living thing can survive the disease all will be exterminated
14899,well doctor you didnt look very safe well i thought you were dying and i went out to try and find some help for you
14900,well doctor you didnt tell me anything you just rushed into the tardis you rattled off some sort of a message and well then you flaked out
14901,uh huh
14902,doctor what did you say to the time lords in your message
14903,but what are the daleks doing on this planet
14904,but when we were on the ogron planet we put a stop to their plan to sort of cause a war
14905,just us
14906,right
14907,yes
14908,i dont think im equipped to handle all this any more
14909,this job doesnt allow for human weakness
14910,i thought they had i was wrong
14911,well i managed to get two of the bombs before that ive hidden them
14912,and cold you havent experienced a full spiridon night doctor you dont know what cold is until you have
14913,its an area of huge boulders they absorb the heat of the sun and then discharge it at night
14914,not exactly doctor all the animal life from the jungle goes there as well
14915,im jo how do you do uh oh you dont know about a handshake well you see its an old earth custom we clasp hands like that and it shows that were good friends and that were pleased to meet one another come on
14916,theyre not animals doctor spiridons they wear those furs against the cold
14917,not particularly why
14918,almost as though their mechanical reflexes werent functioning properly
14919,i dont know weve heard them before never seen them latep take first guard doctor
14920,do you mind
14921,doctor the bombs have gone
14922,ill do what i have to do alone
14923,i intend to codal will you come with me doctor would you stay here
14924,be careful taron
14925,yes
14926,we must get them
14927,theyve gone it scared them off
14928,thats it
14929,and if they rush us
14930,but doctor there wont be enough wood for the fire
14931,penny for them
14932,once wed worked out the plan he wanted to attack straight away
14933,to blow up the refrigeration unit
14934,but codal said if we destroyed the refrigeration unit wed be destroying the daleks
14935,oh i get it the daleks you saw in the arsenal were in sort of suspended animation
14936,and you mean they need a constant controllable low temperature because the volcanos too unstable
14937,jo
14938,doctor no thats wester hes the spiridon that helped me
14939,yes
14940,the daleks have prepared a bacteria bomb it will destroy every living thing on this planet
14941,i shall go back into the city perhaps i can find some way of delaying them
14942,what shall we do about taron and codal
14943,doctor what shall we do
14944,well howre we going to do all that
14945,shush
14946,we persuaded a couple of spiridons to part with them
14947,ill tell you about that later weve got to move away from here theres a dalek patrol right behind us
14948,we cant risk a straightforward confrontation
14949,all right what have you got in mind
14950,how do we do that
14951,what do you want us to do
14952,ill go
14953,wait latep im coming with you
14954,doctor im tired of being hunted too
14955,well keep watch
14956,yes theyre all over the place molten ice pools a sort of natural spring
14957,im sorry i dont see the significance of all this weve known about these ice pools for some time
14958,yes yes i see come on lets look around find a way of making it work
14959,yes were ready
14960,scatter
14961,give protective fire
14962,we did it
14963,latep switch on your thermal liner
14964,yes the shock of the sudden cold must have killed them straight away
14965,yes i think so
14966,can we come with you doctor
14967,here you are doctor
14968,you could put it like that
14969,youll do in a pinch good luck doctor
14970,good luck
14971,all right
14972,come on
14973,but theres a spiridon in there
14974,bacteria is released do not open door repeat do not open door
14975,we cannot leave here no one can enter we can never leave here never never never
14976,all right rebec  dalek 2
14977,alert alert alert aliens at liberty in city instigate condition of maximum security alert alert alert
14978,codal come back and give us a hand
14979,pursue pursue alarm pursue     dalek 3
14980,and what then one bomb against an army of daleks
14981,right
14982,right
14983,and with the spiridons power to become invisible nothing can stop them
14984,come on latep weve still got a long way to go
14985,what are you after doctor
14986,the main switches are probably in the control room we dont want to go back there
14987,yeah
14988,the refrigeration units been shut down the temperatures starting to rise
14989,doctor
14990,take a look at this
14991,i can get my arm right inside
14992,its getting warmer down here
14993,doctor
14994,theres no power left to operate the door come on
14995,doctor theres no sign of jo and latep and theyre nearly through the barricade
14996,right come on
14997,the bomb get down
14998,the timing mechanism isnt functioning properly
14999,i think so itll take a minute or two
15000,doctor doctor youre right there is a power ramp it goes up to ground level i think we can climb it
15001,what are you planning to do doctor
15002,bury the lot of them
15003,but it wont destroy them just put them back into their deep frozen state of suspended animation
15004,we did what we could though
15005,right thats it
15006,yes come on you two
15007,hurry up doctor hurry up
15008,doctor i need to look over the controls of that ship
15009,doctor wed never have succeeded without all your help i wish there was some way of thanking you

15035,where are we going
15036,oh no no they cant
15037,its criminal absolutely criminal
15038,listen and at last the ministry has given the green light to global chemicals
15039,common sense has triumphed at last well dont they realise the pollution it will cause
15040,and the futile protests of professor jones
15041,he wont give up you know a man like professor jones will never give up
15042,to pack a suitcase
15043,off off where
15044,im not going to metebelis three
15045,well south wales of course llanfairfach
15046,but doctor its exactly your cup of tea this fellows bright green apparently and dead
15047,ah but there are international implications you see possibility of sabotage at global chemicals its units duty to protect them my duty
15048,no no look its time to call a halt its time that the world awoke to the alarm bell of pollution instead of sliding down the slippery slopes of of of whatever it is
15049,you will at least accept a lift i trust yes miss grant im going there too also the doctor i hope
15050,wouldnt like to have to order you doctor
15051,yes ten minutes miss grant

15112,i cant i just cant
15113,doctor its not that im afraid exactly its just its just those maggots
15114,all right
15115,you are mistaken  fell goes into a nearby room which controls the pumping operations he takes a clipboard from the wall and sits at a console elgin sneaks in and hides behind some large vertical pipes to watch
15116,now what
15117,how do you know it leads to the surface
15118,stella will you get the minister of ecology on the phone please

15125,okay
15126,of course
15127,right
15128,whats that smell
15129,you mean it leads to global chemicals
15130,doctor theres a sort of vibration in this pipe can you feel it
15131,what does it mean
15132,where can these creatures have come from do you think they are linked to the oil waste
15133,hes gone

15166,yes but i dont understand
15167,did it hurt
15168,well the point is that the maggot cells changed the internal structure of the human cells into their own nature
15169,thats what happened to those poor miners
15170,well what now
15171,down the mine again
15172,cliff old jones the milk says theyre going to blow up the mine
15173,right sir
15174,okay lads clear the area
15175,get a move on
15176,youve exactly thirty two and a half minutes
15177,for over a quarter of an hour ive listened patiently to you doctor now its my turn
15178,please doctor there is no point in going on like this you have convinced me
15179,you have convinced me that you are an arrant sensation monger a political hothead and a scientific charlatan giant maggots indeed
15180,time to spread more calumnies more lies
15181,thats enough i warn you doctor if you persist in these slanders i shall have you restrained under the emergency powers act
15182,how do you do
15183,in two and a half minutes the brigadiers going to press that button
15184,im sorry doctor but the brigadiers orders and my own are quite clear
15185,ten nine eight
15186,perhaps its all for the best
15187,i dont think we need detain you doctor
15188,and doctor
15189,yes
15190,well im not such a dunderhead as you all seem to think i dont like this fellow stevens any more than you do
15191,orders doctor orders im still a soldier you know but that doesnt stop me having an inside man to have a shuftie round
15192,you mean theyve tunnelled their way out
15193,giant maggots what kind of insects are they going to turn into
15194,yes i see him well i never thought id fire in anger at a dratted caterpillar but
15195,greyhound one to greyhound three hows the spray working over  benton
15196,with what
15197,theres any amount of it out there going begging
15198,what then
15199,simplicity itself
15200,of course not brigadier if ever i want anything theres always somebody right at my elbow to lend a hand
15201,hold on a minute
15202,well naturally i have the utmost confidence in the security in fact theyve er doubled it up since the problem arose so weve no worries there
15203,youve set yourself quite a task doctor theyre pretty efficient up there
15204,wheres the other bloke
15205,who are you then
15206,look i havent got time to listen to you blathering just get on in
15207,ill join you downstairs
15208,i like your handbag
15209,in my office
15210,see you later then bye
15211,well clearly global chemicals is responsible for the trouble at the pit
15212,itd be like stealing the crown jewels
15213,not much chance but we could try
15214,everything important is isolated on the top floor theres a special lift at the end of the block it works with some sort of key but the directors the only person whos got one
15215,theres one other thing the director isnt the real boss he takes his instructions from someone else
15216,hows the old man doris
15217,how kind of you to drop in doctor ive been looking forward to having a little chat with you
15218,shes gone off to look for the doctor i think hey you two dont you obey orders any more dont want to be telling you a story if youre not going to carry it out
15219,oh really doctor as far as i can gather from your computer record at unit the difficult thing is to stop you talking no no no you wont provoke me so easily
15220,and you and your human friends arent you machines inefficient and organic machines
15221,no
15222,ah thank you because in that case so am i
15223,i am the first biomorphic organisational systems supervisor
15224,precisely
15225,my designers also found it amusing i find it suitable
15226,oh no no no no no i am the only computer ever to be linked to a human brain
15227,yes stevens and i learned from him that secret of human creativity is inefficiency the human brain is a very poor computer indeed it makes illogical guesses which turn out to be more logical than logic itself
15228,i programmed stevens to programme me to be inefficient i am now selfcontrolling i am selfsufficient i am the greatest being this planet has ever seen i am the boss
15229,how well you understand me doctor
15230,and as such uniquely fitted to carry out my prime directive
15231,hello brigadier this is jo greyhound one come in please hello brigadier this is jo greyhound one come in please
15232,the bombing has started
15233,the air force will soon have obliterated those creatures out there the brigadier hes in charge
15234,stevens arranged it on my instructions you see the facts offer it as the only logical solution
15235,oh you are mistaken i cant be wrong i am infallible
15236,er the matter is not relevant
15237,it can be worked out yes er
15238,er your your statements do not correlate they are incompatible it is not a valid query give me time doctor i shall work it out i shall work it out it cannot be answered but i will work it out i shall work it out i must
15239,it is no use begging for mercy doctor
15240,cliff cliff we can go now its stopped cliff
15241,it is
15242,it does
15243,i will not be angered i will eradicate anger it effects efficiency
15244,doctor believe me we wish you no harm
15245,in the end we all want the same thing an ordered society with everyone happy well fed
15246,whats best for global chemicals is best for the world is best for you
15247,freedom from fear freedom from pain
15248,guards
15249,hmm hes right we shall not kill him now we shall postpone that pleasure
15250,cliff cliff please wake up theyre getting closer cliff

15356,space hardware new alloys guidance systems methods of propulsion
15357,well id rather a bright idea its rather hard to keep an eye on all these scientist chaps at home so i had these cubicles put up on several floors confined the whole lot to barracks all my eggs in one basket so to speak

15429,ill overlook that insult for the moment what is your native planet
15430,ah yes a race of great technical achievement but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault
15431,im only a lowly commander doctor i merely quote from the appreciation circulated by our military intelligence
15432,my only ambition at the moment is to return to my squadron you can be of value to me you can help me to repair this ship
15433,primitives i adapted my ships frequency modulator and projected myself forward as far as i could unfortunately i only had the power to reach the twentieth century
15434,yes but the work goes slowly
15435,do not attempt to bargain with me doctor take that seat there by the controls move
15436,im placing you under autocontrol doctor to ensure your complete cooperation

15461,what is your answer
15462,then we are lost we cannot stand against them
15463,but how with a handful of men
15464,by the use of your magic
15465,your magic will have to be powerful indeed to discourage irongron
15466,heres a few more for you doctor
15467,lady eleanors got every serving wench in the castle sewing away like mad
15468,oh typically masculine arrangement though we do all the dirty work you get all the fun

15491,and that is
15492,you advise the impossible doctor when they outnumber us so greatly
15493,ragwort henbane loveinamist fennel sesame most we have dried in the kitchens the rest grow in the woods nearby

15515,you wish for my answer doctor
15516,get up get back to work

15518,my only concern is to rejoin our glorious struggle for freedom
15519,your time lord philosophy is egalitarian twaddle it is a weakness

15618,suppose suppose there was an egg buried in the ground somewhere and somehow or other it hatched out
15619,yes ah no no how would it grow to that size without anyone noticing

15630,a variety of prehistoric reptiles began to appear in the central london area there was as you can imagine considerable panic and some loss of life
15631,theres been quite a bit of that im afraid but were keeping them under control
15632,well as soon as these creatures appear we make sure that theyre contained within the evacuated zone and dont wander off into populated areas
15633,but things that size where could they go
15634,hmm
15635,all right brigadier you can have your extra patrols but i warn you i shall expect results
15636,oh weve been waiting for you you know may i ask where youve been
15637,well
15638,doctor this is general finch hes in overall charge of the entire operation
15639,yes um doctor
15640,never mind your scientific gobbledygook
15641,rubbish
15642,civilians are not allowed in this zone have her evacuated immediately
15643,sir
15644,ill thank you to stop interfering

15652,disappeared you mean you disappeared when it got too close
15653,vanished into thin air i suppose
15654,well not exactly
15655,a what
15656,sir suppose we accept the doctors theory for the purposes of discussion what happens next
15657,and what good will that do
15658,it couldnt be a natural phenomenon could it doctor something going wrong with time
15659,doctor what about that man we saw in the garage
15660,youre overlooking one thing this whole zone has been evacuated
15661,but all powers been cut off in central london just minimal emergency supplies
15662,do you really think you can knock out a dinosaur with that thing
15663,how
15664,i see
15665,what exactly will it do
15666,i didnt think these creatures had any brains
15667,whatll happen to the dinosaur when you switch this thing on
15668,and what will you do with your monster when youve got it
15669,and whatll that tell you
15670,will you get an accurate fix
15671,jolly good doctor well i think id better let you get on with it

15679,ah there you are doctor now what are you up to
15680,i do apologise for the interruption doctor i realise how busy you are

15684,now i mustnt keep you doctor i just wanted to make your acquaintance
15685,well i admire your courage doctor i only hope it works
15686,tell me doctor have you any theories as to why all this is happening
15687,but why
15688,yes but why london who not the yorkshire moors or the highlands of scotland
15689,sir theyve spotted one section twelve power station the chief engineer said if we dont remove it quickly hell have to switch off
15690,er a patosomething
15691,transport standing by doctor
15692,its round there
15693,are you sure this is the kind you want doctor its rather large
15694,really why is that
15695,doctor suppose this gadget of yours doesnt work
15696,but isnt that thing dangerous
15697,well be ready with covering fire
15698,all set up then doctor
15699,whats the difference
15700,it will stay asleep wont it doctor
15701,dont you worry miss smith those chains will hold him down well doctor now what do we do
15702,then perhaps i can have your attention
15703,well ive been checking up into this whole question of time travel
15704,ah i know you know about it but what im interested in doctor is other people who know about it
15705,oh one or two have dabbled
15706,i think someone has
15707,this is the only one ive been able to check up on doctor
15708,i remember he applied for a big government grant it was refused
15709,hes disappeared
15710,about six months ago he completely vanished i checked with my newspaper contacts up north no trace
15711,well its a possibility he was a brilliant scientist and he must have been bitterly disappointed when the government refused that grant
15712,yes ill get on to it intelligence records may have something on him
15713,right they must be on file somewhere
15714,yes should be there by now
15715,yes of course
15716,oh what about your little pet out there
15717,general finch has lent me a squad
15718,but suppose it dematerialises while youre not here
15719,the minister has some information for you doctor about this elusive fellow whitaker
15720,i was chairman of the committee that considered his application for a government grant
15721,oh yes not that i understood them of course but my scientific colleagues on the committee assured me that they were utter nonsense
15722,he may be brilliant in other fields miss smith but as far as his time travel theory is concerned i was assured its worthless doctor i understand that you have set up an experiment which may give us the answer to all this
15723,thank you very much
15724,thank you
15725,unfortunately general finch is in charge of the military side
15726,maybe general finch took her out to dinner
15727,brigadier speaking lay on a jeep for the doctor will you oh and did you see miss smith leave here oh thank you she went off in the generals car
15728,help someone open the door help open the door for gods sake
15729,well somebody locked that door so i couldnt get out
15730,here we are doctor hasnt been knocked about too much
15731,we found this sir they were all like that cut clean through
15732,dismissed no not you benton
15733,yes but what i cant understand sir is why should anyone want to cut those chains
15734,yes of course thatll be it well doctor any suggestions
15735,we havent got to capture another dinosaur
15736,well why didnt you do that in the first place
15737,doctor exactly how much energy would be needed to make these things appear
15738,miss smith that was one of the first things that occurred to me i made a thorough check and i can assure you that there are no unaccounted for nuclear generators in the central london area
15739,all right
15740,after you miss smith
15741,yes doctor
15742,yes of course
15743,oh fine as far as i know
15744,well she didnt want to rest i got her some transport and she shot off somewhere
15745,she wouldnt say she said to tell you shed gone out to play
15746,id like an explanation of this latest fiasco brigadier you capture a dinosaur and lose it again an aircraft hangar is wrecked and into the bargain miss smith is almost killed now why is this man allowed to persist in his ridiculous and useless schemes you deny that absolutely nothing has been achieved
15747,youll never get it off the ground doctor wouldnt you rather have a jeep
15748,well take care call in as soon as you have any information
15749,you cant be allowed to go about saying these things youll have to be reeducated
15750,where
15751,you sure weve come to the right place
15752,you must have been talking to miss smith
15753,didnt she tell you she came to me with the most marvellous theory about such a place having been built under central london
15754,project abandoned no further action to be taken see doctor
15755,back to unit hq i sent her in my own car
15756,i can check for you
15757,well back to unit hq sir
15758,apart from your story doctor which forgive me is pretty unbelievable there isnt a shred of evidence to suggest that this place exists now you heard the minister yourself it was never built
15759,and what possible reason could the minister have for being involved in the apparition of these monsters
15760,well what do you expect me to do
15761,i cant do that without authority i need permission from general finch
15762,theres a call for you doctor

15924,exxilon had grown old before life had even begun on other planets our ancestors solved the mysteries of science built craft that travelled through space they were the supreme beings of the universe
15925,they used their sciences to make the city into a living thing it could protect itself repair itself maintain itself they even gave it a brain
15926,yes we almost qualified for that ourselves
15927,yes we do fear it but we dont worship it our aim is to destroy it unless we succeed our race will vanish from this planet
15928,exterminate am losing control am losing control am
15929,i saw them too doctor do they mean anything to you
15930,seen them before where

15950,they continue round here
15951,daleks
15952,what did you do
15953,and that made it slide open
15954,can we get out again
15955,weve walked into a trap
15956,but these some of them must have been here for centuries
15957,what test
15958,but i dont understand this is simply a pattern on the wall
15959,and if we fail
15960,key symbol
15961,locate next access point
15962,i dont understand
15963,well was that really necessary doctor
15964,an empty room
15965,moving inside this city is like being inside a living thing
15966,weve got to try somehow      doctor
15967,there was a light that shone in my eyes a blinding light
15968,no but we must
15969,now the first thing weve got to do is get these filled anything will do if the doctor does manage to restore power we have to be ready
15970,weve come quite a way without any tests perhaps were safe now
15971,now what
15972,no
15973,look
15974,this is the brain of the city

15992,it is not necessary you will perish with the rest of the creatures
15993,dont you think earth will send another mission now that the power barrier has been broken we could have another ship here in less than a month
15994,all life and make further landings here impossible
15995,well its not much consolation but at least they dont have the parrinium
15996,he must have hidden away when we put the bags on board
15997,doctor look look at the city
15998,oh mighty aggedor make known your will do not seek vengeance on your servants let your judgment fall on those who have truly offended thee
15999,oh no it isnt is it doctor

16011,what was that
16012,run doctor quick

16023,he was my father he died when i was a child
16024,alien name those who sent you and your life may be spared
16025,everyone on peladon knows the story of the doctor what better disguise for an alien spy and saboteur
16026,doctor whats that
16027,doctor
16028,it is its the doctor
16029,its like a miracle doctor all these years and you havent changed a bit
16030,well i dont think thats good enough what about an apology for the
16031,im sorry doctor but i dont see why i should put up with it and as for your friend here the female is of no importance indeed
16032,well
16033,yes well if you hadnt missed the target by about five hundred yards and fifty years we wouldnt be in this mess
16034,to beg you to send the federation aliens home
16035,that is unfair doctor there have been many difficulties
16036,and we have got to step up the production of trisilicate its essential to our war effort
16037,but we were the victims of a vicious and unprovoked attack by the forces of galaxy five
16038,thats what vega nexos thought saboteurs agents from galaxy five
16039,ive told you before local politics are not my concern
16040,you see the dangers we face doctor peladon is still a barbarous and primitive planet
16041,he wont talk to you these people are fanatics doctor
16042,the armoury
16043,so doctor since you are in league with the rebels and have helped them escape you shall die in their place
16044,what gratitude do we owe you
16045,you may lord ortron
16046,but how can you help us
16047,very well we will trust you doctor for the present captain
16048,the queens champion will escort you
16049,mmm just as long as he hasnt talked himself into a whole lot more
16050,one of the aliens has just entered the cave with the queens champion we must sacrifice them both
16051,im restoring the holy mountain to appease the spirit of aggedor
16052,the spirit of aggedor has killed the queens champion
16053,i owed you my life doctor now were even
16054,why should you wish to help us
16055,what can you do
16056,nobody uses aggedor his spirit is angry with us
16057,the miners will not work while aggedor is angry
16058,and now they take the sonic lance down into the mine to rip the heart out of the sacred mountain no wonder aggedors angry with these people
16059,but whos causing it
16060,and what are we going to do
16061,thats right
16062,very well doctor we shall take your advice
16063,right doctor
16064,searching the tunnels for me
16065,halt gebek youre under arrest right back to the citadel
16066,i must go with them doctor perhaps i can prevent more madness
16067,no
16068,youre safe they said youd been blown up in the cavern
16069,ettis has just robbed the armoury
16070,so doctor you too admit your guilt
16071,i need no advice from spies and saboteurs
16072,you have blasphemed in the temple of aggedor therefore by aggedor shall you both be punished
16073,you will admit us to the temple
16074,the decision is no longer yours or mine your majesty the girl and the doctor have gone to face the judgement of aggedor
16075,well i dont think anythings broken what are they going to do just leave us here
16076,oh doctor theres something in here with us something alive
16077,too late your majesty
16078,i dont think he does doctor
16079,you should have been a lion tamer doctor how did you manage to do that
16080,not likely now look doctor this reunion is all very touching but what happens to us now
16081,chairs and refreshments for our guests you will please accept our apologies
16082,you may sit
16083,now what did you discover in your investigation at the mines
16084,what about ettis
16085,what should we do
16086,but dont you see your majesty ortron just wants to make sure that the benefits of joining the federation go to him and his aristocratic friends
16087,i will try your plan doctor can you get a message to gebek for me
16088,tell him to come to the citadel and meet with me in secret i would hear the grievances of his people and do my best to remedy them
16089,go as quickly as you can
16090,nonsense gebek they dont need us the federation will import alien workers and mine the ore with their new machines
16091,it seemed the advisable course of action doctor eckersley agreed
16092,hey doctor i thought you
16093,ah before you go doctor you know when i was looking for you and got lost in the tunnels
16094,no no it was before all that started now listen whoevers faking aggedor would need a lot of technological equipment right
16095,empty as far as he knows but suppose somebodys in there the place isnt in use itd make the perfect hideout
16096,contact gebek you intend to contact your rebel friends you may have deceived the queen but you have not deceived me you will remain in the citadel until my investigations into your background are complete
16097,pompous old idiot
16098,good luck doctor
16099,you were warned doctor you were ordered to stay in the citadel you have disobeyed my command take him to the dungeons
16100,well theyll only go if it looks as if theres no need for them now if everything was running smoothly
16101,youre sure okay
16102,hey you
16103,soon have you out of there doctor
16104,sarah told me the queen wants to see me
16105,well what now then
16106,if federation troops land doctor my people will fight i promise you
16107,they must be mad my miners wont work with guards standing over them
16108,this is the place doctor but be careful there is evil here
16109,well several of my people have been attacked by magic and their minds destroyed
16110,doctor can you hear back there down the mine
16111,theyre coming this way doctor
16112,let us see what has emerged  you say that the miners have rebelled against their proper rulers but gebek here says that the nobles have cheated them of their rights you say that the doctor here is a spy and a saboteur but the ambassador says that he is an old and valued friend  you say that your god appears to you because he is angry but the doctor here is sure that the appearances are caused by trickery
16113,excellent a splendid example to you all now listen to me all of you i am not concerned with the situation here on peladon one thing concerns me and one thing only the federation must have the trisilicate it needs
16114,he was willing enough to do it on his own account
16115,isnt there some way you can help them doctor
16116,to the death you shall not rob peladon while a living soul remains to defend it
16117,if we cannot have the trisilicate then our space fleet will blast your hostile planet to dust
16118,must i remind you yet again ambassador here on peladon i am the law yes i think perhaps it would be safer to order your execution at once
16119,doctor that was your trial
16120,meaning yourself doctor
16121,how about that eckersley just as long as he gets his wretched machinery going he doesnt care how its done or who suffers
16122,oh why cant we just go home
16123,no i suppose youre right
16124,hmm
16125,yes
16126,sskel
16127,thats impossible the commander and his troops have only just arrived
16128,why
16129,this is appalling it is treason
16130,where are you going doctor
16131,if only they hadnt taken the doctor off to the commun
16132,oh doctor
16133,our people would sooner die than be enslaved
16134,yes they would if they understood what was happening
16135,congratulations doctor most satisfactory the miners are back at work and stocks are building up again eckersley tells me that the refinery will soon be in operation
16136,shall we say suspended doctor you live while you are useful
16137,i still do not trust you doctor but i think you have realised that your only chance of survival lies in full cooperation
16138,do not attempt to leave
16139,you be careful doctor if azaxyr thinks youre doublecrossing him hell kill you
16140,well what are you going to do
16141,youll tell no one
16142,well yes but whatll happen to them
16143,they collapse
16144,yes but the settlement has come so easily that i distrust it and now if you will excuse me your majesty
16145,oh it doesnt look very safe
16146,what do we do when theyre all down the mines
16147,ah quite the little napoleon arent we
16148,you all right doctor
16149,ettis has the sonic lance in a cave on mount megeshra
16150,he threatens to blow up the citadel ive got to stop him
16151,well you dont know the way
16152,continue down to the end of this tunnel
16153,into the big cavern and the path to the cave is on the other side
16154,youd better take this you may need it
16155,you will tell me
16156,no im going to blow up the citadel kill those federation butchers
16157,i dont believe you its a trick youre working for them youve sold out youre like gebek and the rest of them
16158,do not distress yourself ambassador the sonic lance has a selfdestruct circuit which i have already preset by remote control if the rebel should try to fire it it will destroy itself it will of course kill all those in the area
16159,yes doctor youre right i am a fool
16160,now ambassador we have work to do there are several matters i wish to discuss with you concerning the future administration of this planet on more efficient lines i shall require your help          gebek
16161,oh i was just on my way to find you well did you manage to stop him
16162,thank goodness for that but er what happened to ettis
16163,oh not too well we drove the ice warriors out of the mines but we couldnt break through to the citadel now the temperature dropping soon theyll be able to come in after us and worse than that the airs getting stale
16164,well be gradually forced up to the upper levels there are ice warriors waiting at every exit
16165,yes the refinery
16166,i left her looking after rima doctor but when i went back for her he was dead she was gone

16183,theyve all gone
16184,oh i can try doctor but many of them have been killed they think aggedors turned against them
16185,well how
16186,then i will show you now watch
16187,not while those primitives have got aggedor working for them time for a word with the doctor i think

16190,surrender now or ill step it up

16264,half right oh please do try to pay attention doctor
16265,right so there they all were in the cellar chanting away like billyo and all of a sudden this giant spider appeared and jumped on luptons back

16272,oh and did you just happen to stumble across the planet and find this crystal accidental like
16273,the mind you mean it could drive someone mad
16274,but it could be used for evil purposes
16275,so if the giant spiders on metebelis three wanted that crystal back
16276,hey wait

16441,doctor i have every respect for your concern for ecology but really one squashed dandelion
16442,well i suppose it was stepped on
16443,funny thing is they left a lot of valuable and top secret stuff behind heres a list of all they actually took
16444,so what are we looking for
16445,and what sort of something is it human
16446,well whatever it is how do we find it
16447,huh

16456,well doctor what are we dealing with invasion from outer space again
16457,enemy agents
16458,so where does that leave us
16459,well i suppose that narrows the field a bit do we know anything else about these people
16460,where do i start looking for this precious conspiracy
16461,an enormous robot over seven feet tall
16462,itd have to be someone theyd accept someone with the proper scientific qualifications
16463,i could wear a disguise
16464,would you kindly put those papers down sir
16465,that folder is private and confidential
16466,there are many years of
16467,oh rubbish i checked all those calculations myself
16468,bless my soul
16469,this new solar battery will provide an endless supply of pollution free energy at a fraction of the present cost and they havent the wit to see it
16470,yes you know ive explained it to them over and over and over again till im blue in the face
16471,you be quiet young man you know ever since the days of galileo
16472,and copernicus scientists have had to
16473,oh its out of the question you said he refused to harm you didnt you yes well i gave him my own brain pattern he has my principles my ideals
16474,there was a triple security thermolock on that safe made from casehardened dynastreem it was completely disintegrated
16475,but theres nothing that could do that dynastreems indestructible
16476,anyway the neighbours heard a commotion but by the time the police arrived it was all over the safe was empty
16477,joseph chambers cabinet minister he had certain special responsibilities in the area of security ive been carrying out a full security check on these think tank people
16478,oh not really they seem to be an exemplary lot just one oddity quite a few of them were members of something called the scientific reform society
16479,oh a little tin pot organisation founded years ago it wants to reform the world on rational and scientific lines you know the sort of thing harmless bunch of cranks if you ask me recently
16480,doctor what are we going to do or shall we leave it all to miss smith
16481,really well were covering a number of fringe organisations and im sure well find a place for you somewhere between the flying saucer people and the flat earthers
16482,i suppose it all seems very elementary to a scientist of your standing doctor
16483,im afraid i must disappoint you doctor
16484,we had to dismantle it
16485,after the visit of your friend miss smith it became unstable she introduced it to concepts it was not equipped to deal with
16486,we decided it would be safer to follow professor kettlewells original instructions
16487,you might find that difficult brigadier but i wont stand on formalities search by all means if you wish
16488,would you forgive me
16489,philips will show you the short cut back to your car
16490,director this is doctor sullivan from the ministry
16491,yes all right doctor all right so where is the robot
16492,i see well i must be off got to try and persuade the minister to let me raid think tank what are you going to do oh no dont tell me more thinking
16493,wait for us well go together
16494,you are the doctor
16495,please confirm your identity there must be no mistake you are the doctor
16496,you are an enemy of the human race i must destroy you please do not resist i do not wish to cause you unnecessary pain
16497,i must serve humanity and never harm it
16498,no you are an enemy you must be destroyed
16499,no mister benton i did not
16500,how on earth
16501,a few months ago the superpowers russia america and china decided upon a plan to ensure peace all three powers have hidden atomic missile sites all three agreed to give details of those sites plus full operational instructions to another neutral country in the event of trouble that country could publish everyones secrets and so cool things down well naturally enough the only country that could be trusted with such a role was great britain
16502,they could set off every atomic missile in the world mister benton
16503,you mean he could use the information to blackmail the world do things our way or we light the blue touch paper
16504,we think theyve been using this scientific reform society as a front doctor and ive just heard from mister benton here that miss smith and professor kettlewell have just gone off to try to get into one of their meetings
16505,he brings with him the symbol of our movement the creature whose intelligence and power make him a fitting emblem for our scientific new order
16506,shes a spy deal with her
16507,dont just stand there you idiots get him
16508,for years i have been trying to persuade people to stop spoiling this planet doctor now with the help of my friends i can make them
16509,and have them escape its too late to be squeamish professor
16510,well doctor
16511,then all that business about being knocked on the head and pushed in the cupboard
16512,but how can they if they start a nuclear war theyll go up with the rest of us
16513,well take him with us hell be a useful hostage
16514,well this is the place an atomic shelter designed and built by the think tank people back in the cold war days
16515,put her with the other one
16516,of all the cheek theyve got troops there
16517,thats not me doctor someones trying to get through on our frequency
16518,right prepare to advance
16519,yes
16520,and what do you propose to do with that
16521,no no you mustnt
16522,they may be going to surrender
16523,well ive brought along something that will deal with it
16524,whats the range and power of that weapon doctor
16525,and knock out anything we send against it
16526,you dont stand much chance you know
16527,all right
16528,i have killed the one who created me
16529,move
16530,we were all pretty busy inside sir mopping up the rest of that think tank lot we noticed the robot was gone when we came out and everyone assumed that someone else had got it
16531,well we thought we thought shed gone home
16532,youre sure there is a connection
16533,why sarah
16534,still nothing sir were spreading the search radius wider and wider but the bigger the area to cover the harder it gets
16535,whats that
16536,well when professor kettlewell was here talking to miss smith he said the robot was made of some kind of living metal he even said it could grow
16537,yes and he went on about some kind of metal virus something that attacked the living metal
16538,well something like that anyway i just wondered if we could
16539,oh im sorry it was probably a daft idea anyway
16540,mankind is not worthy to survive once it is destroyed i shall build more machines like myself machines do not lie
16541,this is lieutenant sullivan sir the doctors rather busy at the moment
16542,its shut itself inside the bunker with miss smith
16543,this any good
16544,curiouser and curiouser
16545,exactly
16546,it left her up on the roof
16547,well ive sent for the artillery and the raf are on their way

16625,right
16626,what
16627,what cant we reach
16628,bad luck jolly good try though
16629,sorry mind you if i had a cricket ball id jolly soon knock that switch

16633,all right
16634,ready
16635,look at my shoes
16636,what is it
16637,doctor i havent the foggiest notion what youre on about
16638,i say what about the armoury
16639,well ought we do you think
16640,i saw something moving
16641,im positive i saw something move
16642,it wasnt a trick of the light i saw something moving
16643,a slug
16644,that size impossible it couldnt have got through this grille
16645,eh
16646,shes obviously not in here
16647,no im not
16648,repository for what
16649,yes but whats it all for
16650,i say couldnt be some sort of survival kit could it
16651,yes you know the sort of thing they shove in lifeboats and things
16652,am i really
16653,missing
16654,i say what a place for a mortuary
16655,reverse id hardly call it a nursery
16656,what
16657,well when youve seen one corpse youve seen them all
16658,dead as a doorknocker
16659,sorry to contradict you doctor not a flicker of life
16660,there are no metabolic functions at all i mean look at him now even in the deepest coma the hair and fingernails continue to grow the epidermis
16661,ten thousand years
16662,doctor are you serious the entire human race
16663,where are we going now
16664,just a minute doctor are you trying to tell that this is where its all going to end in here
16665,but theres only a few hundred corpses er bodies in here i mean whats happened to the rest of humanity some global catastrophe
16666,doctor
16667,look
16668,perhaps its some kind of mould
16669,and that trail we saw in the corridor
16670,dust that er grille thing was a dust extractor and then we opened the door after umpteen years and caused a bit of a draught
16671,what are we checking for exactly
16672,doctor
16673,we cant help her now
16674,there must be something we can do whats would a resuscitation unit look like
16675,well its dead anyway
16676,what is it
16677,i hardly had a chance to look for one
16678,a bit beyond me im afraid
16679,doctor look
16680,yes i think she is
16681,hey look cant i do that for you independent sort of bird isnt she
16682,yes but shes
16683,oh explain yourselves
16684,sorry
16685,my name is vira i am a first medtech
16686,well shes among the chosen now isnt she
16687,of value shes a human being like ourselves what sort of questions that
16688,your comrade is a romantic
16689,she will either survive or die the action of the antiprotonic is not predictable
16690,battlefield i hypoid in classicals but you dawntimers have a language all of your won
16691,joke oh yes there was not much joke in the last days
16692,that is not possible the earth is dead
16693,the solar flares destroyed all life on earth
16694,our scientists calculated it would be five thousand years before the biosphere became viable again
16695,shock
16696,the systems have no capacity for failure
16697,is it from space how did it get here
16698,still no change doctor
16699,doctor
16700,theres a technical fault in the bionosphere
16701,it must be corrected if his heart stops now theres nothing i can do
16702,i say that was quick      doctor
16703,move away
16704,touch that switch and ill atomise you
16705,earth is ours
16706,by deactivating the main solar stack
16707,but theres no response at all
16708,oh doctor
16709,look are you all right
16710,who
16711,we overheard him on the intercom thing saying something about checking the solar stacks
16712,are you sure youre all right
16713,strange how theyve given us the run of the ship why doesnt vira try and stop us
16714,how do you mean
16715,right doctor but not a difficult on you can easily be eliminated
16716,i saw a pathetic attempt at sabotage the observation port is damaged
16717,turn about we will return to the cryogenic section
16718,im sorry i saw something standing there
16719,temporary neuroocular confusion
16720,noah come back
16721,something has happened to his mind there was a power fault during his revival
16722,no no he gave me an order
16723,but he is our commander
16724,what
16725,no
16726,its not advisable for you to try and escape
16727,you know sarah i bet you theres the equivalent of a dinghy missing
16728,oh whats that
16729,membrane
16730,wheres it from
16731,that thing
16732,i dont understand
16733,eumenes one of our frigates
16734,doctor are you saying that that slug thing
16735,yes but how did you know
16736,you mean dunes knowledge
16737,dont make jokes like that doctor
16738,what did he mean theyre in his mind
16739,he talks to himself sometimes because hes the only one who understands what hes talking about
16740,of us
16741,my duty is to supervise the revivification
16742,what is your intention
16743,but i cannot leave until the last of our technical section have awakened
16744,right
16745,keep back i said
16746,time
16747,noah and i were pairbonded for the new life
16748,look oh its okay its dead
16749,what are we going to do with it
16750,quite a lot i think but you need a blooming entomologist for this thing
16751,can we help
16752,then we will commence the main phase lycett rogin
16753,theyre going to start the main phase
16754,that is my decision now take your operating station
16755,noah said we should expedite the revivification programme and get our people to work
16756,seventy two hours for complete revivification another twenty four to evacuate the ark
16757,we must try
16758,doctor the fate of all humanity might be decided within the next few hours
16759,you have an alternative plan
16760,we might destroy them
16761,very well stand down
16762,some external fault shall i check the stacks
16763,curious lung structure doctor look at it
16764,what is it
16765,you mean the way plants make oxygen
16766,judging by the size of his mandibles this chap doesnt live on plankton
16767,noah spoke of a great blackness rushing in he meant space but how did he know
16768,yes but what do you want
16769,what are you going to do doctor
16770,its forbidden to alter those circuits i need the neural cortex amplifier not for long dont worry
16771,doctor what are you trying to do exactly
16772,really
16773,ive never heard of that
16774,now what
16775,that is highly dangerous
16776,the power could burn out a living brain
16777,i cannot permit it the shock might kill you
16778,yes why take the risk
16779,yes but do you have to be the one
16780,yes doctor
16781,what do you mean
16782,hes joining his mind to the wirrn he could remain a part of it forever
16783,wait come away
16784,doctor
16785,no you cant i wont let you
16786,doctor youre going to be all right
16787,doctor dont doctor doctor
16788,doctor
16789,they want to destroy us
16790,how many of them will there be
16791,a hundred we wont stand a chance how can we fight a hundred of those
16792,electricity how
16793,we found the queen in the cupboard
16794,not from here doctor wed have to run cables from the control centre
16795,noahs waiting out there put one foot inside the transom and youll be dead
16796,were trapped
16797,he helped design the systems
16798,oh ho thats clever
16799,oh well i never liked it here anyway
16800,it always sets my teeth on edge
16801,all power systems are self repairing
16802,the oxygen pumps have stopped
16803,well suffocation is not the most unpleasant death
16804,where are you going
16805,youre forgetting noah
16806,since then we have drifted through space searching for a new habitat the ark is ours it must be ours
16807,you know nothing we live in space but our breeding colonies are terrestrial
16808,i already have all dunes knowledge high energy physics quantum mechanics every ramate in the next hatching of wirrn will possess the sum of your races learning that is why you must die
16809,doctor its taken you long enough to get here i was worried stiff
16810,again
16811,im ready to go doctor
16812,well look why dont we all just pile into the tardis
16813,yes a sort of spaceship thing in there plenty of room for all of us
16814,i cant
16815,ah well that settles us
16816,jelly babies
16817,how can we stop them
16818,like an electric fence
16819,doctor
16820,how can we do that
16821,doctor will you listen
16822,it wouldnt work doctor if they have dunes knowledge theyd simply turn it off again
16823,that would take a long time those switch boxes are nonconductive
16824,i was just wondering about the transport ship that noah mentioned
16825,four granovox turbines that ship can generate twice the power of the ark
16826,the only trouble is how do we run a cable from the ship to the cryogenic chamber if its in the open theyll cut it
16827,i reckon she might just squeeze through doctor
16828,come along sarah stick at it  sarah
16829,oh doctor
16830,i can manage i dont need your help thank you
16831,ow
16832,go away
16833,what conned again youre a brute
16834,yes
16835,right
16836,has it gone do you think
16837,theres been no sign of them in this part of the ark
16838,i think so i cant hear anything now
16839,or what
16840,yes but were safe here arent we
16841,oh doctor
16842,those things are so venomous theyll never give up
16843,why have they turned the power back on
16844,what does vira say  doctor
16845,humans require two mass pounds of oxygen a day to stay alive doctor we wirrn can live for years without fresh oxygen if you refuse to surrender we shall shut down the oxygen pumps    wirrn
16846,i am the swarm leader i guarantee your safety the wirrn will spare your lives but leave the sleepers for us
16847,oh just a warning blast how are things with you    harry
16848,i dont know if its my imagination but it seems to be getting stuffy in here
16849,doctor the wirrn have space walked round the ark and have broken into our cargo hold    vira
16850,are you coming or staying
16851,what are you going to do doctor
16852,you know whatll happen when you cut that lock
16853,you dont want trouble with the space technicians union doctor
16854,doctor wheres rogin
16855,oh doctor youre safe
16856,something else
16857,he must have known that that would happen noah deliberately neglected to set the rocket stabilisers
16858,i must get my people back to earth now that ive lost the transport ship i shall have to rely on the matter transmitter
16859,itll be a long operation it can only convey three people at a time
16860,to earth
16861,it isnt anything serious
16862,heres your coat
16863,well the brigadier did tell me to stick with you doctor and orders is orders
16864,well i wont be alone for long life is returning to the ark and soon to the world
16865,ah doctor
16866,i feel a bit like a morse message slightly scrambled
16867,er doctor
16868,i can see youre busy but what about sarah
16869,help me
16870,rightyo
16871,ahem

16883,vural im the leader of this party
16884,first saw him creeping about that circle
16885,he killed him
16886,you say you came here by transmat beam
16887,theres no transmat beam on this planet the earths been junked
16888,so you better start telling the truth or you night find things getting a little rough
16889,from where
16890,you dont expect us to believe that
16891,because nerva doesnt exist thats why theres no such place
16892,everybodys heard of the lost colony
16893,like what
16894,too right
16895,galsec
16896,of course we are
16897,right how long have they been in deep freeze on nerva
16898,and you woke up before the others
16899,clock expert
16900,shut up erak
16901,you got any proof
16902,yes thats what we thought until we got a distress call from around here
16903,one of our galsec freighters went missing we er we picked up a distress call and came down for a looksee soon as we stepped from the ship it was vapourised nine of us were stuck here
16904,and we reckon that that circle of yours has got something to do with it
16905,no
16906,why
16907,go on
16908,how do you reckon to help us
16909,listen if you are one of the old people we�re not taking orders from your lot while you were dozing away our people kept going and they made it we�ve got bases all across the galaxy now you�ve done nothing for ten thousand years while we made an empire you understand
16910,roth    erak
16911,doctor the pits this way
16912,i found your sonic screwdriver doctor the pit

16914,no hed already gone by the time the machine came
16915,what
16916,ja ja alien alien you understand
16917,hes been tortured badly by the look of it hes terrified of everyone now especially his old crewmates
16918,what is

16929,i did nothing i merely resurrected those things which lay buried in the depths of her pathetic little mind she was a victim of her own fear and now your turn
16930,doctor i thought you were both dead
16931,fortuitous
16932,yes doctor
16933,well hes killing people hes on some kind of ghastly experiment look what hes done to sarah

16954,oh
16955,thats taken care of one of them but what about the rest of the invasion fleet waiting to blast us out of the galaxy
16956,
16957,dont trust those transmat beams they never work too good
16958,ah welcome doctor
16959,oh come doctor not with our techniques we time lords transcended such simple mechanical devices when the universe was less than half its present size
16960,continual we pride ourselves we seldom interfere in the affairs of others
16961,you doctor are a special case you enjoy the freedom we allow you in return occasionally not continually we ask you to do something for us
16962,daleks
16963,we foresee a time when they will have destroyed all other lifeforms and become the dominant creature in the universe
16964,wed like you to return to skaro at a point in time before the daleks evolved
16965,or affect their genetic development so that they evolve into less aggressive creatures
16966,alternatively if you learn enough about their very beginnings you might discover some inherent weakness
16967,youll do it
16968,theres no need for that doctor
16969,youre here this is skaro
16970,we thought it would save time if we assumed your agreement
16971,a time ring it will return you to the tardis when youve finished here theres just one thing
16972,be careful not to lose it that time ring is your lifeline good luck doctor
16973,doctor doctor
16974,yes where are we this isnt the beacon
16975,i say thats gunfire
16976,doctor its getting closer
16977,doctor doctor look
16978,nothing can be done for this chap
16979,part of his uniform is made of animal skins and yet the combat jacket is a modern synthetic fibre
16980,playing rock music
16981,what
16982,where are we going
16983,what is it
16984,what
16985,i cant see anything
16986,what is it
16987,dont move your foot
16988,yes im trying to sarah back up sarah
16989,no doctor youll have a better chance if i hold it firm
16990,dont you argue doctor now just lift your foot very very gently
16991,my pleasure
16992,its like a big bubble
16993,what large enough to cover an entire city
16994,why are they fighting with old fashioned things like barbed wire and land mines if they can build something like that
16995,a different sort of uniform from that other chaps
16996,same mixture of ancient and modern though
16997,war of attrition eh only backwards at this rate theyre going to finish off with bows and arrows
16998,its pretty solid isnt it some kind of service tunnel i suppose it might even lead into the dome
16999,gas
17000,respirators quick
17001,so the thals have come down to recruiting mutos have they turn out your pockets
17002,take a good look in a few weeks were going to change the shape of that map forever well wipe the thals from the face of skaro
17003,what
17004,youve had one warning about your insolence
17005,when victory is ours well wipe every trace of the thals and their city from the face of this land we will avenge the deaths of all kaleds whove fallen in the cause of right and justice and build a peace which will be a monument to their sacrifice our battle cry will be total extermination of the thals
17006,youll never get out of here alive
17007,even you mutos know the difference between thals and kaleds
17008,never felt fitter doctor
17009,never
17010,where do you want me to take you
17011,only mutos live in the wastelands
17012,i hope sarahs all right
17013,if youve a friend up there they wont last much longer
17014,if youll wait in my office nyder ill be a few minutes
17015,youre civilians i see
17016,alert all guards two thal intruders in the command complex
17017,were trapped
17018,now what
17019,what
17020,that was a lucky escape
17021,this is yours
17022,what is its function
17023,oh really it is not of thal manufacture
17024,ive heard davros say there is no intelligent life on other planets so either he is wrong or you are lying
17025,and davros is never wrong about anything
17026,they could be mutos nyder intelligent mutos whove developed a technology
17027,mutos are the scarred relics of ourselves monsters created by the chemical weapons used in the first century of this war they were banished into the wastelands where they live and scavenge like animals
17028,we must keep the kaled race pure imperfects are rejected some of them survive out there
17029,prisoners belongings
17030,what
17031,step into the security scan
17032,let me point out to you that you have no rights whatsoever i have full authority to torture and kill any prisoner who does not comply absolutely with my orders that is your first and last warning
17033,scan detects power source located below prisoners left elbow remove object from prisoners left wrist
17034,lets not make a fuss doctor
17035,two prisoners at checkpoint awaiting orders
17036,sit down
17037,im with the science division
17038,that depends if you dont answer my questions i shall hand you back to the military they take a pride in loosening tongues now where did you get these things
17039,if i didnt know better i should have to assume that these were made by some intelligence on another planet
17040,it is an established scientific fact that in the seven galaxies only skaro is capable of supporting intelligent life
17041,indeed
17042,well when you passed through our security scan our instruments ran a complete check on your blood and chemical make up encephalographic patterns and so on physiological compositions and so if you are from another planet
17043,theres nothing nothing conforms to any known life on this planet apart from external appearances
17044,who are you where are you from
17045,then tell me
17046,our session will have to wait davros is coming
17047,hes our supreme commander when he calls a full meeting like this he obviously has something of the greatest importance to tell us
17048,if i may have your attention for some time i have been experimenting with the mark three project details of modifications will be distributed later however i am anxious that you should see immediately the remarkable results that i have achieved and to that end i have arranged this demonstration
17049,what
17050,youre mistaken its a mark three travel machine
17051,you will be punished for insubordination in the meantime you may question the prisoners until first light after that they will be used to resume the experiment this meeting is ended
17052,you all right
17053,what happened
17054,thatll keep their experts tied up for weeks
17055,about this bunker
17056,it is underground isnt it
17057,what are they doing down here
17058,a sort of think tank
17059,im sorry if they hurt you i lack the courage to interfere
17060,yes now you used that word earlier it had never been heard before and yet only an hour ago davros announced that henceforth his mark three travel machine would be referred to as a dalek now how could you have known that
17061,yes i am concerned and there are a few other who think the same as i but were powerless
17062,yes
17063,that is our future
17064,okay ill pass the word to the others
17065,well knowing our ultimate form davros had to devise a travel machine the dalek
17066,well i must there are a few in the kaled government who still have the power to act if they knew the truth they would end davros power close down this bunker finish the elite
17067,but im not allowed in the city security here is absolute
17068,the entrance is barred and theres something else davros early experiments were with animals some of the things that he created were horrific and theyre still alive
17069,look if anything at all should happen
17070,come on
17071,looks as though weve made it
17072,quick its pulling me in
17073,get that thing off
17074,magna peloris
17075,latin
17076,why is it always me who puts a foot in it
17077,i think so
17078,we must look out for sarah shes out there somewhere
17079,doctor will you please tell the councillors what you have told me
17080,that was a very impressive speech doctor
17081,lets hope its convinced them
17082,let me finish please it has been agreed that an independent tribunal will investigate all work that is being done at the bunker
17083,it has also been agreed that pending the investigation davros experiments will be suspended
17084,and i promise you doctor if your allegations are borne out all work at the bunker will be closed down
17085,thatll be her
17086,they think theyll win the war with it what they dont know is that no matter how powerful their rocket it cannot penetrate our protective dome only a matter of months ago davros perfected a new substance which has the strength of thirty foot thick reinforced concrete
17087,one of my agents could lead you into the service shafts underneath the thal city
17088,right ill give you a map showing how to reach the rocket silo area
17089,well doctor looks as though weve got to cross the wastelands again
17090,whats davros doing here in the thal city
17091,doctor somehow weve got to warn mogran and the other kaled leaders
17092,harry doctor
17093,oh i am now listen weve got to get out of here the thals are going to launch this rocket
17094,what are you going to do
17095,right
17096,sevrin you come with us
17097,nevertheless someone has and his treachery has resulted in the total extermination of our people
17098,did you have friends in the kaled city
17099,what will you do now
17100,daleks
17101,davros no youre wrong it was he who told us how to destroy the kaled dome his only interest is in achieving peace
17102,youll never convince my people of that davros is a hero
17103,i must go under the general amnesty youre free to leave whenever you want
17104,what are they
17105,are those the daleks
17106,oh there was no need to go that far when our leaders saw they were beaten they should have surrendered
17107,but there must be some wholl escape some survivors
17108,what
17109,what chance do we have against them
17110,yes
17111,alone
17112,doctor
17113,hello
17114,whats the matter with you
17115,well of course i knew youd try to get back into the bunker through the cave
17116,because they took the time ring
17117,ill do what i can
17118,yes
17119,do you think theyll get away with it
17120,what was that
17121,good ill meet you there as soon as i can
17122,are you sure doctor it doesnt look familiar
17123,ill never eat oysters again
17124,its obviously why davros discarded them
17125,listen ive been down tunnels before and ive just had a rather nasty thought
17126,yes suppose somethings waiting for us in there
17127,welcome back
17128,i have read the initial reports of your interrogation the suggestion that you have travelled through space and time was utterly dismissed by the computer analysis
17129,precisely i however i am perhaps more flexible though the power of such travel is beyond my scientific comprehension it is not beyond my imagination why did you come here
17130,why
17131,then my daleks do go on they do survive
17132,fascinating
17133,i could do it
17134,you have seen my daleks in battle
17135,and do they win do they always win
17136,if as you say they become the supreme creatures of war how can they lose how can they fail
17137,yes but tell me how do the daleks fail
17138,what mistakes do they make you will tell me
17139,you will tell me
17140,nyder let me tell you what is going to happen you will answer my questions you will answer them carefully and precisely the instruments to which you are wired are particularly sensitive they will detect instantly any attempt to lie
17141,now you will tell me the reason for every dalek defeat with that knowledge i will programme them with that knowledge they will know their errors and how to avoid them with that knowledge there shall be no defeats we will begin
17142,but you can you will tell me you will tell me you will tell me
17143,now future errors will be eradicated defeats will become victories you have changed the future of the universe doctor
17144,impossible it is beyond my control the workshops are already fully automated to produce the dalek machines
17145,evil no no i will not accept that they are conditioned simply to survive they can survive only by becoming the dominant species when all other life forms are suppressed when the daleks are the supreme rulers of the universe then you will have peace wars will end they are the power not of evil but of good
17146,it is an interesting conjecture
17147,the only living thing a microscopic organism reigning supreme a fascinating idea
17148,release me
17149,dont touch that switch
17150,it controls my life support systems i could not survive thirty seconds without them
17151,destroy the daleks never
17152,even if i do this there will be no escape for you
17153,this is davros elite unit seven will go to the incubator room all survival maintenance systems are to be closed down the dalek creatures are to be destroyed
17154,theyll be disarmed and held in custody until weve presented our ultimatum to davros
17155,perhaps because he knows its futile there are too many of us
17156,well even so therell still be too many for him
17157,no point in telling you to rest i suppose
17158,because without it well never get off this planet but where is it
17159,you and they will find out exactly what i mean all in good time now carry out my orders
17160,theyre explosives arent they
17161,why what are you going to use them for
17162,genocide
17163,the daleks are in there
17164,well how do i see
17165,youre not going in there are you
17166,you dont want me to come in do you doctor
17167,doctor doctor are you all right
17168,what are you waiting for
17169,to destroy the daleks you cant doubt it
17170,but it isnt like that
17171,were talking about the daleks the most evil creatures ever invented you must destroy them you must complete your mission for the time lords
17172,then why wait if it was a disease or some sort of bacteria you were destroying you wouldnt hesitate
17173,he did but he asked only one thing that he might be allowed to address a meeting of all the elite scientific and military
17174,yes but a vote will be taken its a foregone conclusion therell be a complete landslide against any further development of the daleks weve won
17175,the meetings about to begin will you come
17176,the time ring isnt here doctor
17177,production of the dalek can continue we can destroy the genetically conditioned creatures and allow the mutation to follow its own course our race will survive if it deserves to survive but let it have all the strengths and weaknesses that we have compassion and hate let it do good things and evil but we cannot let it become an unfeeling heartless machine that is our choice now we must decide
17178,doctor
17179,no more kravos will you betray me
17180,i think we ought to find out
17181,kravos i saved your life once in your chest is a tiny instrument which i designed it keeps your heart beating will you now turn that heart against me
17182,davros has lost i am getting away while i can
17183,why didnt you just join the other side
17184,its put away in a safe in davros office
17185,down here
17186,perhaps hes telling the truth
17187,well
17188,er how about this
17189,what
17190,what about the daleks that are already operational
17191,that means we can leave then
17192,wont take long it doesnt give them much time all right carry on
17193,doctor
17194,why is it going on so long
17195,what
17196,were not far from the main entrance if we can get through the next section well be safe
17197,what are you going to do
17198,let us come with you
17199,the incubator room were you able to do anything
17200,what
17201,goodbye harry
17202,thank you sevrin
17203,thank heavens for that weve made it havent we
17204,well in these past few weeks yes
17205,doctor
17206,the tardis isnt here
17207,hasnt arrived yet
17208,i say doctor do you want this ring thing
17209,yes
17210,oh well id rather like to have it
17211,hes dead been dead some time
17212,a week or two id say theres very little sign of putrefaction though
17213,but he was just sitting against the door as though hed collapsed
17214,unless what
17215,is it jammed
17216,you mean we cant get any further
17217,look are you sure were in the right place doctor i mean this doesnt look like our ark
17218,how can you tell
17219,so this is before the time of the solar flares when the earth was evacuated
17220,oh im not even going to think about it ill only get a headache
17221,what is it
17222,can you reach
17223,like so
17224,wait wait through quick
17225,right then well have to check every section come on
17226,well the tardis doesnt seem to be here either does it
17227,now who are you howd you get here
17228,follow them come on move
17229,get back hes got the plague this is the only way to deal with it
17230,there is no treatment all we can try to do is stop the infection spreading
17231,you cant allow it
17232,commander im afraid youll have to kill these people too theyve brought the plague in here
17233,you say youre doctors did earth centre send you
17234,quite impossible weve had no contact with him
17235,according to our own medical team we have
17236,they didnt have time they were among the first victims
17237,all right you can examine him
17238,turned up fifty years ago thats why this beacons out here a lot of the great circle freighters havent got it on their charts yet
17239,new phobos originally but kellmans renamed it voga
17240,kellman he set up a transmat why
17241,whats coming back to you
17242,but surely doctor cybermen died out centuries ago
17243,youd better take over the control room lester
17244,you mean the two puncture marks
17245,you mean venom
17246,poor man
17247,how is there an antidote
17248,now where are you going
17249,if the doctor scented a rat commander hell find one
17250,we saw    man
17251,that sounded like sarah whats happened
17252,shes got the plague
17253,is this thing still dangerous doctor
17254,where are we going
17255,er yes ive seen you do it
17256,has it gone wrong doctor
17257,sabotage
17258,but who
17259,doctor shes not going to last much longer
17260,lester you take that section ill look round the transom
17261,of course we werent we were just
17262,how
17263,we found this in his cabin
17264,hes lying
17265,what are you doing with that
17266,no
17267,i dont know what you mean
17268,look
17269,stop it for heavens sake do something
17270,all right all right its around my neck take it
17271,very well ill send a detachment to deal with them
17272,isnt it working
17273,after the cataclysms of our ancient past sheprah weve survived down here only by regarding all outsiders as hostile
17274,but who  doctor
17275,excellent kellman you have done well the humans will carry the explosives into the shaft
17276,there will be no gold voga is to be utterly destroyed and this time we shall not fail
17277,the heart of voga is almost pure gold gold is hostile to our function therefore kellman was asked to preserve three animal organisms for this purpose
17278,hmm oh to the gold mines its time that vorus accounted for himself
17279,the matter is of no interest to you
17280,you are incorrect
17281,you speak unwisely we are destined to be rulers of all the cosmos
17282,because of voga and its gold if humans had not had the resources of voga the cyber war would have ended in glorious triumph
17283,that is why voga must be destroyed before we begin our second campaign
17284,more efficiently than animal organisms that is why we will rule the galaxy
17285,put that down
17286,kellman wants power he will be ruler of this solar system when we have conquered it
17287,cyberbombs the most compact and powerful explosive devices ever invented
17288,cybermen do not subscribe to any theory of morality in war doctor our calculations indicate that two bombs placed in the central fissure of voga will fragmatise the planet
17289,correct it is as well to keep that thought in your minds
17290,fourteen minutes is considered adequate
17291,yes doctor your progress will be followed by radar any attempt to deviate from the planned course will be immediately detected and the bombs exploded by means of these manual controls
17292,countdown has commenced you doctor will leave first
17293,you mean as a weapon
17294,do you believe all this guff about giving us time to escape
17295,so what do we do now
17296,the rest of you come with me we must speak to vorus
17297,what is your idea
17298,well lets go and take a look
17299,im getting a bit old for this sort of thing
17300,had any more bits of that idea doctor
17301,then what
17302,yes i think so
17303,im sorry doctor im a bit whacked
17304,theyre giving a bit
17305,these buckles cant be opened until the cybermen beam the release signal
17306,well naturally
17307,er well i suppose i must have done yes
17308,im not sure doctor when i last saw her she was trying to get back to the beacon
17309,yes you see we thought you were still up there and she naturally wanted to warn you about the rocket sorry i can see youre not with me
17310,cybermen thats right terribly bad on names got the cybermen up on the beacon so that theyd be sitting ducks for the vogans rocket only the vogans havent finished the rocket yet so things have gone a bit wrong
17311,doctor weve got about nine minutes
17312,yes
17313,what with
17314,well then lester agreed right
17315,and to you
17316,annihilated vapourised it is good
17317,weve got about five minutes
17318,yes creep as close as we can then chuck this stuff into their chest units
17319,come i will speak to them
17320,it has failed why
17321,we are grateful to you human for saving voga
17322,excellent
17323,an alternative
17324,yourself you mean alone
17325,youve already done so much why should you risk your life again in this way
17326,bah
17327,fifteen minutes then doctor but no longer
17328,whats that
17329,oh yes
17330,doctor
17331,doc
17332,sorry
17333,tardis listen doctor the cybermen are loading this beacon with bombs theyre going to smash it into voga
17334,doctor
17335,its good to see you
17336,yes
17337,theres no point filling it with gold dust it wont attack the cybermen
17338,what was that
17339,engage hyperdrive
17340,you did it
17341,hurry
17342,doctor
17343,oh doctor
17344,the beacon is approaching voga at ten thousand light units it is time for us to leave
17345,you two are especially privileged you are about to die in the biggest explosion ever witnessed in this solar system it will be a magnificent spectacle unhappily you will be unable to appreciate it
17346,how long have we got doctor
17347,the vogan rocket
17348,oh its no good doctor they wont budge
17349,really well you must have tied it wrong no wait a minute youre right theyre loosening
17350,just let him think
17351,what
17352,yes but were still heading for the biggest bang in history
17353,what does that mean
17354,were going to crash
17355,oh good
17356,hi
17357,oh all go isnt it
17358,how do you know
17359,and hes used it
17360,mayday mayday mayday mayday
17361,hi
17362,oh welcome back doctor
17363,that doctor is a kilt
17364,oh do you think so
17365,what an odd man rather mediaeval in his ideas
17366,what an absurd idea
17367,all three rigs were in this area therefore it seems to us
17368,three serious disasters doctor
17369,this is an emergency
17370,doctor the destruction of these rigs is a complete mystery do you want more men to die
17371,correction concrete boots thousands of tons of it those babies are meant to be unsinkable
17372,we spent a fortune proving the waverley field geologically sound everything is constantly checked for stability winds tides the constant moving of the sea bed
17373,each time a rig has disappeared
17374,difficult to be sure it was at night the radio picked up some strange sound but as far as we know the sea was calm and empty
17375,hi whats that er if youre interested the brigs on the quayside watching wreckage being brought ashore
17376,hmm thought thatd interest you hes being very secretive if you ask me hes wasting his time oh yes might as well forget about security in tullock landlord heres got second sight
17377,what is that thing youre fiddling with
17378,not again ben nevis ben nevis are you there are you there over
17379,no
17380,no hes still in shock the bullet grazed his skull
17381,is he all right
17382,yes but time is the last thing we have doctor another rigs just been destroyed
17383,the ben nevis rig fifty miles west of the prince charlie forty men aboard completely vanished
17384,exactly the same first of all radio blackout and then that extraordinary sound now mister huckles going mad
17385,ill stay with harry then i can call you if theres any improvement
17386,yes yes of course
17387,part of the wreckage from the prince charlie its been curiously marked look
17388,plaster of
17389,okay doctor
17390,doctor do you mind telling us exactly what youre doing
17391,orthodontology
17392,teeth doctor you cant be serious
17393,look lets get this straight are you trying to tell me that the rigs were chewed up by a set of giant molars
17394,its all right doctor sullivan youre quite safe your worries are over now youre going to be very well looked after
17395,no no no
17396,well why do you think harrys still in danger from something
17397,no i was only gone for a few minutes when i got back hed disappeared but the window was open
17398,no doctor sullivan was beginning to talk i thought she ought to hear she was nowhere to be found in the corridor so i went over to hut four
17399,doctor
17400,right
17401,i found the receiver hanging on its cord i thought it odd at the time
17402,only me
17403,through there is the decompression unit for our divers but its always kept locked
17404,ill try the dispensary
17405,whats that noise
17406,in your terminology human the ultimate weapon
17407,would be mere pin pricks we have converted the skarasen into an armoured cyborg of devastating power nothing can stand against us nothing
17408,find the others tell them weve found them
17409,what worked
17410,what worked doctor
17411,i just dont get it everyone in the village is affected they seem to have been drugged or something
17412,gassed
17413,will he be okay
17414,it just doesnt make any sense
17415,yes i am
17416,we have the power to turn ourselves into replicas of your unpleasant form whenever it is necessary
17417,i didnt see it miss smith and i can tell you i didnt go looking
17418,yeah well if theres anything i can do
17419,ah doctor there you are what was i doing on the floor
17420,exactly what could have caused injuries like that doctor
17421,but it was there
17422,yeah you know what worries me is how they whoever they are whatever they are knew we had it
17423,meaning i think were being watched
17424,a spy youre not suggesting that one of us is really one of them
17425,like harry
17426,a bug
17427,doctor it moved i saw it move
17428,is that its signal
17429,and that means this thing whatever it is is on its way
17430,i see well id better get our machine gun set up
17431,then what do you suggest
17432,youre taking an awful risk doctor you dont know how fast this thing can move
17433,doctor hey hey you all right
17434,cyborg then you identified the creature
17435,who the cyborgs
17436,the signal seemed to be coming from loch ness doctor if thats possible
17437,ready for what
17438,your grace i really dont think we should just walk in unannounced
17439,most of the staff have left and gone to work for the oil company i cant say i blame them
17440,perhaps youll explain this intrusion
17441,i see you have some reason for calling
17442,well
17443,yes
17444,i do believe youre serious
17445,doctor are you a party to this militaristic nonsense
17446,loch ness is seven miles from the coast are you suggesting it walks overland without being seen
17447,no doctor loch ness is fifty feet above sea level
17448,ive never heard such nonsense are you seriously suggesting that the creature commutes between here and the north sea whenever it feels like it
17449,controlled by whom
17450,youre all utterly unhinged must be aliens with wireless sets
17451,half these books are devoted to the subject of the monster thereve been reported sightings since the middle ages now youre saying that aliens have been living under the loch for centuries
17452,something to do with the oil perhaps
17453,absolute fantasy
17454,well it still doesnt seem a good enough reason to start attacking oil rigs doctor
17455,yes oh they have splendid where right well come over straight away bentons got one of those creatures cornered doctor
17456,yes
17457,listen you stop trying to keep me out of things
17458,pity he didnt tell us what he was up to
17459,sorry im not with you
17460,doctor youre not suggesting his grace is involved in this
17461,the place is deserted
17462,and thats not all the duke we met is an imposter hes one of them
17463,hello
17464,what do you mean what about us two
17465,fire
17466,at least theyll know we mean business
17467,immediately commander
17468,what do you mean
17469,the plan has not changed
17470,complete touchdown procedure      broton
17471,that is close enough sever contact the skeletar will bring it to the target from that range
17472,you admire our technology human
17473,better than this
17474,it is necessary to activate a body print every few hours otherwise the original pattern dies and cannot be used again
17475,one
17476,perhaps
17477,you like asking questions
17478,phase one is already complete
17479,other zygons are on their way when our planet was destroyed in a recent catastrophe a great refugee fleet was assembled
17480,exactly doctor it will be many centuries before the fleet arrives in that time the whole of this earth must be restructured
17481,polar icecaps must go the mean temperature raised several degrees thousand of lakes with the right mineral elements constructed i shall recreate my own planet here on earth
17482,that is my intention human labour and zygon technology the task is challenging but not impossible
17483,lethbridge stewart speaking oh absolutely understood madam no public announcement yes madam discreet action discreet but resolute
17484,it is well i underestimated his intelligence but he underestimated the power of organic crystallography come it is almost time for me to leave
17485,who are you
17486,yes where the blazes am i
17487,what are you doing
17488,this one
17489,is that broken enough
17490,you tell us
17491,doctor
17492,well
17493,nicely done doctor thats the end of the zygons eh
17494,close to the thames huh
17495,ive just remembered when i spoke to the pm earlier she was about to leave for stanbridge house and thats on the river
17496,the fourth international energy conference the placell be full of vips from all over the world its a meeting of crucial importance
17497,thats right i am
17498,three and a half minutes doctor and still no sign of broton in the conference hall
17499,catering section and river terrace
17500,maybe somebody should tell the energy congress
17501,doctor
17502,right ferguson with me
17503,harry youre right
17504,well lets hope so
17505,its going back under the surface
17506,home
17507,the sun was in my eyes now where is this contraption of yours
17508,thats the tardis
17509,just a minute doctor i thought you couldnt do that
17510,i think ill stick to intercity this time doctor
17511,er
17512,all right providing we do go straight back to london
17513,how long have we been travelling
17514,you promised me wed be back in london five minutes before leaving loch ness
17515,oh youre trying to wriggle out of it
17516,your promise
17517,oh i see whats gone wrong this time
17518,because you always get rude when youre trying to cover up a mistake
17519,come on where are we
17520,how many
17521,thats a distress call
17522,where
17523,which way
17524,you dont know where we are
17525,that is not what i meant
17526,i mean what planet
17527,its your decision controller ill get equipped for descent
17528,i dont know just suddenly felt so odd as though my mind left my body
17529,yes
17530,yeah whats that youve found
17531,looks like were too late
17532,cant we have some lights
17533,that would account for the weak signal
17534,what
17535,so were still in the solar system
17536,i wonder what happened here
17537,and died before help arrived
17538,so what are we going to do
17539,well you can get on with that now ill fetch the spectromixer
17540,why not i know the way
17541,the key
17542,right see you
17543,baldwin
17544,yes but any signal would have been monitored by our receivers
17545,shut up
17546,naturally any force of alien infiltrators is going to operate under cover of dark a full and immediate confession would save you great discomfort
17547,so that seems to narrow the killer down to our two aliens prepare to execute them
17548,through the window
17549,right ill go and look for him
17550,its how i felt before in the jungle as though i was being drawn from my body
17551,what was it
17552,all right
17553,whats the matter
17554,where are we going
17555,that was lucky
17556,time
17557,ah you mean its getting light
17558,doesnt it like daylight
17559,what was that an elfin spirit of the forest
17560,oh at least we know we cant get lost
17561,who
17562,perhaps thats why he took up writing
17563,i am well aware of your high position in the science authorities professor but this is a military expedition with military objectives the manual says hostile alien forces must be searched out and liquidated that operation is now in hand
17564,is this where the thing lives
17565,uh oh doctor
17566,a pool
17567,raise your hands over your heads search him
17568,put your hands over your heads
17569,search them both
17570,bring the prisoners forward
17571,you are prisoners and you are charged with diverse acts of war against the subjects of morestra
17572,silence
17573,you will not respond to questions with counterquestions
17574,silence you will have a chance to speak doctor
17575,yesterday you were found with the body of one of our scientists last night one of our guards died and you were seen kneeling over him can you explain this
17576,other universe
17577,i dont think so let him finish
17578,salamar my mineral samples are aboard it is getting dark prepare for the return journey
17579,that was the purpose of my expedition
17580,get them out of here ill deal with them later
17581,do you ever get tired of being pushed around
17582,we could get in the tardis and disappear
17583,how do you mean
17584,the big bang
17585,whats that
17586,mmm they were sort of a brownish colour
17587,what are you doing what are you doing
17588,its the compression units theyre preparing to launch
17589,get out there and stop it
17590,it wont work
17591,its too dangerous
17592,all right tell us what you know about that
17593,that was the whole purpose of my expedition
17594,but its gone
17595,are you saying we cant take off
17596,but we need those mineral samples
17597,our sun is dying by taking material from this planet we can refuel it and save our civilisation
17598,so if we jettison those canisters we can take off
17599,but how do we communicate that intention
17600,but
17601,doctor
17602,launch the oculoid tracker i want his movements followed
17603,come on
17604,doctor
17605,youre all right were taking off
17606,its all right theyve been dumped your promise as a time lord well what happened
17607,well try what did you do enter another universe and have a chat with it
17608,all the canisters were removed
17609,whats that
17610,is there enough there to hold us back
17611,drag is still increasing i dont understand it
17612,oh why
17613,but that means well be marooned in space
17614,vapourised what do you mean

17621,yes doctor and we want to examine that space machine of yours
17622,oh great thats the thanks you get for helping people
17623,that was a ruse to gain our confidence his real intention is to destroy us
17624,there are other civilisations as desperate as we are for new energy sources my discoveries on zeta minor would be of immense value to them
17625,its crazy the thrusters are still at full power
17626,what are you talking about
17627,nothing can do that
17628,you mean the ship will be dragged back to zeta minor
17629,youre diverting attention from whats really causing the trouble you you and whatevers in that machine of yours something thats draining the power from this ship
17630,argh
17631,shut up open it
17632,open it        doctor

17648,it worked
17649,no

18011,all the same the sooner we get away from here the better
18012,so everything weve seen has been a fake
18013,but the village
18014,ive er been listening to your conversation
18015,i hear youre impressed by the thoroughness with which this operation has been planned
18016,oh no doctor no shortly i shall leave for earth the kraals will project me through the space time warp and my ship will make a normal reentry into the earths atmosphere
18017,ah yes doctor but i have recently reestablished radio contact with earth they know about the stabiliser failure that sent me into orbit around jupiter they know how ive rationed my provisions particularly drinking water my recycling experiments already every telescope on earth is trained on that little patch of sky where my xk5 will reappear
18018,exactly doctor yes and all brilliantly planned by styggron the chief scientist of the
18019,yes i know i know but the kraals have promised me that no humans will be harmed as long as they obey the ultimatum thats been prepared you see the kraals are going to take over the northern hemisphere and live in peace i have their word for it
18020,before my spaceship lands the space shells with the androids inside will be launched now if anyone sees them theyll just be taken for meteorites you see and then the androids will take over the key positions in the defence complex and the way will be clear for marshall chedaki to bring in the main invasion fleet without a shot being fired
18021,oh yes yes well they thought you were a danger
18022,im sorry i have to go now now trust me i know what im doing
18023,good now take the tray to the detention cell
18024,what are you going to do
18025,electrocute him
18026,food and drink
18027,youre to come with me
18028,where are you taking him doctor
18029,harry i have little time
18030,yes doctor
18031,in a moment doctor the knowledge and experience of your entire life will be transposed into our data bank
18032,while you are making your small contribution to kraal culture i shall be on my way to destroy the humans that you have so often defended this time you will be powerless to help them
18033,earths resources are limited they cannot be wasted supporting an inferior species
18034,nothing so crude as fission weapons the androids will disseminate a virus it will cause a contagion so lethal the earth will be rid of its human population within three weeks then it will burn itself out and the world will be ours
18035,crayfords rocket will prove an effective quarantine chamber i shall remain inside until the virus has done its work then i shall signal marshall chedaki to bring in our invasion fleet
18036,what
18037,in eight minutes doctor the analyser will have completed its recording unfortunately i shall not be here to turn it off your brain tissue will expand under the stimulation until eventually your skull bursts i imagine it will be a most disagreeable death
18038,doctor doctor come on come on wake up doctor come on doctor please come on wake up
18039,shush
18040,im sarah
18041,sarah
18042,this is the disorientation centre

18050,oh no dont tell me i dont want to know
18051,how
18052,oh
18053,why
18054,and what are we going to use for air
18055,why dont they work
18056,so providing we dont burn up on reentry and arent suffocated on the way down well probably be smashed to a pulp when we land
18057,our plan its your plan
18058,how long before we start all this
18059,i swear theyre slowing down
18060,oh doctor dont do things like that

18140,good
18141,the power of the sisterhood
18142,doctor you have but a little time left will you waste it prattling nonsense or confess your guilt
18143,before you die
18144,at the next sun that is agreed
18145,confess that you were sent here to steal the elixir of life and your death will be made easy
18146,morbius is dead
18147,the time lords destroyed morbius for his crimes here on karn
18148,morbius was executed for leading the rebellion his body was placed in a dispersal chamber and atomised to the nine corners of the universe
18149,the sun appears i give you the last chance doctor to confess your guilt
18150,this powder can spare you from the anger of the flame without it you will die in torment so confess
18151,with your spoken confession the time lords can never deny they plotted against the sisterhood
18152,nevertheless
18153,and now the elixir no longer forms you time lords want for yourselves the little that remains
18154,the sacred flame dies
18155,it dies
18156,take him the flame must feed
18157,you had the chance of mercy doctor
18158,the harm is done the sacrifice is defiled
18159,be silent
18160,the doctor spare his life
18161,make the offering
18162,stop them stop them
18163,you go to the laboratory and get it ready and ill fetch the arm

18197,you have been condemned to die
18198,then why did you come to karn if not to steal
18199,nothing happens on karn without our knowledge
18200,what are you suggesting
18201,oh that name again i tell you i saw his execution i saw his body placed in the dispersal chamber nothing of morbius not the smallest atom still exists
18202,i believe so there were many on karn then they came from all across the galaxy to attend the trial of morbius
18203,morbius betrayed our secret until then only the time lords knew of the elixir now we have to remain constantly on guard against the entire cosmos
18204,innocent
18205,what
18206,your arrogance is limitless doctor ive only to raise my finger for you to be put to death
18207,the flame of life
18208,when the flame dies our sisterhood dies it is ordained
18209,i have served the flame for centuries there is nothing to be done
18210,send the guards to the outer chamber
18211,it is even lower
18212,always
18213,do not try to understand mysteries beyond the reach of the mind
18214,what do you mean
18215,you speak in riddles doctor the time lords were glad enough of the elixir
18216,and what trap are we in
18217,nothing here ever changes
18218,what is that
18219,the sacred flame we are saved high one
18220,doctor
18221,oh doctor
18222,doctor youre too late
18223,yes or plastic i dont know anyway you can actually see that brain inside it like a goldfish bowl
18224,no look im serious doctor its horrible
18225,where are we going where are we going
18226,what happened where is he
18227,yes
18228,i thought you were dead morbius has got to be stopped
18229,his brain is only functioning on the motor level i hadnt finished the operation and youve got to help me if i dont find him soon then the consequences could be incalculable
18230,yes his hated for the sisterhood is his deepest emotion at the instinctual level at which his minds now working
18231,dead
18232,yes
18233,theres no damage as far as i can see
18234,there might be a slight contusion of the corpus callosum i dont know until i get it back
18235,simple animal instinct doctor morbius wouldnt want to aggravate the sisterhood at this stage lift him up with me
18236,ive got to get him back before the anaesthetic wears off
18237,what do you mean
18238,and if the doctor is right high one he will have given it the brain of our ancient enemy morbius
18239,doctor ive spent my lifetime
18240,oh no ill do it
18241,oh i just had the most terrible dream
18242,first of all i was blinded then i was attacked by a great claw thing looked like it was made from butchers leftovers and then i was
18243,how did you know
18244,you were what happened to mister allsorts
18245,thats a switch
18246,was he really that dangerous
18247,uh huh
18248,sonic screwdriver
18249,there must be something we can do its not like you to give up i mean solon has got to be stopped hasnt he
18250,i knew you would
18251,hydrogen cyanide
18252,what
18253,ah ha hcn
18254,so what do we do now drink ourselves to death what are you looking for if you tell me i can help you is it big is it small what is it

18258,okay
18259,how do we tell if its worked
18260,it hasnt worked
18261,how many seconds in a month
18262,an ingenious idea doctor but ineffectual your poison affected only solon i have the lungs of a birastropthe
18263,solon designed this body for efficiency not for its appearance to be free again is all that matters
18264,the time lords will not oppose me again nor the sisterhood when it is learnt that i morbius have returned from the grave my followers will rise in their millions
18265,what
18266,you will be the first to die
18267,my brain functions perfectly
18268,what test
18269,i am a time lord of the first rank what are you
18270,very well doctor if that is how you want to die i accept your challenge
18271,whats mindbending
18272,it will doctor i morbius do not play games
18273,here take it perhaps the doctor was right there should be an end
18274,maren
18275,it was ordained
18276,we have
18277,thank you ohica  the doctor gives sarah the key and she opens the tardis
18278,what are they
18279,personally i dont think you can help us
18280,these pictures have baffled all the experts the only reasonable explanation seems to be that the pod is from some extinct species of plant
18281,name one
18282,my dear doctor if youve seen anything like that before you must have a very powerful telescope
18283,i thought you were the expert in these matters well as a matter of fact thats one of the things our expedition is trying to discover it was found fairly deep in the permafrost say twenty thirty thousand years under the ice
18284,what
18285,my superior sir colin thackeray has a daily video link ten minutes of satellite time
18286,youre leaving immediately
18287,hello so you made it welcome to the loneliest spot on earth you must be the doctor
18288,we were expecting someone much older
18289,sarah jane smith the young doctors assistant
18290,yes
18291,ill get you something hot to drink in a tick er are you okay dressed like that you dont seem to notice the cold
18292,he seems to be conscious but he hasnt spoken a word since last night
18293,well thats the amazing thing ive been trying to keep him warm but its dropping hourly
18294,his body temperature is forty six his pulse rate is eighteen a minute im no medical expert but on those figures he should be dead shouldnt he
18295,good grief it wasnt like that an hour ago
18296,well its difficult to say in these conditions hopefully tomorrow
18297,have you any idea what it can be doctor
18298,i thought you came here to see the pod
18299,thatll be too late hes dying isnt he doctor
18300,i thought you said in the sickbay
18301,changing form
18302,im a zoologist i could prepare a specimen slide if itll help
18303,right
18304,its over here
18305,well that that could be my fault it was frozen stiff when we took it out of the ice i was certain there was still life there i put in under a lamp and it started to expand
18306,doctor doctor what are we looking for
18307,yes and if you told us what you were doing perhaps we could help
18308,how did you will there be any more
18309,what are we going to do with it buy it a truncheon
18310,doctor
18311,take a look at this blood sample
18312,winlett hes barely recognisable its as if hes turning into some sort of a hideous monster
18313,yes but there must be an answer
18314,these arent blood platelets
18315,schizophytes
18316,plant bacteria in someones bloodstream
18317,will they be able to help that man
18318,krynoid
18319,so you recognised it
18320,well what is a krynoid i mean what does it do
18321,in what way
18322,mmm hmm
18323,but thats terrifying
18324,well how did it get through space
18325,so what do we do about winlett
18326,right
18327,you were very lucky lights are few and far between out here
18328,what now
18329,thats horrible horrible
18330,we can do nothing except just watch it happen
18331,well what
18332,what good would that do cant you see the infections all over his body
18333,you say might what you mean is you dont know
18334,and whos going to perform this operation
18335,but im not a surgeon what about you youre a doctor
18336,ill do my best
18337,right
18338,ill take these down to the sickbay and start setting up
18339,i can fix that
18340,youll do it keeler youll do exactly as youre told otherwise well just make the hole a little bigger
18341,did you see his face wheres he gone
18342,i dont believe it you mean to say charles did that

18344,into a krynoid
18345,yes mister scorby in this weather
18346,ready doctor
18347,a fair exchange dunbar you want money and i want that pod
18348,safety measure its a new fuel cell system being tested out here for the first time
18349,look cancel them will you we dont need them any more everythings under control here  radio
18350,i dont think this has been disturbed
18351,no im afraid winlett must have collapsed somewhere
18352,you know i find this very hard to take youre telling me that these things are inimical to the whole of animal creation
18353,how do you know
18354,theres no danger now is there i mean weve got the second pod in the freezer and winlett
18355,the krynoid is very likely frozen stiff under the snow somewhere
18356,ill be with you in a moment i want to check something
18357,facing this way
18358,shut up okay start talking
18359,what happened to him
18360,we gathered that

18363,oh you mean you have a homicidal maniac on the loose
18364,you mean this camp
18365,okay thatll do watch the door now then doctor lets have the truth wheres the plant that came out of the pod

18387,you make these two mystery men sound like fanatics
18388,exaggerate now look i was there we were nearly killed
18389,and if thats true that someone else must be a complete madman
18390,thats correct but doctor i trust youre not suggesting that information was leaked from this bureau
18391,in any case what would be the gain
18392,money
18393,since you seem to have it all sewn up doctor perhaps you can tell us where the pod is now
18394,very well doctor youve made your point all the facilities of this bureau will be placed at your disposal

18949,its all i shall need
18950,oh no doctor this is as kastria was before i built the solar barriers my fellow kastrians may not have been able to maintain the systems that i devised for them but there will be survivors leading miserable existences in the thermal caves deep underground
18951,energy drawn from the core of the planet
18952,the traitors i should have expected
18953,an acid designed to neutralise the molecular bond it is now only a matter of time
18954,oh no doctor i developed the acid there is no antidote
18955,how can you tell
18956,i hope that regenerator isnt far
18957,that way
18958,intruders on level three zero six identified as two aliens one kastrian

19081,he is abusing a legal technicality
19082,forty eight hours doctor
19083,what are you going to do
19084,dont get any ambitious ideas
19085,what about it
19086,miles away

19101,i can tell when i see it take it to records ill have a look at it there i want to know all you can tell me about this master and i warn you know if there is some private feud between you do not try to settle it on gallifrey
19102,if hes a time lord therell be a de on him in the archives
19103,im sorry so sorry
19104,not here in the time lord capitol
19105,nothing castellan there is no record of any time lord ever adopting that title
19106,according to coordinator engin the time lord data extracts cannot be withdrawn without the fact being recorded i thought that yours had been scanned recently but he assured me it was impossible
19107,more that criminal knowhow doctor excitonic circuitry
19108,what is the master like on mathematics
19109,the apc control
19110,amplified panatropic computations
19111,yes trillions of electrochemical cells in a continuous matrix the cells are the repository of departed time lords at the moment of death an electrical scan is made of the brain pattern and these millions of impulses are immediately transferred to the
19112,well to monitor life in the capitol we use all this combined knowledge and experience to predict future developments
19113,for some reason that was not foreseen
19114,what are you talking about
19115,no
19116,yes
19117,maybe but why
19118,doctor i simply cannot believe that anybody could do what youre suggesting how can one intercept a thought pattern from within the matrix itself
19119,you mean a living mind
19120,i couldnt allow that its too dangerous the psychosomatic feedback might kill you
19121,its never been done
19122,lie down
19123,well theyre normally unconscious i think there might be some pain
19124,are you quite sure
19125,you were a fool doctor to venture into my domain
19126,bwahahahaha
19127,water hes going to need water
19128,this is what you will do
19129,ive no data available but his bodys on the point of collapse now low blood pressure shallow respiration carbon dioxide increasing he cant last much longer
19130,get back get back from
19131,where are you doctor you cant win doctor you might as well give up now
19132,only your life doctor your life for my master
19133,no bargains show yourself doctor get it over with do you hear me
19134,very well doctor
19135,ill cheat them yet im not beaten
19136,what
19137,how do you feel doctor
19138,yes youd better rest you took quite a beating in there
19139,who
19140,did you say goth the chancellor
19141,thats why he wanted a quick execution
19142,only service ducts
19143,well a long way down vaults and foundations dating from the old time
19144,is he dead
19145,so doctor you beat us in the end
19146,wanted power wanted to be president
19147,for him the master his plan
19148,met him on tersurus he was dying no more regeneration possible promised me share all his knowledge if i bring him to gallifrey
19149,couldnt fight his mental dominance did everything he asked sorry now
19150,its no use doctor
19151,no
19152,best forgotten of course doctor the charge against you will be dropped
19153,conditional on your leaving gallifrey tonight
19154,good i believe you know something of the masters past
19155,then before you leave you can assist coordinator engin to compile a new biog of him it doesnt have to be entirely accurate
19156,the body castellan
19157,what
19158,immediately castellan
19159,oh doctor could you please be a little more specific
19160,what
19161,but thats something we must all accept doctor
19162,after the twelfth regeneration there is no plan that will postpone death
19163,nothing hes simply an elected time lord usually from some senior position he holds the symbols of office but otherwise hes no different from any other time lord
19164,yes relics from the old time the sash of rassilon the key
19165,well its all in the book of the old time but theres a modern transgram thats much less difficult
19166,you mean now
19167,what is it
19168,and today we tend to think of rassilon as the founder of our modern civilisation but in his own time he was regarded mainly as an engineer and an architect and of course it was long before we turned aside from the barren road of technology
19169,early history is something of a pet subject  woman
19170,what
19171,its an ebonite rod carried by the president on ceremonial occasions but its actual function if it ever had one is a complete mystery
19172,in the panopticon theres a display case of relics
19173,oh thats held by the president that stays in his possession
19174,who
19175,it seems that the master didnt die from natural causes
19176,he killed himself careful its poison
19177,deadly no doubt
19178,what
19179,amazing
19180,ha weakness doctor hate is strength
19181,this time doctor the execution will not be delayed castellan i assure you i am not nearly so infirm as i look now you bring me the sash of rassilon oh yes doctor why else do you think i feigned death when goth failed me it was necessary to more direct means but the sash is wasted on our dead friend dont you think so bring it to me
19182,a stupid remark doctor resistance is futile now
19183,i have suffered long enough from your stupid stubborn interference in my designs now we are coming to the end of our conflict doctor
19184,theyre not dead stunned theyll live long enough to see the end of this accursed planet and for the doctor to taste the full bitterness of his defeat
19185,its gone
19186,well what could i do its only of symbolic value anyway
19187,you really mean it
19188,but the eye of harmony is a myth it no longer exists
19189,its no good we can never move it
19190,the panopticon an old service shaft
19191,its a hundred feet doctor at least
19192,doctor my congratulations youre just in time for the end
19193,take the rod you can take it with you to your grave except that none of you will need a grave
19194,you can do better than that doctor even in extremis i wear the sash of rassilon
19195,yes indeed i am conscious of the debt we owe the doctor but gallifrey has never know such a catastrophe such devastation what will we say
19196,as i believe i told you long ago doctor you will never amount to anything in the galaxy while you retain your propensity for vulgar facetiousness
19197,oh doctor
19198,nine out of ten
19199,you know doctor if you wanted to stay im sure any past difficulties could be overlooked
19200,the barriers are raised doctor
19201,its we who should thank you doctor for destroying the master
19202,oh but if by some miracle he survived the fall into that chasm he was dying anyway
19203,are you suggesting he survived
19204,goodbye doctor
19205,you have until sunrise if you are still within the boundary then you must be thrown to the horda
19206,no go back to the tribe im going now goodbye tomas beware of the devious calib one day hell get so cunning even he wont know what hes planned

19260,find it find it search everywhere
19261,no this way
19262,its too late tell him the attack must not be delayed
19263,thats the evil one
19264,what happened you must be able to remember
19265,there is no other part only beyond the wall
19266,what
19267,we cant
19268,well be torn to pieces
19269,thats what you said last time
19270,that was the hand of xoanon
19271,xoanon has spoken we shall not fail
19272,there wouldnt be much point in praying if he didnt
19273,why did you talk to that tube
19274,neeva
19275,are you certain
19276,yes
19277,what are you talking about

19282,isnt there any way we can warn them
19283,attack
19284,so neeva and andor were lying
19285,ah
19286,that rather depends on what you do to avoid it
19287,we need someones help
19288,the tribe is in desperate danger calib the doctor can help hes the only one who can but we must convince the others hes not the evil one
19289,i dont think youre the evil one and never have i dont believe in ghosts
19290,but if im to help i need to know everything
19291,janis thorn something you havent thought of now stay where you are

19314,conscience
19315,if he can be killed then he is not the evil one because the evil one is a god
19316,the litany says it can be destroyed
19317,if he can be killed then he is a mortal
19318,theyll strike at anything that moves except each other ten of these can strip the flesh from a mans arm almost before he can cry out
19319,the pit is full of them

19480,that one
19481,that one
19482,well thats because its further away
19483,thats silly
19484,whats exciting
19485,but how can we how can the tardis be inside something metal
19486,no not very clearly
19487,you mean you dont know

19504,doctor how do you know theyre not hostile
19505,whats all this for
19506,sometimes you talk like a tesh
19507,it was not well meant are the mechanical men friendly
19508,perhaps there are no people here
19509,because they have no feelings    sv7
19510,oh well the other mechanical man told us to wait  sv7
19511,talkative no doctor he said we must wait here
19512,what escaped then youd better find them and find them quick put every spare robot on it
19513,i am not in any hurry to get myself killed toos
19514,shut up
19515,are you all right
19516,that ones ready to kill i had to restrain him
19517,yes exactly the same and who are you
19518,yes what are you doing here
19519,i should be very careful if i were you
19520,what are you doing on this mine
19521,oh i see a hundred million miles of uncharted desert and you just stumbled across us
19522,yes i suppose its also a coincidence that as soon as you two arrive three of our people are killed well
19523,he was hiding kerrils body in that hopper and got trapped when it was turned on now thats a fact
19524,no the others were strangled why should he be any different
19525,why bother youre a stowaway what could be more suspicious than a stowaway
19526,ever hear of the double bluff
19527,have you quite finished look either one of us murdered them or they did which do you think is the more likely
19528,weve heard quite enough out of you
19529,i will kill zilda
19530,nice of them to leave our arms free
19531,these metal straps they wont budge
19532,the robots bent them as though they were leather
19533,oh hopeless
19534,what are you doing
19535,how long will that take
19536,three weeks
19537,you dont seem to be taking this very seriously doctor

19539,well you move like a hunter watch all the time
19540,never mind about me what matters to you is commander uvanov i know him and i know its only a matter of time before he decides that its a waste of food water and labour keeping you alive
19541,i dont think you did it i know she couldnt have strangled cass not without knocking him out first and theres no sign of that so tell me what you know and ill try to help you
19542,thats your great theory is it well my friend robots cannot kill their prime directive
19543,its impossible its just impossible

19546,his name was chub a government meteorologist i dont know much about him he wasnt part of the team just along to study the storms
19547,i did i heard him scream i came looking it was odd that because he was strangled like the others
19548,he had time to scream
19549,oh we were on a run up to a storm he came to get an instrument package to send up in one of his weather balloons
19550,he was lying there

19553,wait here im going to get the others if youre right about this you cant imagine what itll mean
19554,im on my way  no you wait here
19555,creepy mechanical men

20141,a waste of time i too used to believe in magic but the doctor has taught me about science it is better to believe in science
20142,enough
20143,he was trying to bribe that young keeper to telegraph a message to his brokers
20144,it was the only way i could think of stopping him id have been dishonoured ruined
20145,you mean weve no way of contacting the mainland now
20146,its no more absurd than thinking that i might have
20147,what do you mean
20148,what
20149,in the lamp gallery thats not possible that would mean that this creature can climb sheer walls
20150,no
20151,yes
20152,that was vince he said the boiler pressure has fallen and the siren will not sound
20153,oh no

20156,but that is not possible he was in his room
20157,but he was i saw him
20158,this alien must have great power to change its shape at will
20159,that is why it took the engineer
20160,then there is nothing we can do
20161,well if this creature is a time lord
20162,oh then we have nothing to worry about
20163,no you will easily dispose of this primitive creature doctor you are a time lord
20164,to kill us stealthily one by one doctor
20165,suppose we pretend that we still think reuben is reuben and not the alien then we can get close enough to it and kill it
20166,what is it
20167,does it belong to the alien
20168,to the lamp room
20169,oh but doctor where shall we look for this mognal sigulator
20170,run run
20171,doctor the creature behind us we must find weapons

20173,no longer necessary we can abandon this ridiculous shape
20174,you know our form
20175,we are a rutan scout we are specially trained in the new metamorphosis techniques
20176,that doesnt concern you you are to be destroyed
20177,that is a lie
20178,the glorious rutan army is making a series of strategic withdrawals to selected strong points
20179,your mockery will end with your race earthling when the mighty rutan battle fleet occupies this planet
20180,the planet is obscure but its strategic position is sound we shall use it as a launch point for our final assault on the sontaran rabble
20181,that is unimportant it will serve the cause of our final glorious victory
20182,primitive bipeds of no value we scouted all the planets of this solar system only this one suits our purpose
20183,it is necessary til we return to our mother ship and the mother ship informs the fleet no one must know of our visit to earth
20184,failed we are sending a signal to the mother ship with the power from the primitive mechanism below
20185,its of no importance the ship will home in on the primary signal
20186,all your interference is useless the beam was transmitting long enough for the mother ship to trace the signal
20187,it will come
20188,what could you earthlings possibly do to us
20189,is this advisable doctor
20190,a what
20191,oh yes of course here
20192,how did you hold it back on the stairs
20193,the time for talk is over
20194,where is it have you killed the thing
20195,thats the most horrible thing ive ever seen what the devil is it
20196,was it a sea creature
20197,we are lucky that it fears flame
20198,well there is this doctor

20290,of no importance
20291,now that you have arrived
20292,all that matters is that the reject should be destroyed
20293,and breeding begin
20294,one of us will follow
20295,must not be harmed
20296,hide    doctor
20297,think of the purpose she is a reject she must die
20298,think of the purpose
20299,the purpose is all important
20300,stay the nucleus does not wish to be harmed i shall destroy her
20301,meeker this purpose what is it            nucleus
20302,doctor
20303,doctor what was all that
20304,why not me
20305,the evil one
20306,no doctor please
20307,what are the coordinates doctor what are the coordinates
20308,seven four three
20309,no sir
20310,good evening
20311,ah doctor i see
20312,cataleptic trance
20313,selfinduced
20314,ha why
20315,oh i see you mean that the harder you think the more of a grip it seems to take
20316,oh no i take your point i take your point now my computer here hes
20317,well he seems to think that its noetic in character that means its only detectable during consciousness
20318,im sorry
20319,well if it exists
20320,when was this
20321,hmm
20322,no
20323,oh
20324,well its possible its possible was anyone else exposed to it
20325,coming sir
20326,theres been a crash a shuttle theyve gone to help  k9
20327,then hurry      woman
20328,why
20329,i think im needed elsewhere
20330,its lowe hes got the disease get inside quick ill cover you      k9
20331,ten minutes fifty five seconds
20332,certainly the kilbracken technique is very simple but its a circus trick its of no medical value
20333,now
20334,now you must realise doctor this is not in any real sense a clone but a shortlived carbonbased imprint a sort of three dimensional photograph
20335,help me out
20336,yes doctor contact has been made now i serve the purpose
20337,take me to him
20338,it suits me well
20339,you were mistaken i made use of your escape route through the eye
20340,another mistake and a costly one time lord because now thanks to your dimensional stabiliser i am no longer forced to exist in the micro world to breed and multiply my swarm when it is hatched on titan will no longer be invisible microbes prey to all but mighty and invulnerable creatures invincible the age of man is over doctor the age of the virus has begun
20341,now what
20342,doctor if we get to titan first we can still beat that thing
20343,you mean theres nothing we can do
20344,all senior staff report to reception this is professor marius speaking all senior staff report to reception ah k9 k9 i no longer require you to obey
20345,havent we been through all this before
20346,how did what i have get into your bloodstream
20347,what about the nucleus what about titan
20348,he will follow marius will make sure of that whatever happens faster use all the fuel faster
20349,wheres parsons what happened
20350,i remember lowe coming in and then parsons and then a flash and then nothing did the experiment work
20351,was i taken over
20352,but we found the immunity factor so were safe here for a while what was it
20353,yes
20354,attack the nucleus oh thats dangerous
20355,but will you get to titan on time
20356,how much longer
20357,doctor why dont we just blow up titan nucleus breeding tanks everything
20358,effective isnt it smash it once and for all well
20359,doctor weve done it congratulations there isnt a moment to be lost cultivate c five three one
20360,and
20361,is that all if we can get to titan on time if we can get past lowe and the others if it works when we get it in there if i thought you didnt like killing
20362,then why are you doing all this
20363,doctor the batch is complete
20364,remember i must be protected in the hive the future of the swarm depends on you now
20365,yes
20366,borrow k9
20367,what for
20368,doctor what is it
20369,now whats the matter
20370,thank you k9 well doctor whats wrong why didnt my blaster work
20371,k9s breaking up my blasters finished what are we going to do
20372,well if you think thats a good idea
20373,or not good luck doctor you know we should have done what i said
20374,your futile attempt has failed as we knew it would now you will join the nucleus
20375,you have no choice
20376,you will join the swarm to be consumed to become part of our purpose
20377,did you kill it
20378,what never mind doctor ive found the answer
20379,knife them in the neck
20380,what are we going to do
20381,is it gone
20382,all of it
20383,what do you mean it was a good idea of yours it was my idea
20384,to blow it up
20385,goodbye doctor and thank you for everything youve done for us
20386,i think k9 has taken to you oh actually i have to return to earth shortly and you could do me a great favour if
20387,yes
20388,professor marius would not be very pleased
20389,will he be all right
20390,i can call k9 he if i want to you call the tardis she
20391,never you do ive heard you you called it she just a moment ago and another thing it is quite clear to me that you cannot control this old machine either
20392,leela said
20393,then why ask
20394,dont cry about it
20395,complete and constant what is it whats wrong
20396,whats happening

20532,rock salt
20533,yes right
20534,yes
20535,did you say that about twelve million years ago on a nameless planet which no longer exists evolution went up a blind alley
20536,natural selection turned back on itself and a creature evolved which prospered by absorbing the energy wavelengths of life itself
20537,it ate life all life including that of its own kind
20538,so when the time lords acted it was too late the fendahl had already come here
20539,then it got itself buried but not killed
20540,are you saying that skull created man

20602,these taxes they are like sacrifices to tribal gods
20603,then the people should rise up and slaughter their oppressors
20604,if we are caught up here there is a fine of five talmars or a week in the correction centre
20605,it is an offence only the executive grade is allowed in the light of the suns
20606,he is trying to open the tardis
20607,quick quick
20608,we must get away
20609,death is easy perhaps youve never been in the correction centre citizen
20610,where are we going
20611,well he ran first
20612,why did you run
20613,perhaps everyone runs from the tax man
20614,i know the secret way to the undercity you see my father was an e grade work unit he cleaned the walkways all his life he learned the secret
20615,im gratified citizens but there may be danger
20616,well at night when the sun has gone
20617,but that is not possible every planet must have a night
20618,there are six
20619,well everyone knows that each megropolis was given its own sun
20620,yes
20621,somewhere beyond this point there is a little grating in the ground
20622,i didnt think it would be as bad as this i must turn back
20623,we caught these three snooping around the service subway
20624,theres no life on the other planets
20625,show courtesy to my rank or ill cut your skin off inch by inch
20626,where are they from he looks like an ajack
20627,with a face like his he would not dare
20628,let me get him doctor i could cut his heart out
20629,why did you come here then
20630,the d grade
20631,get him up
20632,a handy girl doctor
20633,you two may be of more use to us than i thought
20634,itd better do a little task for you doctor
20635,heres a consumcard we got of an ajack its made out for a thousand talmars
20636,what do you think
20637,none of us could us it we dont look like ajacks
20638,do you know how to use a consumcard
20639,at the consum bank on subway thirty seven
20640,do not go doctor
20641,youll die
20642,i couldnt breathe down there
20643,what is it
20644,there it is doctor
20645,dont try to speak yet my friend valerium gas affects the throat
20646,where are you youre in the correction centre this is the induction therapy section that means they sensitise areas of the brain and clear the neural pathways so that when we arrive in physical we feel the full benefit it intensifies pain a thousand times
20647,they brought you in just as the trumpets were sounding second workshift about an hour ago
20648,what are you doing
20649,curiosity
20650,yes i was an executive grade at the chemical plant in charge of pcm production i got curious about some of the other products
20651,well there were some tablets labelled for official use only for the gatherers and the other company staff i wondered what they were so i took some
20652,i felt completely different as though id never really been alive until then
20653,of course i did i suppose they noticed the difference in me and kept watch the megroguards came for me during my last sleep time
20654,pentocyleinicmethylhydrane
20655,you know something about chemistry
20656,no no it eliminates airborne infections
20657,cordo you are the bravest man here come
20658,its a high pressure system doctor the pcm is volatilized through the vapour towers and the air conditioning system
20659,we dont count anymore were just material for processing
20660,im sorry our acquaintance was so brief doctor it has been a pleasure meeting you
20661,im afraid after this nobody remembers much
20662,i wonder how long itll take them to fix that
20663,this is the one untie him
20664,gatherer hade wishes to see you
20665,he ordered your release
20666,ah citizen doctor welcome come in sit down
20667,citizen doctor an unusual name
20668,indeed there are so many wurgs and keeks in megropolis three i sometimes wonder how my distinguished colleague gatherer pile manages to keep track of you all
20669,well its here on your consumcard
20670,the cause of your unfortunate experience of which i trust there are no ill effects
20671,and also to apologise for any inconvenience to err is computer
20672,would you care for a leaf
20673,no raspberry leaves i have them specially imported they contain natural chlorophyll very healthy
20674,is that so
20675,of course in primitive times on old earth they ate prodigious quantities of vegetable matter without any apparent harm to their system
20676,mmm im quite a student of antiquity many people alive are not even aware that our species originated on old earth
20677,its true they learn nothing in the preparation centres
20678,ah well of course there is a religious view though ive always inclined to the expansionist theory natural progression tell me citizen doctor are you planning to stay long in megropolis one
20679,well while youre here you must get about a bit after all it is the first and oldest city on pluto theres much of interest to see
20680,oh dont let me detain you any longer i know you visiting executives have a very busy schedule an agreeable meeting
20681,listen
20682,we heard youd been taken
20683,what tricks this
20684,shes gone
20685,we heard you were in the correction centre she went off with some crazy idea of getting you out
20686,dont threaten me doctor the gatherer doesnt give anyone money he takes but he doesnt give so youd better have a good story
20687,now youre going to answer my questions doctor
20688,why did the gatherer give you this money
20689,you know what i think
20690,now listen doctor we can either do this the easy way
20691,the gatherer gave you a thousand talmars to bring to us
20692,now this is going to be your bad day doctor if you dont start talking
20693,the deal you and the gatherer made a deal
20694,now the irons another minute doctor youve got one more minute
20695,this is your last chance
20696,youll have to do better than that doctor
20697,talk doctor

20699,two
20700,four
20701,five
20702,hold it mandrell
20703,no no hes not
20704,two guns what will we do with two guns against all those guards
20705,its crazy talk rebellion no one would support you
20706,ive thought of that doctor the pcm is the source of the companys power but without explosives theres no way of stopping it entering the vapour chambers
20707,two hundred and five centigrade
20708,there are eight of them all round the city
20709,but all controlled from one point
20710,how
20711,but i think it could work and what have we got to lose
20712,well put doctor
20713,anythings worth trying if only we could win just think if we could beat the company
20714,whats your plan doctor
20715,what scanner system

20733,the temperature in the heat exchange is down to seventy centigrade shall we keep it at that level doctor
20734,at seventy
20735,shush
20736,the heat exchanger would blow up take half the city with it
20737,no it couldnt be done you can see what the atmospheric pressure in there is it would flatten you
20738,you couldnt do it
20739,and inside youre dead its impossible  k9
20740,bisham
20741,k9s done it look

20791,six suns to be fueled and serviced
20792,alas no there is nowhere else that is economic this branch will close
20793,when the suns have run down yes a matter of a few years without fuel theyre not a good workforce in any case many of our other operations produce a much higher return with less labour
20794,we have tried war but the use of economic power is far more effective
20795,it will be quelled business will continue as usual
20796,i know the facts
20797,then they will die

21068,doctor

21070,no only the arrogance with which you present it
21071,which obviously failed
21072,you make me regret teaching you anything at all
21073,then you must trust your instincts
21074,ill do what i can to persuade the cardinals to accept you as their president
21075,politeness dictates
21076,no that was an unfortunate oversight
21077,i meant no disrespect
21078,on what particular subject
21079,you had that at your fingertips last time we met
21080,not i the then chancellor
21081,the council ratified my appointment
21082,there was no president and the presidentelect was elsewhere
21083,and until you have been confirmed and inducted as president i do not need your leave to do anything
21084,as soon as possible
21085,after all chancellor a request is a request and its only a matter of time
21086,oh its simply a formality
21087,the presidents quarters are inadequate
21088,we are not his lackeys we are time lords of the supreme council i am chancellor
21089,i am a cardinal then that at least
21090,in what style sir
21091,with the merest hint of simian empire

21103,but lead
21104,its a very difficult substance to control
21105,only a few have mastered the art
21106,yes
21107,then keep your fine clothes and your useless baubles and keep your presidentelect also
21108,then gold usher will formally introduce you to the matrix
21109,there is no just about it the matrix is the sum total everything all the information that has ever been stored all the information that can be stored the imprints of personalities of hundreds of time lords and their presidents their elected presidents that will become available to you it will become a part of you as you will become a part of it
21110,but you know this already once before you have entered into the amplified panatropic computer
21111,the apc net is only a small part of the matrix
21112,more power than anyone in the known universe yes
21113,that is your duty
21114,do you swear to uphold the laws of gallifrey
21115,do you swear to follow in the wisdom of rassilon
21116,do you swear to protect the law and the wisdom

21128,what exactly are you playing at excellency
21129,you know very well what i mean
21130,i thought that was a quality you didnt admire
21131,well you could never deceive me when you were my student at the academy you havent changed and neither have i but this is rather more than a student prank isnt it
21132,isnt that a little melodramatic even for your vivid imagination
21133,you can rest here we can continue after youve had your rest and the alien has been caught and expelled
21134,good men
21135,yes sir
21136,she must be in there these old type forties had a complex trimonic locking device    andred

21147,regrettable oversights on the part of one of my guards
21148,immediately eminence
21149,but excellency
21150,the transduction barrier has failed we are being invaded
21151,and when was that
21152,so you knew about this all the time you knew about this before your induction
21153,and all you know is in the matrix
21154,you really disappoint me doctor i expected better of you
21155,he always has a plan
21156,you have no right
21157,regarding what supremacy
21158,the matter is in hand
21159,i believe so
21160,congratulations doctor you show great promise in the application of power you could be a first grade dictator
21161,what did you say
21162,doctor
21163,how long will it take you to find the great key
21164,then i am wrong and i will face the consequence are you coming  rodan nods and takes leelas outstretched hand
21165,you wished to see me your excellence
21166,as you can see
21167,to the last detail
21168,they are the finest to be had in the whole thessorian empire
21169,as you can see
21170,but the strain must have been intolerable
21171,the president need apologise to no one
21172,the president
21173,how accurate is your data
21174,the vardans can travel along wavelengths of any sort
21175,in the sense that any electrotemporal field aids communication are they telepathic
21176,but a leadlined room would shield you from them
21177,yet you maintained a partial shielding unaided
21178,and you did not think that i could shield myself
21179,tea
21180,tea is camillia in dried form
21181,well whats that got to do with the threat from the vardans
21182,or even the president
21183,oh yes if im as transparent as good oldfashioned glass
21184,that barbarian garden how can she be safe there
21185,well decide about that when weve heard their story this onell need rest and shelter before she can tell us anything
21186,just so i know how much i am liable to give away
21187,yes
21188,i am a cardinal
21189,it is i who should apologise
21190,you have no authority under the constitution to order the chancellor to do anything
21191,this is monstrous president
21192,never i will not submit to these creatures i am a time lord a
21193,you will be responsible for him
21194,guards escort the chancellor to his rooms remain on guard
21195,he is foolish if he causes trouble we shall destroy him and you also
21196,more we havent begun yet when we are certain that we have complete dominance over your people then we shall reveal our requirements to you
21197,the time is not right first you must complete the arrangements for the subjugation of your people
21198,it is my duty sir to serve the president at all times i will do whatever you wish
21199,of course sir peaceful cooperation is a much more fruitful course
21200,oh thank you sir
21201,yes of course sir and perhaps youd like a list of all known trouble makers at the same time
21202,is there anything else i can get for you sir
21203,what colour would you prefer sir

21214,there is no choice
21215,there is sir
21216,yes thats an excellent idea sir
21217,very well we approve but leaders such as chancellor borusa shall be kept here in confinement
21218,yes sir i will start at once
21219,your progress so far has been quite satisfactory
21220,we are not ready yet
21221,your next task will be to dismantle the quantum force field around gallifrey
21222,it has to be possible
21223,you will find a way
21224,then we are agreed we shall fight
21225,right we must get him away from his invader friends and away from kelners tame bodyguard then we can strike
21226,but sir i cant i must stay with you castellans orders

21248,i mean the matrix
21249,the matrix has been invaded
21250,why havent you explained this to the supreme council
21251,can you trust a machine

21255,yes
21256,what
21257,what are you going to do

21272,accompany him
21273,exactly
21274,expedite immediately i repeat that under the circumstances i assume complete authority the president is to be shot on sight
21275,no keep still
21276,alert alert i detect an illegitimate frequency tracer alert full alert    k9
21277,whats the matter
21278,but how have we won we fought no one but a few guards
21279,all right
21280,taking what up seriously
21281,what does
21282,what does proficient mean
21283,yes your excellency
21284,that is so excellency
21285,er
21286,is it over
21287,do you know these things
21288,i am commander stor of the sontaran special space service
21289,no
21290,your description fits that of one called doctor
21291,sir
21292,i call no one sir except my battalion leader
21293,thousands the glorious sontaran army reckons its numbers in hundreds of millions find doctor
21294,a means to an end only the ultimate goal is victory
21295,victory over all
21296,what was that
21297,what
21298,i am
21299,no
21300,what are these sontarans
21301,then i shall kill him
21302,do you know
21303,well tell me
21304,over here
21305,prodigious
21306,oh it was nothing
21307,thats right
21308,silence
21309,i thought youd never get here
21310,break it down
21311,a heavy easily fusible soft malleable base metal such as lead is not the best defence against heatintensive weaponry
21312,fortunately someone had the good sense to reinforce the structure with a titanium based alloy
21313,a suggestion of mine yes a holding device only i fear
21314,is not one of my duties to protect the president
21315,oh this is not for you your companions however
21316,of your own free will
21317,shall i kill him now
21318,hes no friend to threaten you like that
21319,this is useless not even marked return with the troopers but make sure they are fully armed otherwise i will negate you now go
21320,the next logical step i agree
21321,would appear logical
21322,i agree
21323,theres no need for formality excellency
21324,i have no idea believe me excellency
21325,yes
21326,oh no im not leaving you again
21327,no every time i do you get into trouble
21328,all right come on i said come on
21329,i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about
21330,you ask for the impossible
21331,you already have it
21332,that is a myth a legend
21333,leave me leela save yourself they need you go
21334,i know that
21335,should it be
21336,then you should remember your training in detachment
21337,yes chancellor not while you have the great key
21338,take them
21339,none of this is in the matrix
21340,the chancellor
21341,there could just be a way
21342,of course there are no new orders stop him
21343,the great key is quite useless against elementary particle assault
21344,the chancellors personal forceshield  unfortunately the batteries seem uncomfortably low
21345,so what would you suggest we do
21346,run
21347,so undignified i havent run like this for centuries
21348,naturally
21349,oh with luck
21350,im a technician
21351,yes
21352,vip suite
21353,no entry
21354,yes
21355,you cant give the great key to an alien
21356,you trust her
21357,then i shall look after it
21358,come
21359,rodan
21360,as well as i can excellency
21361,quasitronics
21362,well its a simple field study exercise
21363,a glimmer
21364,what
21365,link your control to the main defence mechanism
21366,my battalion commander insists on immediate entry unless i obey i shall die before i die you will die time lord
21367,of course i am
21368,crimps
21369,i do five four two lever
21370,doctor
21371,vinkelgruber
21372,a vinkelgruber
21373,no now what were you saying
21374,i believe i can bypass the safety circuits
21375,load of junk
21376,this
21377,there you are look theres the arrow head arrow wings arrow shaft why its a perfect sontaran formation
21378,doesnt matter the defence screens are up again
21379,shush as long as this tardis remains secure you control the defence screens
21380,what is happening
21381,but thats impossible only a time lord could do that
21382,doctor doctor
21383,rodan
21384,bring the relevant probe with you
21385,in the bathroom
21386,yes in the bathroom
21387,well its bigger than it looks your tardis
21388,i didnt how do you know
21389,listen doctor you gave me the wrong directions
21390,how could you possibly expect me to follow those directions
21391,he has the great key i want him captured intact but unharmed after that i will deal with him personally
21392,shush where are we
21393,where are we going
21394,has he got a workshop on board  doctor
21395,completely
21396,we have
21397,yes clean it up a bit you know redecoration
21398,sontarans
21399,dont get excited
21400,i said dont get excited
21401,doctor
21402,you are getting excited
21403,doctor weve been here before
21404,d�j� vu its a common thing among time travellers
21405,we have been here before
21406,doctor shes absolutely right
21407,we just travelled this route ten minutes ago
21408,you said you wanted a rest
21409,why you cant use a perfectly modern seven oh six model ill never understand
21410,doctor
21411,we have been here before
21412,so i cannot destroy the tardis and the doctor cannot escape stalemate      k9
21413,little k9
21414,what is it
21415,we will do battle on your own ground doctor
21416,of course
21417,yes
21418,yes
21419,coming up
21420,what did you say
21421,oh where are we going
21422,then you will be well rewarded lead on
21423,im quite comfortable thank you
21424,yes
21425,yes
21426,yes
21427,its not just a question of breeding surely
21428,i think so
21429,i wish youd stabilise your pedestrian infrastructure president
21430,sorry about this im not going to be much good to you now
21431,yes
21432,well as well as i did last time
21433,dont worry doctor ill find my own way
21434,it is a utilitarian unit he would disguise it with beauty
21435,i have other duties
21436,have you defeated them
21437,workshop
21438,yes its finished
21439,no
21440,but what is it
21441,thats impossible
21442,no chancellor forward
21443,no no hes in the panopticon
21444,doctor this grenade will give me a lot of pleasure
21445,yes it is a glory to die for a glorious sontaran empire
21446,yes and all of the time lords with it
21447,yes doctor but it is a small price to pay if we cannot control the power of the time lords then we shall destroy it goodbye doctor  the doctor demats stor there is a blinding flash and we next see the doctor lying on the floor of the panopticon the demat gun is gone and only the great key remains
21448,oh doctor
21449,your excellence
21450,have you forgotten your induction
21451,the vardans
21452,the sontarans
21453,doctor you saved gallifrey
21454,he remembers nothing of it it is the wisdom of rassilon
21455,im staying
21456,i hope that
21457,doctor
21458,i will miss you
21459,will he be lonely k9  k9
21460,doctor you have been chosen for a vitally important task
21461,it concerns the key to time you know of the key to time
21462,it is no myth
21463,it consists of six segments and these segments are scattered and hidden throughout the cosmos when they are assembled into the cube they create a power which is too dangerous for any being to possess
21464,there are times doctor when the forces within the universe upset the balance to such an extent that it becomes necessary to stop everything
21465,for a brief moment only
21466,until the balance is restored such a moment is rapidly approaching these segments must be traced and returned to me before it is too late before the universe is plunged into eternal chaos
21467,eternal as you understand the term
21468,i have chosen you
21469,precisely
21470,nothing
21471,nothing at all ever
21472,theyre all disguised
21473,they contain the elemental force of the universe they can be in any shape form or size
21474,you will be given a locator
21475,and an assistant
21476,k9 is a mere machine
21477,you will find your assistant waiting for you in the tardis
21478,one final thing doctor
21479,i am the white guardian in order to maintain the universal balance there is also a black guardian and he also requires the key to time but for a different purpose an evil purpose he must not get it doctor at all costs you must prevent that
21480,beware the black guardian
21481,beware beware       romana
21482,i was told to give you this
21483,according to my instructions its the core to the key of time
21484,very exciting isnt it
21485,i may be inexperienced but i did graduate from the academy with a triple first
21486,well its better than scraping through with fifty one percent at the second attempt
21487,oh do you want to know how that works
21488,you have to plug it into your tardis controls just there
21489,i put it there
21490,when plugged into the control console the core indicates the spacetime coordinates of each segment of the key
21491,ill look up those coordinates shall i
21492,well dont you want to know what planet it is
21493,oh
21494,yes of course
21495,well it locates the segment at close range once weve landed on the appropriate planet
21496,and then when its brought into contact with a disguised segment it converts it back into its proper form what would you like me to do
21497,tea
21498,thats hardly a gimmick doctor
21499,what
21500,youre sulking
21501,thats ridiculous for somebody as old as you are
21502,seven hundred and fifty nine
21503,youve lost count somewhere
21504,yes but after the first few centuries i expect things get a little bit foggy dont they
21505,doctor youre not giving me a chance its funny you know but before i met you i was even willing to be impressed
21506,oh yes of course now i realise that your behaviour simply derives from a subtransitory experiential hypertoid induced condition aggravated i expect by multiencephalogical tensions
21507,well to put it very simply doctor youre suffering from a massive compensation syndrome
21508,do you know i might even use your case in my thesis when im back on gallifrey
21509,forty nine four zero vectors unchanged
21510,one hundred and sixteen parsecs
21511,oh take a chance
21512,well what shall we do
21513,this way highness if youd be so kind
21514,its bitter
21515,what
21516,oh yes through there its a strong signal
21517,you couldnt make it clearer
21518,what about my name
21519,romanadvoratnelundar
21520,i dont like romana
21521,all right call me fred
21522,oh  doctor
21523,ah i think this is to stop animals wandering into the city at night theres a cocking lever there just below the keystone
21524,four oclock and alls well caused
21525,what is
21526,four of the clock and alls well obviously just a ritual greeting and reassurance
21527,ah but theres no space service to ribos doctor according to bartholomews planetary gazetteer it has a protected class three society so there cant be any earth aliens on ribos
21528,whats that supposed to mean
21529,its something through there
21530,no of course not
21531,why
21532,very impressive
21533,magnificent jewellry
21534,its something in here
21535,why is it taking so long
21536,well get on with it then
21537,is the is the beast waiting there already i i i cant see my eyes
21538,right lower away
21539,take it up then it could be the shrivenzale
21540,that thing what is it
21541,i never imagined are there many creatures like that in other worlds
21542,im not scared im just listen
21543,we could explain surely
21544,strange
21545,doctor lets ignore this stranger and just concentrate on getting the first segment out of the strong room were wasting time
21546,the crown
21547,ah ill try and remember that
21548,well
21549,oh so all wed have to do is wait for him to get it

21562,i do wish youd explain whats happening doctor
21563,oh thats very helpful
21564,i will not give way to feelings of psychofugal hostility
21565,we have a negative empathy doctor
21566,ive been noticing him quite a lot lately
21567,ah they must have used a rope ladder
21568,why
21569,thats no business of ours doctor weve got more important things to do
21570,how did they get past that

21593,hes a coldblooded maniac he likes killing people
21594,mine
21595,were searching for the first segment to the key to time
21596,whats that doctor
21597,tell the guards we may have to fight our way out of the city
21598,oh a long time ago i was just an ambitious boy in those days taking my first steps in life then i had a bit of trouble with a dissatisfied client and thought it best to leave
21599,he was an arab i sold him sydney harbour for fifty million dollars yeah then he thought i should throw in this opera house as well
21600,oh yes
21601,yeah the opera house but i refused i mean one must have some scruples mustnt one
21602,well i couldnt let that noble edifice to our cultural heritage fall in the wrong hands could i
21603,no but my refusal upset him he took the impressive documents that i had prepared to the government and so my little ruse was prematurely rumbled he came after me with a machine gun it was the most harrowing experience i never went back
21604,doctor there are men out there planning to kill us and youre just sitting here chattering
21605,jethrik whats so special about jethrik
21606,she doesnt know about it
21607,its only the rarest and most powerful element in the universe without jethrik drive thered be no space warping and id still be safely at home on earth
21608,stroke of good luck i acquired that some years ago
21609,oh no thats a very blunt word isnt it
21610,i dont sell mines doctor
21611,oh i dont think its worth all that much
21612,hes crazy you dont know about the graff
21613,he was emperor of levithia once and a bad one a tyrant raised an expedition force to go off to the frontier wars leaving his halfbrother on the throne and when the wars was ended his people refused to let him return
21614,says hes looking for a new world
21615,oh that was unstoffes fault my dear hes a terrible ham at heart
21616,right sir
21617,including us
21618,weve got until dawn doctor how longs that
21619,arent you frightened
21620,if only my wrist speaker was working i could warn him i mean as long as hes free weve got something to bargain with
21621,a little hearing aid i planted earlier its on the same wavelength as unstoffes twoway unfortunately its got no call button
21622,i thought i should tell you because one day even here in the future men will turn to each other and say binro was right
21623,without a receiver we wont even know if its worked anyway
21624,er its er somebody trying to make me happy
21625,k9  k9
21626,whats that
21627,is he dead  k9
21628,straight ahead down the stairs then turn right
21629,well
21630,doctor if theyre all out searching for unstoffe why dont we go down to the relic room and get the segment itll be unguarded
21631,not there but surely its taken the shape of the crown
21632,oh thats the opposite direction from the relic room
21633,oh you mean it was disguised as the jethrik all along
21634,how did you know
21635,no idea
21636,so
21637,ah ha
21638,but the second time it stayed put in the cabinet and it could only have been there a day when we arrived so it could only have been the lump of jethrik which didnt belong there
21639,of course
21640,brilliant
21641,all clear that way
21642,howd you know
21643,unstoffes got the jethrik
21644,they are an ancient labyrinth beneath the city the home of the long dead and of the ice gods
21645,well lets see shall we
21646,huh
21647,straight ahead
21648,have they gone
21649,you nearly got us killed
21650,dont bicker
21651,no we should be looking for my invaluable young friend unstoffe
21652,what is property at such a time
21653,what do we do now
21654,which way
21655,back to the city
21656,what
21657,what now
21658,now
21659,no not you soldier i have a more honourable purpose for you so youre the last of my guards eh the last of my levithian invincibles all the rest are dead now even sholakh were you with me on skarrn soldier
21660,all but one of us sholakh sholakh sholakh to me to me charge onwards onwards push their attack back onwards onwards
21661,doctor
21662,doctor i still dont understand
21663,how did you manage to switch the jethrik for the thermite pack without the graff noticing
21664,oh
21665,quite clever really
21666,indeed it was doctor
21667,oh doctor
21668,a favour to beg do you think i might just handle the jethrik once more please for old times sake you know
21669,oh dear me well there you are doctor
21670,oh goodbye doctor
21671,unstoffe
21672,he switched it back again oh unstoffe is there nobody you can trust these days
21673,well perhaps youd better do it doctor
21674,right
21675,we must prepare
21676,good morning doctor
21677,oh just familiarising myself with the technical details of this capsule
21678,the type forty capsule wasnt on the main syllabus you see
21679,veteran and vintage vehicles was an optional extra i preferred something more interesting
21680,oh the lifecycle of the gallifreyan flutterwing
21681,i wouldnt dream of it
21682,what
21683,oh our next destination
21684,calufrax
21685,right er doctor
21686,what about the synchronic feedback checking circuit
21687,arent you going to set it
21688,oh according to the manual its essential
21689,five hundred and twenty three years
21690,hasnt it and the multiloop stabiliser
21691,multiloop stabiliser it says here on any capsule it will be found impossible to effect a smooth materialisation without first activating the multiloop stabiliser
21692,whats happening
21693,something wrong
21694,no and why not because for ten seconds the whole infrastructure of quantum physics was in retreat find out what happened mister fibuli and find out fast or by all the fires of night ill have that skull off you
21695,oh
21696,oh thats what it was
21697,no of course not may i try
21698,yes
21699,thank you doctor
21700,right synchronic feedback
21701,well see multiloop stabiliser
21702,well
21703,thank you doctor
21704,shall we have a look at calufrax now
21705,it looks very pleasant to me
21706,well
21707,have you decided where we are doctor
21708,yes i know
21709,what
21710,then where are we
21711,uninhabited icecoated planet
21712,well weve certainly come to the right place the signals coming from everywhere
21713,what
21714,i know what it means excuse me
21715,yes  k9
21716,its a new golden age you see a golden age of prosperity i must say i still get very excited about it all i know we have them rather often now but thats because of the captains great goodness you see
21717,oh thank you very much
21718,would you like some jelly babies

21729,it came from over there
21730,we cant hide him forever
21731,idiot brainless fool all guards the mentiads are heading towards sector six find the telepath find him and destroy him
21732,he does this every time the captain announces a new golden age of prosperity
21733,well the last two or three times yes
21734,huh he makes us his fools
21735,the mentiads

21754,tails
21755,how can you take such a dangerous decision like that just leaving it to chance
21756,thats not fair
21757,im not going there im going after pralix
21758,oh its no use once shes made up her mind ill have to go after her myself
21759,but mula needs me
21760,i had an aircar rather like this once it was a present for my seventieth birthday did you know that if you realign the magnetic vectors and fit a polarity oscillator you get twice the speed for half the energy
21761,we dont
21762,in their aircars of course
21763,yes
21764,theres one over there
21765,borrow it thats the captains
21766,no
21767,the macromat field integrator has burnt out sir its one of the four components we cant replace ourselves sir well we are faced with two alternatives captain three alternatives we can try to find a new macromat field integrator though i cant envisage how we would do that alternatively there is a very rare mineral pjx one eight which would conceivably do the same job as the integrator if we could find any either way sir in our current condition we could only possibly make one more jump and that would be risky in the extreme
21768,free to think its amazing the city looks so pretty from up here yes even the mines do you know thats our entire life
21769,well we extract all the raw material that we need from them
21770,no
21771,no
21772,no theyre automated you see we just run the equipment
21773,the captain announces a new golden age of prosperity they just fill up again
21774,yeah well you dont think thats wrong do you
21775,oh oh then of course the lights change
21776,you know the lights the ones on the sky at night little points of light
21777,look down there i think theres some sort of entrance into the mountain
21778,say youre very good at this do you drive these things for a living
21779,i think that sounds terribly interesting dont you
21780,its locked well never get it open its impossible
21781,what you mean you can open it
21782,how
21783,but its still locked
21784,doctor thats amazing
21785,doctor this goes on for ever
21786,doctor whats happening
21787,yes
21788,right
21789,ah no doctor id rather come with you
21790,we must find the doctor
21791,hello
21792,seize him
21793,doctor beware your manner appeals only to the homicidal side of my nature
21794,doctor i think this is the root of the trouble
21795,yes and the amblicyclic photon bridge
21796,locus
21797,oh mister fibuli
21798,amazing i suppose youre going to tell me youve seen it all before
21799,really
21800,what do you mean you suspected
21801,what do you mean you suspected
21802,gravitic anomalising input reading nine point five check
21803,you mean you knew they were here you knew that this mountains really a spaceship and its broken down
21804,but how how did you know
21805,and what does that mean
21806,that is what we must find out we must let them lead us into their vessel the guards have tried to gain entry to it but have failed so we must allow them a little rope
21807,hmm
21808,what from the captain
21809,oh hes just a terrible old bully all that by the evil nose of the sky demon nonsense is just bluster
21810,the reason why weve come here is to find the second segment of the key in case youd forgotten getting involved in all this
21811,i just dont understand it it seems to give out a continuous signal wherever we go
21812,what
21813,you know what will happen if i even begin to suspect you of sabotage
21814,or your life
21815,the girl stays here
21816,guards escort them to their ship any attempt to escape is to be met with instant obliteration
21817,doctor
21818,doctor
21819,where are we going
21820,the penalty is death
21821,where are we doctor
21822,three miles
21823,but its so cold
21824,hollow
21825,its frozen ground doctor i dont understand cold wet
21826,they dont
21827,those engines
21828,you mean other planets
21829,then what were standing on now
21830,buried inside zanak
21831,do you mean that whole other worlds have died to make us rich whole other worlds like ours
21832,some of them inhabited
21833,doctor
21834,the tracer its gone mad the second segment must be down here somewhere
21835,theyre on our side
21836,but i dont understand
21837,you mean they slammed him to the wall with good vibrations  k9
21838,doctor did you bring us the understanding we seek for generation upon generation our planet has been assailed by a nameless evil we would know its name
21839,with each new mentiad we grow stronger but still the understanding evades us were constricted by the peoples hatred
21840,can you help us doctor we are powerless unless we understand can you tell us whats happening to zanak
21841,hollow
21842,vanish is that possible
21843,in this case a planet called calufrax
21844,zanak just helping you along doctor
21845,zanak
21846,just like an enormous leech
21847,the omens
21848,she had some kind of evil powers the legend says she lived for hundreds of years
21849,shush doctor
21850,please carry on  k9
21851,just a few miserable nomadic tribes
21852,the legend speaks of a giant silver ship that fell from the sky one night with a mighty crash like thunder the captain was one of the few survivors
21853,i dont think anyone knows  k9
21854,for some of us terrible agonies of the mind began
21855,why doctor do you know
21856,what is the life force
21857,every atom of matter in the universe has a certain amount of energy locked inside it now with something the size of a planet theres an enormous quantity
21858,so every time zanak crushes a planet it releases all that energy now some of it will be on psychic wavelengths
21859,so every time it happens theres a fantastic blast of psychic energy enough to smash open the neural pathways of anyone with telepathic abilities like you mentiads
21860,and each planet as it dies adds to that power the power by which it will be avenged  k9
21861,i assure you my old skills are very much alive
21862,hold it
21863,it will ha it will indeed      k9
21864,so doctor you have discovered the little secret of our planet
21865,and what makes you so certain of that
21866,ah but none i dare guess more vicious
21867,silence
21868,oh cant i
21869,by the hounds of hell
21870,but captain
21871,my trophies doctor feast your eyes on them for they represent an achievement unparalleled in the universe
21872,not memorials these are the entire remains of the worlds themselves
21873,i come in here to dream of freedom
21874,yes doctor each of these small spheres is the crushed remains of a planet million upon millions of tons of compressed rock held suspended here by forces beyond the limits of the imagination forces that i have generated and harnessed
21875,precisely
21876,why doesnt it because the whole system is so perfectly aligned by the most exquisite exercise in gravitational geometry that every system is balanced out within itself which is why we can stand next to billions of tons of super compressed matter and not even be aware of it with each new planet i acquire the forces are realigned but the system remains stable
21877,im gratified that you appreciate it
21878,devil storms doctor it is not a toy
21879,the doctor knows what hes doing
21880,were preparing to meet your friends the mentiads the poor misbegotten fools who are going to attempt to storm the bridge
21881,what
21882,what
21883,doctor where where are we
21884,the bridge whats that
21885,whats that machine hes
21886,a what
21887,wag your tongue well doctor it is the only weapon you have left
21888,yes
21889,voolium
21890,one five
21891,calufrax
21892,excellent mister fibuli excellent you see doctor your friends are doomed
21893,you hideous murdering maniac
21894,avitron kill
21895,whats this place
21896,locked
21897,were trapped
21898,what you mean they stop time
21899,thats repulsive what is it
21900,what no no xanxias dead
21901,you mean she can hear me but i just called
21902,does she know were here
21903,prepare to prise open the door
21904,so whole other worlds have been destroyed with the sole purpose of keeping that alive
21905,even more
21906,not in that revolting condition no
21907,well its certainly a relief but how are we going to get out of here
21908,so
21909,what about you
21910,yes sir
21911,so doctor you have survived
21912,and your colleagues
21913,excellent and my polyphase avitron
21914,yes sir
21915,guilty
21916,guilty
21917,a plank the theory is very simple you walk along it at the end you fall off drop one thousand feet dead
21918,i shall listen to you when i hear you scream
21919,bye bye
21920,doctor
21921,then who    doctor 2
21922,good now well show these zombies who rules here
21923,bring the manifest
21924,that thing is not me this is now the real queen xanxia
21925,permanent regeneration based on cells in my old body and thus containing all the memory patterns and all the brilliance built up over the centuries
21926,im nearly complete my molecular structure has almost bound together finally and forever that is why you could not turn me off
21927,i have calculated every detail i shall live for ever
21928,you dare to mock me
21929,you shall die now for your insolence
21930,what do you know of eternal life
21931,when this body becomes fully corporeal
21932,my calculations
21933,no impossible
21934,i gutted my own planet zanak for all the energy it contained ive ransacked planets from bandraginus to calufrax do you think im going to stop now
21935,youre lying trying to save your worthless neck
21936,and you have located a planet where we can find the mineral pjx one eight
21937,yes
21938,captain we will mine that planet immediately prepare to make the jump
21939,ten minutes captain
21940,no doctor not whilst we have the psychic interference transmitter
21941,yes yes you see whilst that is fully operational the mentiads are powerless oh the doors
21942,they were with you
21943,doctor were fighting a losing battle the mentiads cant get their psychokinetic powers to work
21944,its no use doctor the engine room is barricaded with steel inches thick
21945,i thought he was following on his batteries are exhausted from trying to burn down the door
21946,what are we going to do doctor
21947,what did he say
21948,right
21949,its clearing the buzzing its clearing
21950,brothers
21951,doctor do you remember what happened when we first tried to materialise on calufrax
21952,we couldnt because zanak was trying to materialise in the same place
21953,yes
21954,a strip of metal
21955,subdivided at one end with an acute angle halfway along
21956,what were you thinking of doctor
21957,why should anyone want to bend a fork
21958,doctor behind us guards
21959,come on doctor
21960,yes
21961,no
21962,destroy everything
21963,what did you do
21964,and
21965,ah and so he discovered gravity
21966,theres the tardis doctor
21967,good good id better get back
21968,five eight zero four four six eight four eight eight four
21969,doctor if were going to try and materialise at exactly the same point in time and space how do we know when to do it it only happened as a fluke the first time
21970,right
21971,its getting worse theres no way we can survive this
21972,what are you doing
21973,doctor
21974,what but thats madness its the only protection weve got
21975,its been nice knowing you doctor
21976,more power captain more power
21977,doctor the tardis is about to explode its going to explode    a large spanner rises off the floor  doctor
21978,weve done it doctor
21979,yeah
21980,is that her
21981,its a pity we cant just switch her off
21982,well what do we do then
21983,somehow somehow mister fibuli my friend you shall be avenged
21984,incredible a masterpiece of gravitic geometry
21985,so all that shouting and blustering was just an act to lull xanxia into a false sense of security while he built this
21986,brothers our strength is increasing it may be possible come
21987,but hell have the controls on the bridge
21988,wait a minute the only way the captain could destroy xanxia without blowing himself and this whole mountain to atoms would be to get inside the perimeter of the time dams without disturbing it right
21989,which would require astronomic energy sources
21990,so when he has enough of them all he has to do is alter the balance slightly and create a standing vortex in the middle of the time field so time starts up at the normal speed and the queen dies
21991,brilliant but i dont see how it helps us
21992,why not the theorys sound enough
21993,calufrax
21994,so that means calufrax the entire planet
21995,of course no wonder the tracer kept going mad
21996,what
21997,i thought you had it
21998,but we cant move that we cant move anything here if we do well just upset the whole system and create a gravity whirlpool
21999,what are you doing
22000,die you fool die and now doctor its your turn
22001,no doctor never again
22002,are they dead
22003,what about you
22004,what about you
22005,all right
22006,what did you do on the bridge doctor
22007,try me
22008,so we can operate them from here
22009,but i dont see how that helps
22010,into the hollow centre of zanak
22011,what then
22012,but what about calufrax how do we get hold of calufrax
22013,well naturally oh thats quite ingenious
22014,all right its fantastic
22015,congratulations
22016,fantastic
22017,but doctor havent you forgotten something
22018,what about the bridge and the time dams
22019,oh isnt that rather crude
22020,doctor when all this is over will we really be free
22021,ill do it
22022,ready doctor
22023,we will
22024,here let me do it
22025,i used to be rather good at puzzles
22026,well hardly complex enough to be called a puzzle is it
22027,look shouldnt we be getting on weve only got two segments why dont you go and find out where our next destination is
22028,oh
22029,come o great one come your time is near    romana
22030,well how do i look
22031,thats not what i meant i mean will this do
22032,oh i rather like them
22033,what doctor what does it mean
22034,doctor i do wish i knew what you were talking about
22035,what look i only want to know about our mission
22036,after all what would i do if something happened to you
22037,well
22038,what
22039,but i saw he told me well what am i doing here
22040,just like the segment of the key
22041,yes i know that but what i dont know is why
22042,and i suppose the key can prevent that
22043,everything
22044,i see and i suppose theres a time like that approaching
22045,whats that
22046,earth
22047,i might have guessed your favourite planet
22048,oh everybody knows that
22049,i cant think why for the life of me
22050,hmm oxygen level good slight aqueous precipitation
22051,so it would appear
22052,oh really
22053,tennis
22054,never mind forget it  k9
22055,so this is earth is it
22056,hmm well the third segments cant be far away its over there
22057,what is
22058,why strange theyre indentations obviously caused by something very heavy
22059,oh probably some form of animal
22060,oh more i should think
22061,yes judging by the specific density of the ground here
22062,over there
22063,what is it
22064,i can see that but whats it for
22065,observatory theyre just stones arent they
22066,oh i didnt realise the people here were so primitive
22067,ah i see its very old is it
22068,fascinating do you think one of these stones is the third segment
22069,its been surveyed you know
22070,surveyed the circle many times
22071,ah so you noticed it did you
22072,i always knew it was a matter of time before another professional came in and noticed the discrepancies oh havent i met you somewhere before professor
22073,oh doctor yes of course i have a wonderful memory for faces fougous
22074,fougous cornish fougous you read that paper on them at the symposium at princeton or was it cardiff oh or was it that fool leamingtonsmith oh dreadful paper complete bosh
22075,professor emilia rumford author of bronze age burials in gloucestershire
22076,what was obvious
22077,curious isnt it
22078,what
22079,oh vivien doctor my friend miss vivien fay
22080,really
22081,i thought you told me earth was civilised now
22082,oh i think you dismiss them a little too easily
22083,well their leader mister de vries is a very unpleasant man
22084,yes as a matter of fact we thought you were one of his group
22085,no no more than we can help all that mumbojumbo nonsense no vivien and i are conducting a topographical geological astronomical archeological survey of the site
22086,oh he lives over the hill in the big house
22087,what now
22088,i warn you doctor he doesnt like scientists
22089,oh its probably one of the local farmers moving equipment
22090,yes you cant miss it
22091,only
22092,yes well i didnt realise
22093,thank you
22094,right
22095,right
22096,our friends impatient dont lets keep him waiting
22097,he surveyed the nine travellers but then you probably know that already doctor
22098,correct
22099,it was very sad about doctor borlase
22100,didnt professor rumford tell you
22101,one of the stones fell on him just after he completed his survey
22102,shes quite safe
22103,those are away being cleaned one of thems rather fine by the scottish painter ramsey lady morgana montcalm perhaps youve heard of her
22104,the montcalms owned this land and this house including the circle they used to call her the wicked lady montcalm
22105,thats mrs trefusis she was a recluse she lived here for sixty years and never saw a soul
22106,and thats a brazilian lady or would be if she were here senora camara
22107,he doesnt seem to have survived the crossing from brazil but dont lets stand about here in the hall doctor do come in let me offer you a glass of sherry
22108,good see you later then
22109,its not exactly what youd call a pet doctor
22110,didnt i doctor
22111,you never told me what your interest in the circle is
22112,what
22113,a key to what
22114,not in the conventional sense no but i am a humble student of druidic lore
22115,boring what do you mean
22116,it is no laughing matter
22117,the stones are sacred
22118,to one who is mighty and allpowerful to the goddess
22119,she has many names morrigu nermintana the cailleach
22120,goddess of war death and magic beware the raven or the crow doctor they are her eyes
22121,the cailleach will have foreseen everything we must have faith she will come
22122,blasphemer
22123,im not going to be a party to this
22124,then dont be
22125,bicycle
22126,youll die with blasphemy on your lips
22127,hang on im coming
22128,good grief man what are you doing youll catch your death of cold
22129,who were those people they looked as if they were going to cut your throat
22130,i came back to give romana a flask of tea knowing how irresponsible men are i thought shed still be waiting for you
22131,no she stayed behind to wait for you
22132,it can be very dangerous in the dark
22133,oh her shoes
22134,well the only thing we can do is to organise a search party in the morning of course if we had a dog
22135,you have a dog
22136,oh thats one of those high frequency whistles isnt it
22137,yes of course doctor
22138,its getting rather exciting isnt it
22139,keep away
22140,k9 watch him
22141,oh no im not giving you a second chance
22142,you pushed me over the edge
22143,get away from me
22144,who are you
22145,well if you didnt push me over this cliff then who did and believe me it was no projection you were solid well it was solid
22146,the image of you doctor the third segment
22147,the power to transform objects or at least their appearance
22148,somebodys got it and theyve found a way of utilising its powers
22149,well so what do we do
22150,yes thanks
22151,of course
22152,what do you think i was doing before you pushed me over the all right there was no trace i promise you
22153,well it cant be there
22154,well pretty rusty but i still dont see how that explains
22155,yes definitely positive
22156,oh thank heavens youre safe doctor shes safe good whats that
22157,but isnt that rather
22158,oh really
22159,do you have to have a licence
22160,whats that
22161,what is
22162,i still dont understand
22163,oh naturally
22164,nobodys ever had to question the quality of my research
22165,oh back at miss fays cottage
22166,oh id be delighted
22167,where are you going doctor
22168,what after what he did to you
22169,go
22170,oh poor little fellow is he badly hurt
22171,is he all right
22172,yes but is it repairable  k9
22173,what can we do
22174,oh no if we remove the cerebral core hes finished
22175,a molecular stabiliser
22176,is the tardis fitted with a molecular stabiliser
22177,i thought so we had a lecture once at the academy if i link up the molecular stabiliser to the circuit frequency modulator
22178,you really think so
22179,anythings worth a try look at him hes on his last legs
22180,bodies what bodies
22181,creature
22182,globulin whats globulin
22183,ogri ogri you shall do my bidding do you hear ogri do you hear
22184,nothing prior to 1700 you
22185,what has
22186,oh the witch hag
22187,its only a legend
22188,i dont see why the paintings are so important
22189,where what
22190,oh jumping joshua a priest hole
22191,wait for me doctor  doctor
22192,good grief i dont believe it
22193,i know that face
22194,she never told me she was related to the montcalm family
22195,but look at the dates theres a hundred and fifty years
22196,you mean
22197,i never thought wed get out of there alive
22198,doctor did i understand you correctly that thing is made of stone
22199,but its impossible
22200,i meant a silicon based lifeform is unknown unheard of impossible
22201,doctor
22202,in the cause of science i think it our duty to capture that creature
22203,we could track it to its lair
22204,i know youre under considerable strain doctor but please keep a grip on yourself
22205,is it dead do you suppose
22206,ive been so many things emilia for so many years
22207,oh not really doctor you see ive got romana
22208,where youll never be able to find her oh shes perfectly safe no need to worry so long as you leave me in peace
22209,i wouldnt come too close if i were you doctor
22210,its still very effective dont worry about romana doctor i should worry about yourself if i were you
22211,extraordinary what did she mean about the stones
22212,missing whats happened to them
22213,oh you mean that thing was one of the stones
22214,ogri
22215,what do you mean
22216,huh you said there were three of these things
22217,here
22218,crystals
22219,oh but doctor what about vivien what about romana
22220,yes but where have they disappeared to how are we going to find them
22221,these are the only crystals i could find apart from a packet of epsom salts
22222,i still dont understand where romana and vivien are
22223,hyperspace  k9
22224,i still dont understand about hyperspace
22225,oh i never studied that
22226,oh i beg your pardon
22227,said that you cannot travel in space faster than the speed of light because the speed of light is a limiting factor if you travelled more than a hundred and eighty thousand miles per second youd encounter the time distortion effect
22228,in fact youd arrive at your destination before youd left your starting point
22229,oh i dont know
22230,oh theyre all the same these physicists oh sorry
22231,is there really
22232,otherwise hyperspace
22233,but i still dont know where romana and vivien are
22234,oh i see
22235,doctor
22236,may i ask you a personal question
22237,are you from outer space
22238,oh
22239,ah
22240,i think so switch on and then wait until the needle points on the dial to oh oh three seven then throw that lever
22241,pow
22242,yes but what happens if the ogri come back while youre wherever youll be
22243,for how long  k9
22244,yeah but what about you
22245,yes but how will you get back
22246,if you think thatll work
22247,no
22248,er oh oh two two oh oh three three oh oh three seven

22252,oh oh three seven holding  k9
22253,k9
22254,very funny where have you been whats happening where am i
22255,what do you mean hyperspace it cant be
22256,well hyperspace is a theoretical absurdity everybody knows that
22257,thats ridiculous
22258,even granting the hyperspace hypothesis doctor what about deceleration how do you decelerate an infinite mass anyway where is this ship why cant it be seen from earth
22259,thats only few feet from the circle why cant it be seen
22260,in hyperspace not in ordinary four dimensional space
22261,well why has it stopped here
22262,are you sure this things been here for four thousand years
22263,well look at the cabin and the controls theyre like new
22264,vivien fay
22265,well maybe it ran aground
22266,who knows whats in hyperspace
22267,do you think there could be anything alive in any of these
22268,what
22269,look the seal on that doors a different colour from the rest
22270,what does it say
22271,anything there
22272,well what shall we do
22273,whats that
22274,it is not permitted to touch the megara
22275,without fear or favour  megara 2
22276,whats the matter
22277,stop turn around do not move  megara 2
22278,where is your authorisation
22279,no they cant get back if you    vivien
22280,what
22281,ogri stop the megara
22282,did you break the seals
22283,silence he is ours he is ours afterwards you may have him
22284,oh may i watch you dont mind do you doctor
22285,i defended you  megara 2
22286,you are a humanoid and therefore quite incapable of appreciating the subtleties of the law
22287,as your counsel my advice to you is to submit to execution so much easier in the end
22288,article twenty three of the legal code subsection seventeen
22289,i demand that you execute him now  megara 2
22290,you must tell the megara were time lords
22291,tell them
22292,what happened
22293,me
22294,as far as i look i object to the wording  megara 2
22295,that would be most regrettable miss romanadvoratrelundar
22296,dead things
22297,well bodies of dead creatures dead travellers i suppose
22298,no
22299,i didnt know it could have been anything
22300,yes
22301,oh its not so difficult after all  k9
22302,but im not a witness
22303,but im not a witness i didnt see anything i dont know anything
22304,no  megara 2
22305,what are you up to doctor
22306,is that important
22307,what do you mean
22308,you mean theyre after miss fay
22309,why dont they just arrest her
22310,ah i suppose those poor creatures back there were the police
22311,well if this is a police vessel then surely they must have a description of her an identification voice print
22312,there must be something incriminating in her cottage ill try and get back somehow
22313,can you keep it going here
22314,doctor we are waiting
22315,wheres that girl going she has no right leaving the court without the judges permission
22316,unnecessary
22317,because she was present when the seals to our compartment was broken this witness was not
22318,run professor run
22319,we are programmed against the possibility of error
22320,correct
22321,because we did not see her when we emerged
22322,do you now say she was there
22323,a reading of zero point six on the scale is registered
22324,we do not make mistakes
22325,incapable of error
22326,irrational  megara 2
22327,i am you are my client
22328,proceed with the execution immediately
22329,but there are no other witnesses here
22330,who
22331,we cannot be called to give evidence
22332,because we are justice machines travelling on judicial business
22333,diplos a g class planet in tau ceti
22334,to try a humanoid criminal
22335,come on lets get out of here
22336,murder and the removal and misuse of the great seal of diplos
22337,it has the powers of transmutation transformation and the establishing of hyperspatial and temporal coordinates
22338,she is known as cessair of diplos
22339,we have none
22340,we do not
22341,an officer was to identify her when we reached our destination
22342,yes
22343,all this is irrelevant your honours the accused is merely trying to delay his long overdue execution  megara 2
22344,prove it
22345,k9
22346,we are allowed to execute only prisoners who have been found guilty
22347,too late doctor goodbye
22348,quickly beam me through
22349,why did you try to involve miss fay in your execution
22350,we have no legal authority to kill her
22351,why should we do that
22352,we will check  megara 2
22353,stop i have new evidence
22354,what
22355,vivien what are those things
22356,if you let them do this to me doctor youll never find what youre looking for
22357,not quite doctor
22358,there is still the matter of your delayed execution
22359,where are they going
22360,the nine travellers theyll have to be surveyed all over again oh thatll put the cat amongst the pigeons believe me
22361,i do have my academic reputation to consider

22369,eleven oh yes sorry k9  k9
22370,was that smooth enough for you doctor
22371,i said was that smooth enough
22372,tara
22373,earthtype gravity oxygen atmosphere climate temperate
22374,me

22395,you know about such things
22396,you know about machines electronics
22397,you dont look like a peasant
22398,but you have certain skills can you mend an android
22399,an android
22400,it wont go
22401,shall i kill him now swordmaster
22402,im terribly sorry
22403,doctor you must forgive swordsman farrah he tends to get overenthusiastic in the pursuit of his duties
22404,but particularly in defence of his prince
22405,peasant you will speak with respect when you address prince reynart of tara
22406,but you do know about androids
22407,so youre not a peasant
22408,very well ill make you an offer one thousand gold pieces if you can mend our android
22409,done
22410,no we wont zadek this man is obviously a gentleman if he can mend our android we shall reward him if he cannot you have my word doctor you will come to no harm you may go free
22411,wait the android
22412,perhaps youre right zadek well doctor can it be fixed
22413,for one thing it must wear this
22414,tomorrow at the appropriate hour fixed by the astrologers in the great coronation room of the palace of tara i am to be crowned king
22415,they will be in order if i get there
22416,count grendel of gracht
22417,hell kill me if he needs to after all you cant crown a dead prince grendel and his men will be watching every entrance to the palace to prevent my getting to the coronation room at the ordained time
22418,if i fail to appear at the right moment i forfeit my right to the crown
22419,the only other contender for the throne is the princess strella but she disappeared some time ago nobody knows where she is
22420,there have been three attempts on his highnesss life already the next one could be successful
22421,precisely we use george the android copy of me to create a diversion to distract their attention
22422,to draw their fire while we slip past the guards into the coronation room what do you think doctor
22423,excellent farrah bring wine do you know its quite eerie seeing oneself walk and talk like that i never thought id see that thing going again
22424,oh zadek always the pessimist thank you doctor
22425,you wouldnt be interested in permanent employment would you doctor
22426,pity still you will stay and drink a toast to our success for tomorrow wont you
22427,thank you your highness
22428,with your permission your highness to the king
22429,not yet tomorrow perhaps thanks to the doctor
22430,your highness
22431,wake up you traitor
22432,traitor
22433,i want you to be totally conscious when i kill you
22434,theres only one thing preventing me from running you through right now
22435,where is he
22436,thats enough farrah doctor the prince has gone
22437,vanished hes been kidnapped
22438,your master count grendel of course
22439,why should he remain when the prince has been taken it doesnt make sense
22440,they took the real prince what use is the copy
22441,what honour demands
22442,farrah and i will take our swords and do battle with the counts men
22443,a swordsman does not fear death if he dies with honour
22444,correct
22445,crown an android king of tara never
22446,in any case grendels men will see that we dont get into the coronation room
22447,he had a plan
22448,there is a secret passage
22449,i hope not
22450,doctor i see only two objections to your plan
22451,what if the android breaks down
22452,second problem security
22453,precisely farrah i can trust
22454,no doctor youll be with the android at all times
22455,what are you doing
22456,i dont see any dog
22457,doctor youve checked the android
22458,everything is functioning correctly
22459,i have great confidence in you doctor
22460,but remember either farrah or myself will be with you at all times dont let us down
22461,what is that thing
22462,but its a machine
22463,youve lost someone
22464,what
22465,where was she last seen
22466,which way was she going
22467,and now my friend i must go to your coronation its a pity you will miss it
22468,about eight leagues from here
22469,youre not thinking of going there alone
22470,to tara itself he will want to make sure that no one else claims the throne
22471,youre going to help us then
22472,correct doctor
22473,doctor
22474,is he a good hunting dog
22475,were almost there wait here ill go ahead and scout
22476,be careful swordmaster hes not as young as he used to be
22477,are you all right sir how do you feel  i cant talk to androids is he all right
22478,hes not talking
22479,hell have to make a speech at his coronation
22480,i dont know what it is about androids i know its silly you know what i mean
22481,ill deal with him
22482,in a few hours
22483,they were plague tunnels built about two hundred years ago to allow the royal court to move in and out of the palace without having to pass through the contaminated city
22484,thats when the survivors started using androids to replace the people
22485,doctor
22486,is he going to be all right
22487,weve been followed doctor take the prince well try to hold them off here theres a lever at the top pull it down it opens a panel hurry
22488,my subjects i acknowledge your salutations and i swear that i will uphold your rights and devote myself to defending and proootecting you at all times
22489,let the first lady of the land of tara come forward and make her vows
22490,i princess strella descendant of the royal kings of tara mistress of the domains of thorvald mortgarde and freya do humbly offer my loyalty to the king and do hereby recognise his suzerainty over me and all whom i command
22491,how did you know
22492,but it doesnt make sense why send an android to swear loyalty to the king
22493,but who would want to kill the king
22494,you presume too much zadek well what does his majesty have to say on the matter he is very quiet
22495,who the devil are you sir
22496,is his majesty ill
22497,but what of the danger
22498,will he be all right tomorrow
22499,i think you do lamia prepare another android an exact copy precise to the last detail i have an idea our guest can help us      k9
22500,so grendel now holds all the cards
22501,he has to attend the convocation with the archimandrite and the priests will he be able to
22502,oh quite so your majesty
22503,oh drat i keep forgetting hes only an android doctor the king seems to be how shall i say a trifle more
22504,we dont want him too intelligent doctor you cant trust androids you know
22505,what
22506,who
22507,swordsman i will speak only to the doctor those are my orders
22508,i have a message from madame lamia
22509,yeah shes count grendels woman a peasant
22510,she would have me tell you that she fears for the counts safety
22511,now theyve crowned the android king the count is politically powerless
22512,good dog good dog
22513,what
22514,you refused of course
22515,its an obvious trap you cant go
22516,where is the meeting to take place
22517,yes its on grendels estate in the woods near the castle
22518,now how does the doctor do this
22519,go charger start start go you stupid creature go
22520,doctor
22521,we agreed to meet at midnight
22522,do i need one

22525,outside
22526,well doctor arent you going to greet your friend  k9
22527,kill him kill him kill him

22529,the princess hold your fire
22530,fools dolts that wasnt the princess it was romana after them
22531,incredible
22532,ah this must be the android king
22533,and these gentlemen
22534,hes not very well we must think of a plan to rescue him
22535,he doesnt sound it power packs need recharging i expect
22536,oh doctor well there you are i was glad you managed to escape safely
22537,only a word with the doctor according to the usages of war
22538,ah excellent
22539,oh doctor youre a remarkable man
22540,yes a man after my own heart
22541,here you are new to taran politics and in no time at all what have you become
22542,kingmaker extraordinary thanks to you keeping that microcircuitry going zadek has his king but have you thought what would happen if something went seriously wrong like an overload on the circuits
22543,your usefulness ceases
22544,you know too much you become a dangerous embarrassment to zadek an embarrassment to be got rid of and dont think he wouldnt
22545,suppose we both unmade our kings no more king reynart at all
22546,a vacancy for a new king
22547,no no no doctor no there would be opposition no i was thinking youd make an excellent king
22548,why did you do that
22549,commander take six men mount up and follow the count
22550,but if we do what youre suggesting we expose our left flank
22551,hard to say the last siege of the castle of gracht went on for nearly two years
22552,whats that
22553,have you ever known grendel abide by the rules of war but whos going to open the gates
22554,one man alone
22555,oh but i do im sure you will because if you refuse the princess will die very slowly now what have you to say good i thought youd see reason i shall return shortly be ready
22556,the old watergate should be right under the far wall
22557,im afraid the door must be a foot thick the timbers were intended to withstand any battering ram
22558,but
22559,doctor
22560,take this you may need it
22561,well be waiting doctor
22562,i am where are the happy couple they are in their quarters i shall inform them we are ready and conduct them here myself
22563,remember no trouble or the princess dies that i promise
22564,after you
22565,and do you strella princess of the royal house of tara take this man reynart king of tara to be your lawful wedded husband
22566,doctor
22567,you seem to make a habit of interfering in my affairs doctor
22568,leave him leave him hes mine defend yourself sir
22569,doctor hes the best swordsman on tara
22570,you improve doctor
22571,well thats a very long story
22572,next time i shall not be so lenient
22573,doctor i owe you my life how can i repay you
22574,such swordsmanship i never thought id live to see the day when anyone would beat count grendel
22575,why not stay here this castle and all its lands can be yours anything you care to name
22576,she followed kurster out
22577,the princess strella
22578,in the dungeons
22579,its really only a question of patience and a certain delicacy of touch im sure you can manage it go on thats right very good
22580,er no im princess strella
22581,right
22582,the segment
22583,doctor it was in here somewhere its disappeared
22584,oh right
22585,very funny
22586,do you know ill be quite sorry to leave tara
22587,doctor talking of forgetting things wheres k9
22588,was it absolutely necessary to land in a quagmire
22589,try telling that to k9 hes marooned
22590,really isnt that a little low for a planet
22591,doctor sometimes i dont think youre quite right in the head
22592,oh its not a very clear reading its a very diffuse signal it seems to cover about forty two and a half degrees in that direction
22593,hmm i dont like the sound of that
22594,it either means the source is right on top of us which it isnt
22595,yes well perhaps the atmosphere heres affecting it i know ill try the higher ground here
22596,i dont intend to
22597,i tell you it is not rohmdutt youve shot the wrong man
22598,who are you then go on tell us what are you doing here
22599,who sent you
22600,the swampies must have got her
22601,if they jump us here we dont stand a chance
22602,youre coming with us
22603,i insist there are a lot of very important questions yet to be answered
22604,we dont know who it is we found him in the prohibited area
22605,hes a gunrunner dont you know him
22606,what were you doing out there
22607,well looking for a friend in a prohibited area a hundred yards from a classified project could lead you into a lot of trouble
22608,youre in the middle of it
22609,so you admit that you know what it is
22610,this is a pilot plant the first ever built
22611,get up are you claiming that youre from outside this constellation
22612,and how did you get here
22613,he is crazy
22614,all right expert whats that
22615,not that that
22616,and that
22617,a plasmin catalyst
22618,yes
22619,no
22620,what were you doing out there
22621,and youll get a spear in your back theyve killed two of my men already  dugeen
22622,thats what makes the operation viable if we used freighters it wouldnt be a commercial proposition
22623,of course the plant is fully automated the computer controls the orbit shot but we like to double check
22624,if theres a misfire then we have a manual override system
22625,no five
22626,oh youre counting mensch hes a swampie
22627,no
22628,when we put ten full scale refineries in here therell be no room for the natives and they know it
22629,it can
22630,we have calculated the methane production we can satisfy the protein requirements of one fifth of delta magna
22631,why do you ask
22632,one minute to shot
22633,we never found the bodies the swampies made quite sure of that
22634,they were experienced men
22635,dont you worry about the swampies well look after them provided they see reason
22636,why not tell me would you let a small band of semisavages stand in the way of progress
22637,kroll kroll kroll kroll kroll
22638,i wondered where you were
22639,its coming from the settlement
22640,my people are calling kroll theyre making a blood sacrifice
22641,oh its their name for a giant squid centuries ago when we resettled the swampies from delta magna we shipped along a couple of specimens just to keep them happy
22642,dont be stupid youll never cross those swamps on your own
22643,itll be light in one hour so well take a swamp glider and go in force
22644,how did you know
22645,too convincing but theres no need to be smug about it
22646,i can tell that expression even from behind
22647,sucker marks
22648,presumably that was kroll
22649,yes they seem to think i should be quite honoured to be sacrificed to the thing
22650,then that explains the masquerade it must have been political
22651,but you will fight with us now rohmdutt we need every gun
22652,fascinating
22653,doctor theres something i have to tell you
22654,i dropped the tracer
22655,oh well lets get out of here and find the fifth segment
22656,yes but about our monster hes liable to be back at any moment with his friends
22657,why
22658,really
22659,how did you manage that
22660,what is this refinery they keep accusing me of coming from it
22661,whos they
22662,ah because they thought this moon was no use to anybody
22663,and now theyve found something here they want theyre trying to get rid of them again
22664,but methane
22665,as much as that
22666,but it doesnt make sense i mean how can they possibly produce that much protein wheres it coming from
22667,yes this lot are spoiling for a war too the whole idea of this sacrifice was to propitiate kroll and get him on their side thats why i said it was political and theres a gunrunner here called rohmdutt he thinks ive been sent here to get evidence against him
22668,what
22669,doctor does it matter lets just get out of here and find the segment and leave them to it itll be dawn soon
22670,i hate underground passages
22671,whats that youve got
22672,oh a sort of holy writ
22673,where they originally came from
22674,whats the footnote
22675,oh i like a book with a happy ending
22676,no just pops up every couple of centuries
22677,you think kroll really exists
22678,well if we had any sense we wouldnt stay
22679,i tell you that is what i saw that thing is alive
22680,what are you talking about
22681,kroll
22682,yes if a thing that size takes a nap every couple of centuries its feeding processes must continue independently probably through its tentacles
22683,like prodding a sleeping tiger
22684,doctor
22685,doctor
22686,weve got company
22687,as what
22688,seize them
22689,rohmdutt a popular figure in these parts about an hour ago
22690,i didnt like the bit about death according to one of the seven holy rituals
22691,it was a plot you bought us rotten weapons so that wed enter into a battle we couldnt win oh no you cheated us rohmdutt just as the dryfoots have always cheated our people
22692,what do you know of it
22693,id rather not die at all
22694,the great one condemns the prisoners to die by the seventh holy ritual of the great book
22695,silence
22696,this one knows what he has done you dryfoot have aroused the wrath of the great one by denying him his promised victim
22697,kroll rose before us at dawn today we were waiting to kill the dryfoots when the great one appeared and drove them away
22698,enough talk take them away
22699,well use a secondary line and pump to half capacity until youve fixed it
22700,im rather more interested in surviving myself
22701,ranquin says that your crimes are too serious kroll will only be appeased by extending your death agonies
22702,will you stop babbling about the architecture were having a serious conversation about death
22703,what window
22704,it was brought from delta magna when the temple was first built
22705,who
22706,look are you trying to take my mind off something because youre almost succeeding
22707,i dont want to hear it
22708,as the creepers dry it shortens them it pulls the plank
22709,youll be able to die happy wont you
22710,im sorry this has to happen but if krolls not appeased he will not help the people of the lakes
22711,before your deaths if you have anything to say to the servant of kroll let it be said
22712,foolish levity leave
22713,were not savages suffering is unpleasant to witness
22714,what do you know of that dryfoot
22715,kroll had the power of the symbol he sees all
22716,the symbol was a holy relic brought here by our ancestors at the time of the settlement
22717,he who holds the symbol can see the future the power revealed how the dryfoots would destroy delta magna with their fighting and their greed and the evil of their great cities that is why my people came to settle here
22718,what do these questions matter to you who are already dying
22719,your mind is bent dryfoot its well that you die
22720,oh thats what you were trying to do
22721,how long have we got
22722,i can feel it dragging already
22723,thawn he wanted an excuse to wipe them out
22724,i told them the guns were sent by the sons of earth oh i got a signed receipt too for thawn to use to discredit them
22725,do you have to keep asking questions at a time like this now
22726,why do they call themselves the sons of earth not that i care very much
22727,mother earth they call it they believe colonising the planets is a mistake they want us all to return to the earth and starve oh oh my ankles are breaking
22728,i cant breathe
22729,oh oh my backs breaking
22730,i think im past the point
22731,oh no
22732,what a pity we cant sit up and watch it
22733,just listen to that rain i pity anybody out in that lot
22734,its not that bad yet
22735,what
22736,the tension its easing already
22737,doctor
22738,thats funny my nose has stopped itching all the time i was tied up
22739,yes i know but its just that its a textbook example of displacement anxiety
22740,cant we go any faster theyre gaining on us
22741,are you sure
22742,i mean are you sure its firm
22743,oh i dont hate them fenner i just want them removed permanently i spent many years persuading the company to back this project and now that were on the verge of success im not going to be stopped by lilylivered sentimentalists wailing about the fate of a few primitive savages
22744,whats that
22745,hunted
22746,horrible
22747,whats that
22748,doctor
22749,look
22750,its gone
22751,what a good thing we remembered it reacts to movement
22752,kroll
22753,right now keep a track on that thing
22754,we must follow
22755,doctor
22756,if that rocket fires while youre in there
22757,doctor were too late come down
22758,we cant stop it now
22759,come down
22760,the master cutouts failed then you shot him for nothing didnt you didnt you
22761,doctor doctor are you all right
22762,yes i know
22763,minutes
22764,whats the matter
22765,so you came back
22766,what were you doing in there
22767,i wonder who opened it
22768,i havent got any time for any games so put your hands where i can see them and walk straight ahead
22769,what
22770,we promised kroll the lives of the two dryfoots who profaned his temple we failed to keep that promise i tell you kroll will not rest easily beneath these waters until he has eaten of their souls
22771,because we need as much help as we can get just take a look at that
22772,yes and its going to attack us
22773,if it had meant to attack us it would have come before going to the settlement
22774,its still coming
22775,kroll is allwise allseeing
22776,what are we going to do just sit here while that thing smashes this building to bits
22777,you have brought death to us all dryfoot
22778,theres nothing out here
22779,it doesnt know were here
22780,that door isnt going to hold its got us trapped
22781,yes why
22782,the fuel tank is only half full whats the idea
22783,i think its gone
22784,doctor ill start the compressors thatll make a racket then the emergency klaxon
22785,where are you going
22786,about what
22787,argh skart
22788,with that stick
22789,doctor
22790,theres something blocking the firing bay
22791,thats how it was designed the next shot is due in fifty seconds and its already started the countdown
22792,the manual override and abort are not functioning ive already tried
22793,cant you reconnect them
22794,forty seconds
22795,what
22796,doctor
22797,are you all right
22798,you could have been killed
22799,it is finished
22800,weve got a lot to do havent we doctor
22801,doctor
22802,no no doctor it was this way
22803,yes doctor
22804,doctor
22805,how did you know that the fifth segment was a part of kroll
22806,ah yes because according to the old book in the temple kroll had swallowed it
22807,hello
22808,what is it
22809,good heavens
22810,what bits of kroll
22811,there is a greater love men out there young men are dying for it dying so that atrios might live
22812,nor to zeos
22813,atrios and zeos the twin planets on the edge of the helical galaxy didnt they teach you anything at the academy
22814,no were going to atrios
22815,right
22816,how can the zeons develop something like that and not us whats gone wrong eh
22817,why not
22818,thats very odd
22819,better check the coordinates
22820,quite sure somethings gone astray
22821,zero zero eight zero one zero zero four zero
22822,but its millions of miles away
22823,and wheres zeos theres no sign of it
22824,the black guardian
22825,i wouldnt like to bet on it
22826,listen why dont you take us in on manual
22827,well theres still no sign of zeos but im picking up a reading for atrios twin
22828,look radiation levels you wouldnt believe
22829,but that means
22830,there must be a huge nuclear war going on down there
22831,well what else could it be
22832,because it usually happens
22833,it opted out  k9
22834,ah but what happens if it turns out not to be the worst after all
22835,or why
22836,why
22837,doctor look somethings approaching us from the planet surface
22838,what lets get out of here
22839,if you say so
22840,right ready
22841,oh no
22842,dont say what
22843,well i wonder how deep we are this time
22844,what did he say
22845,what how deep are we  k9
22846,what
22847,at close range from the front
22848,i dont think im going to like this place very much
22849,im with you all the way through there
22850,high radiation zone  k9
22851,doctor
22852,remember what we were saying about the black guardian
22853,very apt
22854,merak       astra
22855,theres a what
22856,who are you
22857,yes
22858,no
22859,that door leads to certain death
22860,youre obviously zeon spies
22861,no
22862,it would be much better for you to admit everything i arrested these two myself standing over the body of the princesss escort
22863,what is the purpose of your visit
22864,in the middle of a nuclear war
22865,for the last time what are you doing here
22866,everything youve told me is obviously a pack of lies its clear to me that you are zeon spies youve murdered one of my guards abducted the princess astra no doubt with the collusion of surgeon merak here unless you divulge her whereabouts you will be executed immediately as spies now is that clear
22867,well
22868,is that your last word
22869,yes
22870,stay where you are
22871,where to
22872,the tardis its gone
22873,then were trapped theres no way out
22874,yes and if one has time those guardll be after us any minute
22875,shush someones coming
22876,we dont know
22877,oh
22878,where where
22879,thats a high radiation zone
22880,who are you are you zeons
22881,yes
22882,right
22883,the marshal what makes you think hes involved
22884,astra and i were trying to make contact with the zeons to try and make peace the marshal knows he wants the war to go on of course
22885,well i knew i was in danger but i thought astra was safe the marshal always said that he needed her support her influence with the people
22886,none that i can think of no  k9
22887,shes not here
22888,then she was here
22889,then i will stay with her
22890,come on merak worrying wont help lets just get out of here before its too late
22891,nothing but a recycling shaft this areas been disused for years radiation leak
22892,well she cant have been there for very long but how did she get out
22893,on the other hand what
22894,scrap metal waste for the war effort everything metal gets put down the shaft to be recycled in the furnaces why
22895,where to
22896,i see
22897,you stop take them come on move
22898,the marshal wants to see you now
22899,those two wait over there you come with me
22900,major shapp this way
22901,hes meditating
22902,when things are not going well he makes most of his decisions this way
22903,a what
22904,welcome my friend
22905,a misunderstanding i apologise
22906,i had forgotten
22907,that you had been foretold your coming had been foretold
22908,its the war this endless war occupied my thoughts to the exclusion of all else
22909,now that you are here you are the one
22910,the one who will lead us to victory
22911,to halt the hated zeons in their tracks wipe their presence from our skies and free this land this world this atrios
22912,good good this blessed plot from the terrors of war and the evils of pestilence
22913,you doctor you shall give us our victory
22914,the question doesnt arise
22915,oh my dear doctor
22916,now doctor you shall see the mighty battlefleet of atrios the weapons that are available to you
22917,yes sir base to fleet commence attack attack attack attack  pilot
22918,it does the people no good to know the truth doctor they live on hope nothing else its been a long hard struggle production is slow losses are crippling but we fight on thats the main thing
22919,three ships left out of a once proud battlefleet of hundreds three you see now why we need your help we must have the weapon that will wipe the zeons clear of our skies once and for all can you provide it
22920,what is it
22921,very funny how can we have peace until we have the ultimate deterrent that will ensure a lasting peace
22922,use it of course make sure it works
22923,thank you
22924,i like you doctor
22925,it must be the ultimate deterrent
22926,what
22927,oh so we can attack they cant retaliate
22928,then how do we win
22929,we must have victory
22930,k9
22931,its too late sir its on the way to the furnace
22932,recycling we recycle all scrap
22933,oh oh k9 are you all right  k9
22934,hes not even singed my apologies doctor
22935,i do
22936,what do you mean
22937,go on
22938,oh absolutely theres no other way
22939,no doctor
22940,there are no prisoners this is war to the death like us the zeon warriors are sworn to destroy themselves death before dishonour
22941,intelligence reports suggest that shes been abducted by zeons if thats the case then im afraid
22942,certainly
22943,doctor when you went into the furnace after k9 the marshal almost went berserk at the thought you might be killed
22944,no it wasnt because what he said was the doctor must not die not yet
22945,and listen i saw something at his throat like a little black cylinder
22946,yes yes im sure of it
22947,yes if the marshals a puppet whos pulling the strings
22948,were no closer to finding astra or whatever it is youre looking for well are we
22949,a trap
22950,listen doctor you said a minute ago that we were close to finding astra please tell me where she is or where you think she is
22951,why not
22952,doctor youre forgetting something we havent been able to locate zeos not from the tardis or from anywhere
22953,why not
22954,no
22955,because your hands in oh you mean theres something between us and zeos
22956,that would account for the orbital shift but why cant we see whatevers in the way
22957,yes
22958,how can you be so sure
22959,who
22960,but astra said that she couldnt get a signal back from zeos where do we start
22961,wheres that doctor
22962,can we have that forcefield now weve committed everything were being obliterated weve nothing left its our last hope
22963,so ill give you absolute energy priority
22964,why
22965,then we are defenceless
22966,yes but you need zeons to experiment on
22967,there are no zeons
22968,what exactly are you proposing
22969,this forcefield can you provide it now will it give us breathing space
22970,wed better warn the doctor come on
22971,now doctor you are completely in my power
22972,now do you hear me doctor
22973,i am the shadow your adversary shall we say it is not important you come in quest of a key
22974,the key to time as it is called
22975,you are in possession of certain elements of that key
22976,i warn you doctor if you lie the pain will increase where are they
22977,where are they
22978,are they in there
22979,then you will open it
22980,now your quest is over you have something of shall we say interest to me in this machine of yours
22981,dont waste my time
22982,open the tardis bring me the pieces
22983,you are not dealing with a fool doctor
22984,bring me the first five segments of the key to time or i shall destroy you
22985,destroy him
22986,the key to time
22987,why not
22988,you think i would trust you
22989,no doctor there is no real difficulty i have waited so long even another thousand years would be nothing for me but you i have watched you and your jackdaw meanderings i know you and i know there is a want of patience in your nature
22990,exactly leave him he will make his own mistake then doctor i shall be waiting
22991,shapp shapp to control shapp to shapp shapp
22992,thats far enough doctor turn round hands in the air straighten up slowly
22993,all right what happened how did i get here
22994,transmat
22995,which section of atrios is this i dont recognise any of it
22996,zeos
22997,zeos how can we be on zeos no this must be a prohibited area section eleven b i mean it must be atrios
22998,well of course theres no bombardment the zeon fleet have just pulled out
22999,where are we
23000,er where are you off to
23001,are you sure this is zeos
23002,its very dusty
23003,its not irradiated
23004,and the airs clean but nobody could have been here for years
23005,not since the war started
23006,well of course we traded with them
23007,er much the same as us their clothes are different but apart from that
23008,not the ones i saw
23009,no why
23010,could be the result of biological warfare
23011,they must have been zeons i mean who else could they be
23012,oh they use disintegration capsules like we do
23013,yes yes could be useful  k9
23014,he seems in good fettle
23015,and then merak said he found this its astras the strange thing is it gives off a very faint signal on the tracer its obviously not the sixth segment so what is it
23016,whats wrong with k9
23017,what are bees
23018,what do you mean
23019,no zeons on zeos
23020,doctor please
23021,excellent prepare to attack
23022,itll counterattack
23023,so what will happen
23024,which he will
23025,excellent prepare to attack
23026,the third force
23027,astra you are to meet your lover smile
23028,and if i cant
23029,if the marshal refuses to listen
23030,if he insists on going ahead
23031,merak
23032,doctor
23033,do you think it was the shadow who built this
23034,well since there dont seem to be any zeons on zeos if you know what i mean presumably its the shadow whos got the princess
23035,what about between atrios and zeos do you remember
23036,right all we have to do is find it
23037,well if you can stop it
23038,what have you done
23039,and now its waiting to blow itself up  k9
23040,yes rather like sitting inside a time bomb
23041,its going to blow itself up
23042,missiles armed and targeted sir
23043,how did they manage to miss
23044,go in closer as close as you dare
23045,ah you put the five pieces together good
23046,yes
23047,now what
23048,if only we had the sixth piece
23049,what do you mean
23050,a gap
23051,oh
23052,wait for it man wait for the order
23053,ah what did you use
23054,is that compatible
23055,hang on let me just
23056,all right
23057,what
23058,doctor why isnt it affecting us
23059,so at the moment weve got absolute power over everything everywhere
23060,how long have we got k9  k9
23061,hang on if weve got so much power we ought to be able to localise it in some way that should help
23062,well if one has godlike powers one ought to be able to use them oughtnt one
23063,command it
23064,and the zeon computer room
23065,all power corrupts doctor
23066,i think we should move
23067,go with her bwahahahahaha
23068,doctor i found her this is astra she was captured by the zeons
23069,meraks told me about you
23070,i escaped
23071,i think one of the guards who was after me took a shot at him
23072,well they were coming after us but k9 chased them away
23073,i think merak needs some medical attention
23074,id feel safer with you
23075,hes right astra
23076,come on this way
23077,very odd
23078,he was on guard
23079,help theyre after me doctor
23080,doctor quickly
23081,i got him into the transmat shaft but they were on me before i could follow hes safe though
23082,doctor the time loop its stretched to about five seconds by the look of it
23083,if it goes on stretching and if the false piece lasts long enough listen ill get a fix on the third planet
23084,what is it
23085,yes perfectly
23086,no it means nothing to me
23087,the sixth piece
23088,got it
23089,go now
23090,yes weve got him exactly where he wants us
23091,how can we get the sixth piece without using the tracer or had you forgotten the tracers holding the key together and if we take the tracer out we break the time loop and without the time loop millions of people on zeos and atrios will die to say nothing of ourselves and the time loops stretching already its up to six seconds now thats four seconds left and how long will that thing last
23092,what im sorry i was lost
23093,i shall stay here
23094,what did you say are you all right
23095,i think so
23096,right
23097,leave her to astra follow the doctor  k9
23098,i think i remember now yes all these passages link up further on come on romana we shall meet him
23099,i know who you are doctor      shadow
23100,hello theet how you been boy
23101,begin
23102,come on theet class of ninety two

23105,yeah i was all right at practical remember
23106,temporal theory did me still you did well mind getting your doctorate and all that
23107,i failed didnt i still not to worry i was doing all right till this lot i went into repair and maintenance do anything anytime anywhere ive been all over the galaxy buy a bit do it up sell it
23108,cybernetics guidance systems you name it
23109,yeah and that not on a regular basis of course
23110,strictly under duress thats why im here the minute i finished the job wham feet never touched the ground
23111,i didnt know who he was did i just another customer i thought and then he puts the heavy word on do it or die i mean what would you have done

23151,your are inferior just as your powers are inferior once we have the key to time we shall set not two small planets but the two halves of the entire cosmos at war and their mutual destruction will be music in our ears unlike others it is not power we seek but destruction that we glory in fetch the key

23249,d�j� vu
23250,theres something you recognise
23251,shall we go back inside
23252,precious stones
23253,how modest
23254,a composite material gravel in a binding of possibly limestone and clay
23255,add water cement
23256,concrete
23257,doctor those tremors
23258,could they have destroyed it seems to be coming from over there
23259,i wonder what could have caused it
23260,it sounded like drilling what do you think it way
23261,a strange custom
23262,like the living dead
23263,how
23264,theyve gone ill keep watch
23265,yes you did what did you find out
23266,kantra kantras a tropical paradise
23267,whats a kantrian doing dying here
23268,its not surprising in a place like this
23269,look
23270,not specifically judging by design and size id say it had intergalactic range and time warp capability origin almost certainly star system 4x alpha 4
23271,whats it doing now ive never seen anything like that before
23272,for a place that looked dead theres a lot going on
23273,about a mile
23274,what were going down there
23275,these explosions where are they coming from
23276,why explosions
23277,here
23278,doctor
23279,are you all right
23280,no i cant move it without this block youd have been flattened youre lucky
23281,ill be as quick as i can
23282,will you be all right
23283,dont go away will you
23284,k9
23285,doctor
23286,it is an essential qualification that all crew members are in peak condition
23287,you dont know
23288,you made a forced landing
23289,not a world one would visit from choice
23290,the planet is listed in our star catalogue as d5 gamma zed alpha
23291,i believe the planet is called skaro
23292,you know it
23293,the nature of our mission is secret youll understand im sure
23294,the prisoner will be taken to interrogation
23295,why what do you know of skaro
23296,very well i dont see why this should compromise us our mission is directed against the force known as the daleks a race of evil auto
23297,you know the daleks
23298,yes
23299,that is precisely what i would like to know too
23300,proceed
23301,i was left for dead ive been on the run for days
23302,i spotted you and the girl
23303,she seemed afraid she backed away and fell down a shaft
23304,she was alive
23305,but the daleks got her
23306,i went to help her they took her away
23307,youd be taking a tremendous risk
23308,i think so
23309,okay its all clear come on
23310,no ill stay ive nothing to lose ever since i was brought here ive had an awful premonition id die on skaro
23311,but why should the daleks come here doctor what is the connection
23312,that doesnt tell me why they should return
23313,you have an idea
23314,the main control centre about five hundred metres up there
23315,the place will be crawling with daleks
23316,you stay and cover this exit lan we may need to get out of here in a hurry
23317,agella cover this entrance
23318,explosives and timers powerful too they use them in the excavations
23319,kaled
23320,yes but what is it
23321,perhaps its been destroyed
23322,intruders intruders    dalek 2
23323,no
23324,he is dead
23325,we cannot allow aliens to see us in death it is against against our code of honour im sure you understand
23326,whats all that about
23327,what about your friend
23328,no doctor after you
23329,seek locate exterminate seek locate exterminate
23330,guard this position i will inform control
23331,well the only way to escape the daleks was to feign death its lucky they didnt know i was a gallifreyan
23332,one for casual one for best
23333,doctor
23334,where are you going
23335,no doctor i will go back to the ship agella will go with you were as anxious to find what the daleks are looking for as you are
23336,how did you know how to get into this level
23337,what is it were looking for
23338,whats that
23339,advise space command that our mission is almost complete
23340,a humanoid
23341,he created the daleks
23342,this creature looks as though hes been dead for centuries
23343,so thats what the daleks have been looking for their creator
23344,doctor
23345,dead i do not die mark this moment doctor in the history of the universe this moment is unique davros lives
23346,you will release me you will return me to the daleks
23347,i didnt do it very well
23348,the corridors full of daleks
23349,that wouldnt keep out a determined mouse
23350,well be as quick as we can
23351,well
23352,doctor
23353,do you believe your puny efforts can change the course of destiny
23354,destiny doctor
23355,invincible necessity
23356,the universe
23357,errors of the past will be rectified i will add new design elements to the daleks circuitry they will be armed with new weaponry weaponry so devastating that all matter will succumb to its power i will equip them with all the knowledge of the universe
23358,the daleks need me
23359,okay
23360,your inevitable destruction
23361,ha there was damage to my primary life support system the secondary and backup circuits switched in immediately synthetic tissue regeneration took place whilst bodily organs were held in longterm suspension
23362,until the daleks universal supremacy is accomplished i cannot allow myself the luxury of death
23363,however it is a luxury i shall delight in bestowing upon you
23364,since my entombment i have no knowledge of the advancement of my daleks of course they have achieved great things
23365,only the beginning now i have returned the campaign will begin in earnest i have slept but now i have awakened and the universe will be sorry
23366,armed with new technology i will    dalek 2
23367,he is holding a primed explosive device
23368,he is simply buying time do as he says
23369,ha how long do you think you can sustain your advantage alone and against such odds
23370,attention attention the action we are about to take is your responsibility it will cease only when you agree to total surrender
23371,exterminate
23372,you surrender
23373,state them
23374,continue
23375,conditions unacceptable exterminations will continue
23376,logic unacceptable detonation would also destroy you
23377,the workers have been released
23378,you need not elaborate doctor
23379,well meet again doctor never doubt it well meet again
23380,seek and locate seek and locate  dalek 3
23381,doctor doctor
23382,ive been looking for you its hard to move around though there are dalek patrols everywhere
23383,i found the other prisoners they told me what youd done to free them theyre very grateful
23384,hiding if we can lay our hands on some weapons im hoping to turn them into some sort of fighting force
23385,remain where you are you will turn and walk ahead of me if you make any attempt to escape you will be extermi
23386,you will accompany me back to our spacecraft
23387,that is not a request it is an order move
23388,what the devil why did she turn against you
23389,what are you doing
23390,excellent unfortunately our attempts to capture the doctor have failed so far what we need is some way to get him out into the open take her
23391,understood
23392,welcome back doctor
23393,shell recover
23394,tell me doctor when did you first realise we were robotic
23395,agella
23396,disfunction or death as you know it only occurs in us with massive circuitry disturbance we are infinitely superior
23397,we function logically
23398,why doctor
23399,yes
23400,yes doctor
23401,you will reprogramme our battle computers for us the movellans will be exterminated
23402,ha stone blunts scissors
23403,were perfectly
23404,our objective is victory doctor the destruction of the dalek fleet
23405,paper
23406,stone
23407,scissors
23408,stone
23409,scissors
23410,and the daleks want the same thing
23411,when we reach the fleet you will reprogramme our computers
23412,yes the dalek fleet will be wiped from the heavens and nothing will stand in our way of the conquest of the galaxy
23413,scissors cuts paper  lets get out
23414,stalemate  do something
23415,good plan scissors cuts paper paper wraps
23416,jelly baby
23417,total dalek victory then on to still greater conquests i will lead davros will lead
23418,what did i say
23419,yes
23420,you tell him
23421,what
23422,these are movellan minds
23423,orders for the day and the power to carry them out
23424,nothing
23425,weve only got a handful of men how can we stop him
23426,why
23427,doctor
23428,i have one more thing to do before i leave it seems we have both been much in demand doctor
23429,putting aside our differences for a moment
23430,speaking simply as scientists the problem is fascinating dont you agree
23431,two spacefleets totally impotent
23432,you know how the stalemate can be broken of course
23433,i realised you would so obvious but they cant see it would you have told the movellans
23434,i suspected you wouldnt
23435,but i dared not take the risk i had to stop them taking you
23436,the movellan ship will never lift off soon my daleks carrying more than half a megaton of explosives will press against the hull and i will simply activate this control to detonate
23437,i would not
23438,when the dalek ship arrives you will accompany us
23439,malfunction loss of control loss of control loss of control
23440,keep away
23441,keep back
23442,perfectly
23443,theyre not slaves to it like the daleks or the movellans
23444,i have failed
23445,there is not a ship not a prison that can hold me
23446,doctor doctor
23447,doctor could you really have solved their problems and won the war for them
23448,was it
23449,so the first side that switches its computer off and does something irrational
23450,brilliant
23451,is that why you always win
23452,because you always make mistakes
23453,what will happen if  jagaroth
23454,yes marvellous
23455,absolutely marvellous
23456,so do i though its not quite as you described it
23457,you said it was nice

23484,mmm just a twinge i didnt like it
23485,dont be so portentous
23486,well at least on gallifrey we can capture a good likeness computers can draw
23487,what about the time slip
23488,nonsense what about the academia stellaris on sirius five
23489,or the solariun pinaquotheque at strikian
23490,or the braxiatel collection

23521,count scarlioni
23522,everyone on earths heard of count scarlioni
23523,right fine thats it i give up youre crazy
23524,masterpieces that have apparently been missing over the centuries are just turning up all over the place
23525,theyre very very good ones they stand up to every scientific test
23526,yes
23527,nothing dirty can be proved though hes clean absolutely clean so clean he stinks
23528,whats that bracelet worth
23529,what
23530,yes my lady
23531,doctor youre being very pleasant with me
23532,but i didnt invite you here for social reasons
23533,the only reason you were brought here was to explain exactly why you stole my bracelet
23534,very interesting
23535,i was rather under the impression that mister duggan was following me
23536,who sent you
23537,doctor the more you try to convince me that youre a fool the more im likely to think otherwise now it would only be the work of a moment to have you killed
23538,my dear these are the people who stole it from me at the louvre
23539,how very curious two thieves enter the louvre gallery and come out with a bracelet couldnt you think of anything more interesting to steal
23540,yes it would so you stole the bracelet simply because its pretty
23541,my dear nobody could be as stupid as he seems
23542,this interview is at an end
23543,i think a rather better idea would be if hermann were to lock you into the cellar i should hate to lose contact with such fascinating people
23544,but youre not going to let them lock us up
23545,thank you
23546,you really should be more careful with your trinkets my dear after all we do have a mona lisa to steal
23547,long enough
23548,may have been
23549,doctor your boring conversation does not interest me

23629,youve heard of us
23630,four hundred million years i think is the figure youre looking for
23631,surviving the prime motive of all species we were not all destroyed a few of us escaped in a crippled spacecraft and made planetfall in this world in its primeval time we found it uninhabitable
23632,we tried to leave but the ship disintegrated i was fractured splinters of my being are scattered in time all identical none complete i am not satisfied with your explanation how do you travel through time
23633,what is that box
23634,that box
23635,i can see that you are a dangerously clever man doctor i think its time we conducted this conversation somewhat more formally
23636,hold him here while i collect the instruments of torture if he wags his tongue confiscate it

23667,tinkering every man must have his hobby
23668,excuse me my lady doctor the count is very anxious to see you in the cellar

23670,doctor get me out of here
23671,and why do you say that
23672,oh no on the contrary doctor youre going to help me
23673,you are indeed and if you do not itll be so much the worse for you for this young lady and for thousands of other people i could mention if i happened to have the paris telephone directory on my person
23674,what else do you ever do
23675,doctor i think we can dispense both with your interference and with your help your friend has done her work very well indeed
23676,jagaroth
23677,whats a jagaroth
23678,so thats why he had to go back in time he had to reverse history in order to save the jagaroth race and ive made that possible
23679,it doesnt travel in time it just goes forwards or backwards in its own lifecycle if hed got in it hed just have become a baby again
23680,of course
23681,but without the stabiliser he couldnt have been there himself to save his ship yeah but how would he get the power it would be fantastic
23682,the mona lisas
23683,why not
23684,doctor there wont be any xrays for it to show up on if he gets back to that ship
23685,wait a minute when i made that component i rigged it so that it could only go back in time for two minutes after that hed be catapulted back to his own time here now he couldnt do any harm
23686,we must do something to stop him
23687,what
23688,you now see me as i truly am
23689,and you will see the culmination of my lives work

23739,its huge
23740,what kind of bird laid that
23741,what do you think it was then
23742,what is it
23743,what
23744,oh dont be ridiculous
23745,what is it
23746,in an eggshell
23747,stands to reason
23748,yes its definitely the shell thats the transmitter i wonder what its transmitting and to whom well i suppose to whatever laid it hmm thats not a very pleasant thought is it doctor
23749,yes
23750,kill him
23751,kill him
23752,wait
23753,i am
23754,wolfweeds
23755,of course specially grown in the lady adrastas nurseries
23756,what are you doing in the place of death
23757,because anyone found here is automatically condemned to death
23758,your commander says this is yours
23759,what is it
23760,what does it do
23761,i hope youre not lying doctor the lady adrasta will want to question you
23762,i dont know at least were still alive
23763,no talking
23764,silence
23765,and lead us into another ambush no huntsman
23766,bandits these hills are full of them no travellers safe unless you want to get your throat cut youd better keep up with us
23767,wait there
23768,doctor
23769,perhaps i can be of help
23770,i so like my guests to feel comfortable
23771,it doesnt seem to have incommoded you too much doctor
23772,and youre the fellow who was found in the place of death
23773,anyone found there is put to death
23774,tell me what did you make of the object some of the finest brains on chloris have devoted years to trying to unravel the problem
23775,egg
23776,are you sure
23777,have you seen anything like it before
23778,what kind of creature laid it
23779,ah yes madam karela told me your commander
23780,of course i couldnt see a man of your obvious talents in a subordinate position
23781,dont worry doctor my wolfweeds will hunt down those animals that took romana
23782,the wolfweeds
23783,kill her quickly if shes lucky
23784,doctor you said you had some theories about this eggshell
23785,later doctor about the eggshell
23786,we discovered it about fifteen years ago the shell doctor
23787,yes my huntsman heard you say that the shell was alive
23788,the shell then why can no one hear it
23789,whats the shell screaming about
23790,yes my lady
23791,engineers doran and tollund
23792,our task is to discover the function of the object that you mistakenly called an eggshell
23793,well engineer doran in his latest paper on the subject has proved conclusively that it is part of an ancient building perhaps a temple
23794,youre not convinced doctor
23795,you still think its a shell
23796,well i myself have calculated that a bird large enough to lay that egg would have to have a wingspan of at least a mile
23797,well do you know many birds that large
23798,big fish
23799,mmm yes
23800,really doctor how do you account for the marks of intense heat on the exterior of the shell
23801,my lady this man is being facetious
23802,hes mistaken
23803,my lady i beg you no please no
23804,perhaps you will find it instructive
23805,doctor you know more about the shell than youre prepared to say perhaps a little demonstration will make you more cooperative bring him
23806,we call it the pit
23807,no no please i beg you please
23808,really
23809,now doctor are you prepared to be cooperative  romana
23810,if i were you my dear i would pray that he was dead already then he would at least be spared the stress of being eaten alive    adrasta
23811,pity you were such a fool doctor i could have used you too
23812,dont worry my dear well keep every piece of precious metal
23813,ah finally here we are make yourself at home well comfortable if you can
23814,oh dont mention it sir as my dear mother always used to say born under the sign of patus middle cusp she was if you can help anybody like preventing them from being eaten by a monster then do so they might be grateful so i did
23815,organon sir
23816,astrologer extraordinary seer to princes and emperors the future foretold the past explained the present apologised for
23817,a small matter of a slight error in a prophecy
23818,why are you in the business yourself sir
23819,seeing into the future
23820,crystal ball man are you or do you favour goat entrails
23821,a police box affair
23822,oh youve met her
23823,a difficult woman very literal mind i told her that she would have visitors from beyond the stars
23824,i see a creature coming to you from beyond the stars ive done it in all the courts on the planet it usually goes down very well
23825,oh she grew very nasty what sort of creature she wanted to know well i stalled a bit you know a little professional
23826,discretion
23827,and she threw me down here with that thing where are you from
23828,oh so i was right
23829,and then adrasta grew nasty with you and threw you down here as well
23830,jumped
23831,i should say so was she frightened of you
23832,yes thats exactly what were going to do get your weapons my lovely boys were going visiting
23833,yes ive managed to avoid it so far ive been lucky
23834,yes they were lying around it used to be mines you know but theyve been worked out metal is very scarce up there very precious
23835,seems to suit the lady adrasta well enough though
23836,she owns the only mine there is
23837,yes this one well thats the point dont you see although its been worked dry all the metal on the planet came out of it and it all belongs to her
23838,yes its the source of her power
23839,she depends on it
23840,oh my horoscope said id be useful to somebody today i thought perhaps it was going to be to that
23841,huge
23842,perhaps two
23843,yes i sometimes thing that its singing
23844,yes whos to tell except another creature and theres only one like that thank heaven
23845,of course im sure theres only that one on this planet
23846,oh yes ive travelled im one of the few who has most of the country is impenetrable forest or jungle
23847,it may be pretty to you but its the very devil to live in no metal means no tools
23848,oh oh well he didnt like that did he
23849,i bet he wont come back here again in a hurry
23850,doctor what sign were you born under aquatrio
23851,capris
23852,oh ariel
23853,oh if only i had my charts here i could have told you your horoscope im sure this was your lucky day
23854,no thank you i was trying to avoid it examining mine
23855,what
23856,its a huge brain
23857,what about the rest of it the arms the legs the body
23858,you mean go after it
23859,shush where is it
23860,what am i doing here
23861,what
23862,who can read such mysteries perhaps it was written in the stars
23863,what
23864,ahem what do we do when we find the monster have you thought of that
23865,you dont know what do you mean you dont know
23866,well havent you got a plan
23867,well then
23868,doctor come back
23869,i hope for the doctors sake you are strong enough and strong enough to kill the creature too come on  k9
23870,quick quick all of you down here maybe it leads to adrastas treasure vaults
23871,no wait were not going to do it like that we must think
23872,doctor are you all right
23873,i was so worried about you
23874,how many have you got through then
23875,how did you do it
23876,i demand you tell me how you broke through the shell
23877,your lucks still holding out
23878,you must have been born under a particularly favourable conjunction of celestial circumstances
23879,what sign were you born under
23880,crossed what
23881,why did it let you get away why didnt it kill you
23882,you ask too many questions doctor karela take the girl the tin animal and some men you know what to do
23883,afraid for the creature doctor
23884,i know one thing doctor it cant get out of this pit by itself go on karela hold him in case he tries to warn his creeping friend dog  k9
23885,all right k9 ill carry you
23886,be silent
23887,i take back what i said about this being your lucky day
23888,i think on second thoughts it may be the monsters
23889,i wonder what sign it was born under
23890,oh
23891,adrastas evil eye is on me
23892,how far away was the creature when you saw it
23893,we should have heard something by now
23894,oh why me
23895,if you dont go my friend that guard standing behind you will cut your throat from ear to ear
23896,i dont know i sent the guards down after it
23897,karela take the girl the tin animal and some guards go down into the pit find the creature and kill it
23898,what
23899,then doctor you had better make sure that k9 manages to kill it
23900,dont try to be clever doctor k9 is quite capable of killing the tythonian
23901,the creature
23902,i meant the creature
23903,doctor i mean to have that creature dead romana will make k9 kill it
23904,then karela will kill her point the dog against the rock
23905,doctor i cant do anything about my hair if im holding k9
23906,no get away from me ah
23907,dont let it get me you mustnt let that thing get me itll kill me
23908,keep it away from me its its going to eat me
23909,she did indeed
23910,now doctor i mean to have that creature dead romana train k9s ray on it now
23911,adrasta
23912,if she moves blast her  k9
23913,hello
23914,guard quickly summon the huntsman move
23915,what do you mean
23916,what are you talking about
23917,doctor whats happening
23918,you didnt say what
23919,i beg your pardon
23920,about this being a frightening experience but dont be alarmed
23921,you didnt
23922,but if you didnt say it who did
23923,then what are you doing here skulking about in a pit eating people
23924,you were just saying
23925,doctor order your dog to kill the tythonian
23926,if you do not your friend organon dies
23927,doctor
23928,huntsman set the wolfweeds on the doctor
23929,dont listen to him its just the ravings of a demented space tramp set the wolfweeds on him
23930,have a care doctor
23931,let him speak
23932,theyre not
23933,fools you listen to the opinions of an electric dog
23934,so erato came here to offer you metal in return for chlorophyll of course
23935,the person who held the monopoly of metal here
23936,not a word of it its a pack of lies
23937,that wont prove anything you just take hold of that thing and say exactly what you like you expect intelligent people to fall for your childish tricks
23938,no back back
23939,yes so i think have we
23940,yes and with her die the dark ages for this planet
23941,im sorry for all the unpleasantness but thank you for the weeds
23942,they are the first solid meal ive had in fifteen years i wonder if you could arrange to have me hoisted out of the pit
23943,thank you doctor
23944,why not
23945,nonsense he probably checked out your horoscope earlier
23946,all of him
23947,what you mean he hasnt been telling us the truth
23948,well then do you think its safe to let him out of the pit if you think hes been lying to us
23949,well we dont want several hundred cubic feet of angry blob heaving itself round the country crushing people
23950,well he crushed quite a few down the pit
23951,talk
23952,but we dont know anything about him we dont even know how he got here
23953,in an egg
23954,well i didnt see a photon drive
23955,how
23956,doctor
23957,that shell
23958,when we first landed it was making a noise
23959,could it have been a distress signal perhaps it was calling for help
23960,so fifteen years in the pit for one of them would be no more than the wink of an eye
23961,danger
23962,and erato wants to be out of the pit and free to escape in his craft before something dreadful happens
23963,but doctor youve played right into his hands youve let him go
23964,cant you say anything but yes the whole time
23965,yes
23966,yes
23967,you mean without that segment erato cant leave the planet
23968,and chloris gets all the metal it needs
23969,the guards are coming now dont risk it all by being greedy for one more piece now come on this way
23970,the creatures been removed from the pit
23971,its waiting at the side door if youre ready to speak to it again
23972,oh thank you thank you
23973,this way doctor
23974,what i have to tell you is no more pleasant for me than it will be for you but it has passed beyond my
23975,what
23976,i came as an ambassador to buy chlorophyll but adrasta imprisoned me however she failed to prevent the other half of my ship from communicating that fact to my brothers on tythonus they will have taken that as an act of aggression and responded accordingly
23977,once the stars are set in their courses
23978,i assure you i mean my words quite literally the star i refer to is a neutron star
23979,a neutron star  k9
23980,is that bad doctor
23981,but surely
23982,if you will excuse me i will leave now i have no wish to witness this distressing finale
23983,no matter it wont take long to spin up a new ship round the vital components
23984,i feel this is immaterial to
23985,twenty six ninods
23986,the principle is the same
23987,this idea is madness doctor
23988,and how do you propose to do this yanking doctor
23989,and the thing will go spinning off harmlessly into deep space
23990,let me remind you doctor that i came here to offer help to the planet of chloris they imprisoned me in a pit and starved me for fifteen years i am disinclined to commit suicide on their behalf
23991,you may be right doctor
23992,i will help you
23993,a moment please doctor what would you have done if i had decided to abandon you
23994,what do you mean
23995,if it stays hidden but is that a chance you want to take particularly since the alternative im offering you is the certainty of wealth and power if you join with me in seizing hold of it the monopoly will stay in our hands and with it then control of the whole planet well
23996,what are you talking about doctor you two kill him
23997,youre bluffing doctor
23998,thats a chance im prepared to take
23999,yes
24000,yes
24001,no no no youre destroying our metal
24002,i can hear you doctor preparing for takeoff
24003,yes doctor on band six
24004,doctor ive been calculating our chances of success
24005,very wise
24006,i know
24007,i am ready doctor
24008,doctor
24009,doctor
24010,you must hold the star im being dragged towards it
24011,were placing a terrible strain on the tardis
24012,you can turn off your gravity beam in five of your seconds
24013,doctor what happened
24014,what
24015,weve got to dematerialise
24016,so do i though i did calculate our changes of success at seventy four million three hundred and eighty four thousand three hundred and thirty eight to one against
24017,why
24018,i dont know but its tall and dark and
24019,doctor
24020,yes
24021,oh its all your fault secker ill carry the can ill lose my job but you youll never work in west galaxy again go on check the power man come on move yourself this is an emergency
24022,fascinating
24023,why wasnt there an explosion
24024,i dont think we should interfere
24025,who was that
24026,shall we follow
24027,i was given complete clearance from azure control you were off course
24028,what are you a passenger
24029,howd you do whats that

24031,oh yes my names rigg captain rigg
24032,yes er this is mister dymond the owner of the other vehicle involved in the er incident
24033,salvage you say
24034,yes well i cant discuss anything until ive spoken to the company
24035,impossible
24036,if its possible to get into the situation theoretically it should be possible to get out of it
24037,but look at the time of the collision this ship was partially dematerialised
24038,its just a question of exciting the molecules put your ship on full thrust
24039,well its worked before you know
24040,yes well it might work if i could get any power
24041,of course i am
24042,thats nice coming from someone whos just crashed into it ill risk it
24043,seckerll show you secker take the doctor to the power unit
24044,you go down here to section five then left into the shuttlebay and down to level b you cant miss it
24045,ive told you havent i whats the difference im busy

24047,back so soon
24048,what about him
24049,yes well he has been behaving rather strangely seems to be in a different world
24050,doctor this is the milk run station nine to azure azure to station nine a straight charter for the whole season
24051,no doctor theyve all had prevocation checks the azurian authorities insist on it
24052,tryst
24053,yes a zoologist he arrived at station nine after a long expedition with his equipment and hes looking for a holiday
24054,well all over oh but hes all right we checked him over
24055,yes and id like to know just who you are
24056,yes
24057,galactic went out of business twenty years ago
24058,now thats not good enough
24059,well hes in the first class lounge
24060,yes and
24061,well yes of course i do
24062,we went through the cygnus gap
24063,and then we did a slingshot over to a small system just three planets m37 you know
24064,the second planet supports life in a very early stage of evolution the molluscs the algae the primitive insects i can show you
24065,here you are a copy of my log i published it to go with my lectures
24066,yes the name of my ship
24067,professor stein
24068,oh a dear friend he was my mentor we worked on this idea together before he died of course then we stopped you knew him
24069,doctor doctor doctor all very well reminiscing but dont we have an urgent problem to deal with im anxious to be on my way
24070,yes you see i didnt actually expect a spaceliner to materialise halfway through my ship today
24071,doctor we cant locate secker my men are still looking
24072,well yes all right
24073,yes
24074,zoo
24075,no doctor this is important scientific research i am helping to conserve endangered species
24076,oh yes
24077,he died
24078,are you certain
24079,what
24080,like a tissue transplant you mean
24081,well we can try from below the shuttlebay well have to cut our way through i could put in a request for lasers have them sent up from azure
24082,we wont be able to make it doctor the place to cut through is beyond that overlap
24083,what the devil did that
24084,medics level four meet you at the elevator move
24085,lets get him to the sickbay quick
24086,how far  k9
24087,what  k9
24088,has something been stolen
24089,vraxoin
24090,i thought that was stamped out long ago
24091,the only known source was destroyed wasnt it
24092,so have i
24093,no not the lift the cet machine
24094,it doesnt just take recordings
24095,so hes left bald patches on the planets hes visited
24096,i hope so
24097,killed him
24098,seckers dead they couldnt save him
24099,i asked tryst but he couldnt help either
24100,its a pity we cant get further up there and i dont want to damage an airseal or cut through a stress point
24101,very handy that machine of yours doctor
24102,what the devil was that
24103,and what in the name of the suns is it doing on board the ship first a collision then a dead navigator and now a monster roaming about my ship its totally inexplicable
24104,then explain it
24105,it must have been that that got secker
24106,what do you mean
24107,none of my passengers could have brought it on board the ship
24108,no ive scanned it still ill scan the empress again
24109,yes its bad stuff
24110,your people knew it would be on board did they
24111,well youre an agent arent you
24112,yes but who do you work for
24113,if theres any vraxoin on board itll show up on the scan
24114,every nook and cranny nothing in the forward section
24115,who
24116,nothing
24117,no no no
24118,well any shield would be too small to hide any useful quantity of the stuff
24119,but this drug is hardly our most pressing problem
24120,yes but how to get through to the power unit
24121,your ship
24122,yes where is your ship by the way
24123,well there you go again how do i know i can trust you
24124,oh thats hardly the point
24125,all right what do you want me to do
24126,thanks
24127,yes there isnt any evidence to back up his suspicions there isnt a trace of any drug anywhere on the ship at all still i think thats the least of our worries
24128,yes
24129,a planet called eden
24130,do you know it
24131,ah doctor i have a message for you oh im so delighted that you are taking an interest in my cet machine
24132,yes well it is rather impressive isnt it
24133,well i value your opinion doctor
24134,it does
24135,well what do you think is so wrong
24136,yes
24137,er the what
24138,yes yes all right doctor in spite of your interest i have decided to shut it off until ive had a chance to make some adjustments
24139,yes no no and it doesnt matter what you are saying im going to switch it off
24140,yes oh i nearly forgot
24141,the message the separation of the ships dymond is waiting for you
24142,yeah i know i know i know i mean thats funny in itself isnt it
24143,where are you going to be doctor
24144,oh be my guest
24145,well ill leave you to it doctor im thirsty
24146,whats going on
24147,when are we going to land weve been stuck for ages how much longer
24148,hey hey its them theyre the ones who are doing the drug smuggling you know so the doctor isnt going to do anything at all right
24149,what if she is i mean i dont care what does it matter i mean nothing matters at all
24150,doctor are you all right theres a creature in there its horrible weve got to get away what were you doing in there come on
24151,you mean youve been right through to the other side
24152,well someone shot at that creature and drove it off
24153,trysts ship
24154,of course
24155,a stowaway
24156,hes hit the bottle
24157,he doesnt care about anything anymore he just laughs and giggles the whole time sick grin on his face
24158,vraxoin where from
24159,what do you want to do
24160,ah doctor doctor rigg has told me about the drugs
24161,yes doctor i believe i can help you over this problem
24162,yes er
24163,doctor im very sad to say that i think the drugs were smuggled on board my ship and im pretty certain i know who it was
24164,yes one of my crew but he was killed but i think he passed the drugs on before he died
24165,yes to della
24166,i question her of course but she wouldnt admit it
24167,doctor    dymond
24168,ah doctor this is waterguard fisk and landing officer costa of the azurian excise ive been telling them
24169,can i see your ident plaque
24170,let me see it now
24171,i havent got one
24172,thats extremely serious
24173,romana who
24174,name and date of birth
24175,your name and date of birth
24176,we wouldnt want to
24177,all in good time
24178,shes clean
24179,so the criminals must be caught eh doctor
24180,youre under arrest
24181,well
24182,its running
24183,now what do we do
24184,but we cant its unstable
24185,well get torn apart
24186,i dont
24187,which way
24188,how do you know which way is east
24189,why not call it north
24190,northeast
24191,how did you know we could get into the projection
24192,a relative dimensional field
24193,its restructured on an intradimensional matrix
24194,so without the dimensional osmosis damper everything gets mixed up together and we can just walk straight into the projection
24195,and anything else can just walk straight out
24196,ive never met such idiots as those customs men
24197,yes
24198,dinner
24199,doctor
24200,root
24201,are you all right
24202,lets get out of here
24203,doctor
24204,what was that
24205,the names stott
24206,yes
24207,i know a safe place follow me
24208,mandrel doctor theyre called mandrels
24209,yes i thought i was going to be stuck here for the rest of my life there were a few times when i felt like blowing my brains out the hardest thing was being able to look out and see della
24210,after the accident something must have gone wrong with the cet machine the edge of the projection was shimmering
24211,i decided i had nothing to lose so i walked straight through it and found myself on the empress then i took one of the passenger coveralls so i could walk about unnoticed
24212,because of what i am and what im doing
24213,im a major in the intelligence section of space corps on a special assignment to find out whos drug running
24214,he must have arranged somewhere along the line for a pickup theyd have to get the stuff out of the projection and pass it on
24215,just a tiny sample secker must have found it he may even have been involved himself
24216,all i know is that its in eden somewhere ive been searching all this time no result
24217,and whats that
24218,yes you can get out of the projection any way you want
24219,look out doctor
24220,what is it
24221,doctor do you really know how to get this thing going
24222,what for
24223,would a toothpick do
24224,mandrels k9  k9
24225,hadnt we better deal with them first
24226,sieve
24227,theyre only economy class whats all the fuss about
24228,mandrel
24229,doctor theyre coming from both ways
24230,yes im pretty sure it was that one
24231,if you say so
24232,no sorry its the one below
24233,all ready to go now
24234,all right
24235,hes a criminal isnt he what else do you do with criminals  crewman
24236,what about you youre not going to be here when the power unit comes on are you
24237,certainly
24238,what about the mandrels you wont have k9 or a gun
24239,look out
24240,right  stott turns back romana runs out of the projection and through the lounge
24241,you found the traces of vrax in the doctors pocket what more do you want        k9
24242,first of all wed better find the doctor
24243,what is it k9  k9
24244,hello doctor
24245,what happened to you
24246,well youd better tell fisk about it come on
24247,theyve had orders to shoot
24248,an inchuka laser can be used to carry thousands of telecom messages
24249,from what ive seen of trysts set up i should think so why
24250,then tryst and dymond are the smugglers
24251,what happened to you doctor
24252,who
24253,tryst
24254,the mandrels
24255,a powder you mean
24256,no wonder i couldnt find it
24257,can you prove it
24258,how
24259,put your hands up doctor
24260,thank you k9 that was close  k9
24261,dymond shot della shes wounded but shell be all right
24262,theres no pilot no navigating officer could you fly her
24263,tryst and dymond have got away
24264,to do what
24265,good isnt it
24266,yes but what does it mean
24267,yes but what are we going to do
24268,the guns are fading
24269,no
24270,what now
24271,what this
24272,cet
24273,are you joking
24274,up five points
24275,we could put the jump leads on k9
24276,what are you hoping to achieve
24277,ten and building
24278,are you all right
24279,that means theyll get away
24280,theyve made the transfer
24281,theyll get away
24282,good weve done it lets get out of here      k9
24283,whats happened
24284,yes but you havent done anything
24285,so doctor your plan has failed miserably theres no way we can catch them now
24286,doctor doctor i didnt want to be involved in all this tell them tell them that i only did it for the sake of funding my research you understand all this youre a scientist
24287,what
24288,im fine now thank you doctor im relieved the nightmares over
24289,it never was meant to be a zoo it really was a conservation exercise for most of us
24290,what about the mandrels and the vraxoin
24291,of course i will
24292,he could be right you know
24293,doctor
24294,very fast
24295,doctor what have you been doing
24296,this is an old ship
24297,dont you think thats a bit dangerous
24298,a gravitational field
24299,but doctor we are moving
24300,what
24301,youve immobilised the dematerialisation circuits
24302,it may be black but we are moving very fast
24303,are we falling into a black hole
24304,i hope youre right because we cant dematerialise
24305,dont stand there wondering do something
24306,put it together again
24307,only can you fix them
24308,which is exactly what we dont have
24309,there is something its tiny how can something so minute have such an enormous gravitational pull
24310,you mean we have no defence shields
24311,where
24312,its not going to be easy to get across there
24313,how
24314,well done doctor
24315,doctor
24316,hymetusite
24317,hymetusite is highly radioactive
24318,i suppose its some sort of freighter
24319,i wonder where it was heading
24320,who are you
24321,he is prince of aneth
24322,youve been to aneth
24323,where are we now
24324,skonnos
24325,we are the bearers of aneths tribute to the nimon
24326,we are the bearers of aneths tribute to the nimon
24327,we were on our way to skonnos when something went wrong with the ship
24328,it felt as if it went out of control there was a crash then silence and here we are
24329,whats that
24330,a gravity whirlpool
24331,yes
24332,what
24333,can it be done
24334,is it my imagination or is the gravity increasing all the time
24335,whats happening
24336,a mathematical point with no dimensions
24337,i am
24338,who are you what are you doing with the sacrifices
24339,sacrifices to the nimon who are you space pirates
24340,why should i believe that
24341,can you
24342,through there
24343,through there
24344,weakling scum
24345,the pilot
24346,hes dead
24347,he crashed the ship
24348,the anethans i have to get them safely to skonnos whatever happens they are our payment in the great contract
24349,the nimon will have to be informed
24350,this is a battleship of the first skonnon empire it will soon be replaced
24351,sounds like the tardis
24352,can you make it work
24353,can you make it work
24354,can you make it work
24355,a what
24356,do you think we have enough power
24357,what about the hymetusite if we could convert the engines its an immensely rich energy source
24358,oh you will doctor you will
24359,dont you play the fool with me doctor
24360,i think its possible youre right though its a strange mixture of technologies up here
24361,i shall know what to do with it
24362,er no thank you ive made my own
24363,er doctor
24364,in the name of the second skonnon empire
24365,its getting worse
24366,then what
24367,all right
24368,plug the gravitic anomoliser into the main circuit
24369,what are you going to do
24370,is that safe
24371,its going to be all right we just have to wait for the doctor
24372,in flight but the doctor isnt back on board yet the pilot was meant to wait oh why didnt you tell me we were moving      k9
24373,you dare disturb me at this time    k9
24374,your friend can rot in his black hole for all i care
24375,weakling scum
24376,and now the rest of them including her
24377,yes
24378,ah good morning or is it evening here lovely day isnt it wasnt it no
24379,what is this
24380,the doctor
24381,dropped in
24382,i am
24383,release him
24384,neutrino converter
24385,what do you know about such matters
24386,oh come now doctor this is my invention
24387,what
24388,digging a black hole on my doorstep
24389,so it was you that rescued my ship
24390,no why should i have seen her
24391,oh
24392,what is it
24393,after him you fools you dolts
24394,mercy lord nimon i brought you the tribute
24395,its no use it had no effect on the nimon
24396,its a dead end
24397,what about the way youve just come
24398,shush
24399,there must be some sort of
24400,what
24401,if the nimon comes along were trapped
24402,whats that for burning the bodies
24403,sustenance
24404,whats the furnace for then
24405,fuelled by your crystals
24406,theyre with the nimon
24407,oh surely not
24408,that must lead deeper into the complex
24409,well never get out that way
24410,what idea
24411,weve got to find the others
24412,doctor look at this
24413,its quite a powerhouse isnt it
24414,well it seems to be some form of transmitter
24415,but transmitting what
24416,of course that would account for the hymetusite in the nuclear furnace its immensely powerful an amazing bit of engineering
24417,only the nimon knows that
24418,right what do we do if he comes
24419,dont worry doctor if the nimon comes seth will deal with him  seth
24420,what
24421,what
24422,of course
24423,they keep switching
24424,but why we still dont know what its transmitting or where to
24425,k9
24426,but will he be able to find us
24427,ive never seen anything quite like this before
24428,no transmat pad
24429,hmm it seems to be pumping out energy over vast distances
24430,our black hole
24431,from here
24432,but why what good is a black hole to anyone
24433,with an exit somewhere else
24434,where
24435,ah well people often dont know what youre talking about
24436,doctor theres something coming
24437,its too late its coming
24438,doctor dont
24439,well what is he doing
24440,sorak you know i have nothing to fear in the name of the second skonnon empire
24441,its a space capsule
24442,i dont understand theres no engines
24443,the energy beam the black hole
24444,and that beam providing the motive power
24445,the nimons have found a way of leaping across the universe as far as they want instantaneously
24446,i thought there was only one nimon
24447,seth whats happening
24448,invasion
24449,skonnos
24450,but its already inhabited
24451,then how many more are coming
24452,to make all this worthwhile there must be thousands
24453,what two at a time
24454,how
24455,on guard again
24456,yes
24457,everything
24458,doctor
24459,oh i wish you wouldnt do that
24460,really

24464,where is she
24465,what are you going to do
24466,you doctor
24467,leave that alone
24468,you meddling fool you shall die
24469,is he dead
24470,doctor i doctor doctor where are you  nimon 3
24471,is there anything i can do
24472,will it help
24473,will it work
24474,what
24475,oh doctor look  soldeed
24476,seth seth
24477,i will try
24478,go go and warn skonnos and the rest of the universe
24479,stand aside  nimon 2
24480,whats going on
24481,the invasions started from crinoth doctor switch it back
24482,yes
24483,doctor
24484,what is it
24485,oh
24486,what about teka
24487,the room with the nuclear furnace
24488,right come on seth
24489,but theyre dead
24490,i knew youd save me seth i knew it
24491,doctor how are we going to get out of this place if no one else has ever managed it before
24492,pursue them
24493,we dont know      k9
24494,nothing
24495,were trapped
24496,come on doctor hurry up
24497,get away everybody get away
24498,immobilised again
24499,you said that once before remember
24500,and how may times have you been right
24501,what do you think skonnos will be like with sorak in charge
24502,doctor
24503,look
24504,and the end of the nimons
24505,i hope seth and teka and the others get back to aneth safely
24506,look there they are
24507,poor old seth
24508,i suppose thats how legends are made
24509,what are you talking about
24510,thank you doctor
24511,yes well ill bring these back as soon as i can
24512,who
24513,newton of course
24514,for every action there is a equal and opposite reaction
24515,so newton invented punting
24516,isnt it wonderful how something so primitive can be so
24517,no simple you just push in one direction and the boat goes in the other oh i do love the spring all the leaves the colours
24518,i thought that you said we were coming here for may week
24519,im confused
24520,oh i do love the autumn all the leaves the colours
24521,the pole
24522,how
24523,did you just heard voices

24525,i am an historian
24526,good afternoon doctor
24527,why yes of course sir an honorary degree in 1960
24528,thats my job sir
24529,professor chronotis sir he returned to his room a few minutes ago
24530,because thats who you asked for when you were here in 1964 1960 and 1955 sir
24531,were you sir
24532,come along doctor

26888,just something would be a help
26889,well thats not what you said when we first arrived
26890,right place wrong time
26891,well you know how dangerous it is bypassing the randomiser
26892,we should be safe here i shouldnt think even he fancies freezing to death on brighton beach
26893,i certainly have
26894,k9s given me a complete list of recreation facilities in this galaxy
26895,i like the sound of argolis
26896,over the years visitors have been interested in the tricks it is possible to play with these solid images so by way of a preface to the scientific analysis that follows let me demonstrate some of the more spectacular possibilities
26897,why has it got to be
26898,what if i told you this part of the galaxy doesnt discover unreal transfer until 2386
26899,as you know tachyons travel faster than light
26900,and this matching tachyon field creates a temporary reduplication of any physical object are there any questions
26901,especially the duration problem
26902,as i demonstrated earlier myself visitor loman thinks the demonstration might have been an edited recording perhaps youd care to try for yourself mister loman
26903,no need to panic ladies and gentlemen
26904,who are you
26905,my mothers most anxious to meet this gentleman
26906,his mothers most anxious to meet you
26907,madam chairman wishes to see you sir
26908,must be his mother
26909,no wonder theres so much secrecy about these experiments
26910,stop stop who are you
26911,but this isnt hardin
26912,how did you get here all our visitors have identification
26913,and now they have seen the earth experiments
26914,that experiment was a fake you know that
26915,can i help you
26916,attention warn all security guides to be on the alert for two unidentified visitors description    mena
26917,have they
26918,and you noticed the necklace of course
26919,the clothes were the same but the necklace was different
26920,of course
26921,there must be something we can do
26922,of course
26923,earth scientist hardin to the boardroom earth scientist hardin to the boardroom
26924,how did you get out
26925,but there isnt one
26926,ah where do you come from
26927,ive never heard of it
26928,wait have you ever experimented with time
26929,earth visitor hardin thinks that you might be able to help with his experiments
26930,gallifrey abandoned tachyonics when we developed warp matrix engineering
26931,you saw the time experiment
26932,we are a peaceful people but you are unidentified visitors our decision will depend on your conduct
26933,its beautiful
26934,but not the heavy metal dust it wont be habitable for three centuries
26935,twenty minutes
26936,the physical reason yes but the purpose is to promote understanding between life forms of all culture and genetic type there must be no more such wars
26937,interfibral malfunction a lines gone down so many faults accidents the death this morning
26938,the fibreoptic transmission system has a mean time between failure of two thousand years
26939,does she mean theyre sterile
26940,please dont worry this is quite normal
26941,but you look older
26942,soon madam chairman
26943,stay back
26944,theres a question of radiation hazard
26945,override failsafe override failsafe eliminate intruder eliminate intruder
26946,doctor
26947,this is your scarf isnt it doctor
26948,his scarf killed stimson
26949,the court is sitting doctor
26950,we argolins have a sacred reminder of the evil that dwells in violence the helmet of theron who led argolis into the war that wiped it out can you swear your innocence before the helmet of theron
26951,does that conclude the evidence
26952,im the judge here doctor
26953,these superstitions are not for us pangol
26954,according to our calculations the most itll do is knock off ten or twelve years
26955,i cant
26956,are you all right
26957,have you seen yourself
26958,i dont know hardware malfunction i dont understand
26959,romana will stay where she is work on your own hardin
26960,temporal asymmetry well have to get back to the generator your conditions unstable
26961,pangol
26962,mmm why two i wonder
26963,an alternative function there must be a second circuit in there doing something we know nothing about
26964,mister brock says you might be able to help by looking at the recreation generator
26965,these are mere toys my time experiments are the first glimpse of any real use for the recreation generator
26966,of course the argolins have nothing to show for their forty years work on tachyonics
26967,the generator
26968,creating things again
26969,the new argolis
26970,which was forty years ago but how old do you think i am mister brock
26971,yes it produced this rapid aging effect
26972,its not recreation its some sort of reduplication process going on in there
26973,no it cant be you or the doctor im the only one who can go in the generator while its unstable
26974,tachyon surge if there is i come out aged six hundred and fifty but if youre in there what we need is a diversion
26975,psst you come on
26976,its all right hes in here five hundred years the last time doctor lets see what youre like when youve aged two thousand
26977,its all right hes a friend he got me out of the generator before pangol started it up
26978,i dont know
26979,romana thank heavens youre safe
26980,whats he doing on argolis
26981,doctor what do you make of this
26982,is it something to do with the random field frame
26983,where to
26984,but can we trust him
26985,the doctor seize him
26986,now that i have your attention and this traitors voice synthesiser i must explain i am the foamasi government
26987,im glad this has ended so satisfactorily
26988,what the doctor means is
26989,i cant see any way round that can you doctor doctor
26990,now if we had a second random field frame
26991,not the randomiser
26992,the foamasi will return to the hive to witness the fulfillment of argolin destiny
26993,no no no no
26994,thank heavens at least youre solid enough
26995,please
26996,youre the last one
26997,what
26998,then youre real
26999,here i think i see the images must have been multiplied in a sort of fifo stack
27000,which would make you the original
27001,ive just remembered
27002,look
27003,its useless the doors wont open while its running
27004,the west lodge leader who impersonated brock must have tried to take off without us
27005,ah of course well lets continue this discussion in the boardroom
27006,doctor
27007,the randomiser
27008,well we cant just leave it here
27009,neither does the black guardian that is the point of the thing the black guardians a real threat
27010,job it was meant to be a holiday
27011,were in the prion planetary system wed better land
27012,theres a planet called tigella
27013,well theres one called zolfathura thats in the history books
27014,a great civilisation blown away to sand and ashes
27015,now all thats left is the screens
27016,the screens of zolfathura
27017,thats right
27018,when
27019,no no no please please can we just do one thing at a time
27020,exactly
27021,youll know when you see him this probably needs his delicacy of touch
27022,it was hardly his fault that someone neglected to seaproof him
27023,oh i hope hes going to be all right were going to need him on tigella
27024,the plants are lush aggressive vegetation
27025,it says in the history books that it was the lush aggressive vegetation that forced the tigellans to retreat beneath the surface you must have seen it last time you were there
27026,post repair test questions
27027,i want to know a lot more about all this
27028,im more worried about the power depletion at this rate hes going to need recharging every two hours
27029,tigella wont take long then
27030,what is the energy process baryon multiplication
27031,whos travels i must interrupt now where is he and when
27032,where
27033,magnetic tweezers
27034,thanks i think ive almost done it
27035,oh blast here we go again
27036,well now his probe circuits jammed
27037,all right weve tried everything else    k9
27038,becoming i was fully qualified when i arrived
27039,good boy k9
27040,oh blast here we go again
27041,well now his probe circuits jammed
27042,oh blast here we go again
27043,well now his probe circuits jammed
27044,all right weve tried everything else    k9
27045,the tardis appears to be functioning normally
27046,chronic hysteresis  i hope not if it is well be stuck here forever
27047,oh blast here we go again
27048,well now his probe circuits jammed
27049,what can we try now k9 is there any way out of a chronic hysteresis  k9
27050,what if we stop the time rotor
27051,im only trying to help
27052,oh blast here we go again
27053,well now his probe circuits jammed
27054,we cant get out of it weve tried everything
27055,what
27056,i should think so weve been through it enough times
27057,you mean go through the motions deliberately
27058,well you were over there
27059,over there
27060,oh blast here we go again
27061,now his probe circuits jammed
27062,phase cancellation weve done it
27063,so be it    doctor
27064,well if this is the city i can only assume were in some sort of park  k9
27065,where is the city then
27066,doctor
27067,ten thousand years
27068,nonsense k9 these leaves are burnt  k9
27069,what
27070,i didnt see you go out
27071,this is the second time youve been in here
27072,this is a control command this is a control command    lexa
27073,there he is take him
27074,where is the dodecahedron
27075,doctor whats happened
27076,we
27077,baffled doctor
27078,youd better come with us
27079,about two hours but hurry
27080,what did you do
27081,cant you see youve paralysed our city
27082,answer me what happened to the dodecahedron
27083,doctor
27084,whatever reasons you had for doing this the fact remains that without the dodecahedrons energy in two hours time this city will be dead
27085,and he wont even admit to taking the deon oath and entering the power room
27086,im going to seal off the city well search every area
27087,what do you mean
27088,youll have to do better than that doctor
27089,i think youre a fraud and a liar
27090,oh why
27091,and the third possibility
27092,one moment i want to trust you doctor but how can i doubt my own eyes
27093,no lexa very well doctor this time we will go to the power room together
27094,deons what are they up to
27095,well yes we always presumed it would be heavy
27096,faith dwells in the deeds zastor not in the words  deedrix
27097,ultimately lethal
27098,no doctor
27099,you are going to bring back the dodecahedron
27100,no doctor not in the ordinary way
27101,gaztaks is this true
27102,i saw him holding the dodecahedron doctor
27103,he talked about taking it back to the dead planet
27104,theres nothing there except sand
27105,and the screens
27106,the screens of zolfathura
27107,now to see it work
27108,romana
27109,she saved my life
27110,its lighting up the whole sky
27111,the gaztaks kill on sight
27112,you can impersonate meglos
27113,there can be no room for error ill just recheck the screen alignments
27114,no
27115,that was quick
27116,start the countdown
27117,i thought it was already programmed
27118,to annihilate tigella
27119,you said it focused the beams
27120,i think we should come along k9
27121,so its now just the countdown and activation
27122,sixty fifty nine
27123,shouldnt you be doing something
27124,what are they playing at
27125,i knew he wouldnt get away with it theyve got the doctor
27126,ten thousand years cretins morons halfwits
27127,they probably wont even hit tigella
27128,your calculations
27129,three metres by five metres and i could have had the galaxy the universe
27130,what
27131,why
27132,its beyond your comprehension
27133,out of my way
27134,was that meglos
27135,he must have modulated himself on a particular wavelength of light
27136,but that would make him virtually indestructible
27137,atomised
27138,no
27139,twenty nine twenty eight twenty seven twenty six    brotadac
27140,well weve made a beginning doctor
27141,gallifrey
27142,they want us back immediately
27143,maybe i will ill be in trouble back home
27144,i told the wife id be in from work in twenty minutes
27145,oh good  ltback to the episode listing
27146,youve made up your mind then
27147,the time lords want me back
27148,doctor i dont want to spend the rest of my life on gallifrey after all this
27149,you did once
27150,well theres nothing more to discuss then we have to go
27151,doctor whats happening
27152,well what happened k9  k9
27153,doctor
27154,weve materialised
27155,i suppose so
27156,sorry
27157,yes there seems to be a trace just a trace
27158,ten zero eleven zero zero by zero two k9 is right
27159,what are we going to do
27160,doctor the last time you tried that
27161,what was that noise
27162,i thought i heard a noise
27163,ive got to warn them
27164,mistfall
27165,my brother says its a myth the outlers all think the deciders are lying but ive seen it
27166,again
27167,that blue box i saw i saw a blue box
27168,well it was old and there was a door no there were two doors and they opened inwards and there was something funny about them handles werent on the same level
27169,where are you going
27170,yes but we still havent worked out whats wrong with this
27171,oh the console the scanner
27172,of course it does real space doesnt have  negative coordinates doctor that disruption we came through
27173,its a very nasty thought that would mean that were out of real space altogether     k9
27174,adric       k9
27175,well i cant remember where it is
27176,something has picked up the tardis
27177,get back
27178,what do you mean its who are you
27179,but how did you you unsealed the entrance
27180,weve waited a long time to examine one of these take it to dexeter
27181,i am login
27182,you witnessed the death of decider draith
27183,decider draith
27184,they seem to resent our presence as aliens
27185,how do you know this about decider draith if you did not witness the event
27186,you went to the marsh
27187,but the mists how could you breathe
27188,the specimen is useless nothing no aggression none of the characteristic traits useless
27189,im speaking scientifically
27190,youre a scientist
27191,i dont know i think were travelling
27192,a little anaesthetic im trying to research the psychodynamics of these creatures their motivation to attack us is immensely powerful
27193,its well documented of course ive never seen one before but its in the manuals
27194,they have the same basic brain type
27195,a scientist is responsible to the community doctor each of us has his task to perform
27196,what do you mean
27197,preparing for the embarkation of course
27198,yes all our endeavours are directed toward the return to terradon
27199,take a look at that tissue sample remarkable isnt it doctor the organisation of the cell structure
27200,there are anomalies unaccounted for by the deciders
27201,its too late for that doctor
27202,what
27203,its impossible to leave the starliner the doors are sealed
27204,what did you have in mind doctor
27205,your entry was more than a hypothesis perhaps our security system is not all the manuals claim
27206,without the store of knowledge in the great book room we would not have survived doctor please show me how you gained access
27207,how should i know romana set the coordinates not me       man
27208,any method of entering the starliner is of grave concern
27209,i know nothing about these matters myself but the manuals are thorough in their requirements
27210,oh generations doctor weve no illusions about that
27211,well theres always something that needs to be perfected a little patience goes a long way
27212,you spoke of some vehicle you travel in
27213,i can help you to find it
27214,i have a daughter
27215,help me find my daughter ill help you find your ship
27216,good heavens what is it
27217,father
27218,keara youre safe
27219,shes not here
27220,keara youre alive
27221,therell have to be an inquiry but at least youre alive
27222,yes
27223,yes
27224,theres a dead spider
27225,we will return before then
27226,no it wasnt in the cave
27227,how long will it last
27228,there is no punishment     doctor
27229,the anaesthetic has worn off and the creature is now fully sentient    dexeter  im about to begin a surgical examination of its brain
27230,i repeat i am beginning surgery
27231,take away the bodies
27232,the marsh creatures are mindless brutes animals
27233,one might argue that dexeter was overzealous
27234,certainly we are though of course nefred is er is now first decider
27235,for the community yes
27236,secret
27237,no doctor thats too harsh the preparations are necessary
27238,yes but it must be made ready first
27239,is that true
27240,you understand a great deal doctor
27241,but not everything
27242,though there is one thing we cant do doctor
27243,one secret our ancestors kept for themselves
27244,nobody knows how to pilot this ship
27245,the spiders only appear at mistfall no ones ever analysed one before
27246,yes but the secret is only known to the deciders
27247,i do but the information is privileged
27248,doctor every fifty years or so another planet takes alzarius away from its sun the cooling process its inevitable
27249,so
27250,doctor
27251,doctor its romana
27252,shes gone
27253,marshmen
27254,whats that
27255,image translator
27256,its broken
27257,thats what the decider said
27258,in the marsh
27259,tell dexeter weve come full circle
27260,that was hours ago
27261,old people take a bit longer of course sometimes a whole day
27262,settles what
27263,marsh men weve got to go back for tylos
27264,but we must
27265,well login youre a decider now what are we to do
27266,doctor wheres tylos
27267,it is what you wanted isnt it for the tardis
27268,sometimes
27269,espace
27270,and heres the first slide of batch three
27271,its ready doctor
27272,hes already told us what to do garif we must find the doctor
27273,doctor look out
27274,suppose it doesnt work
27275,forty generations
27276,why not
27277,what are you doing
27278,from spiders to marsh creatures
27279,since the starliner crashed
27280,can i see how can you tell all that from the marsh creature cells
27281,dexeter
27282,the same cells
27283,varsh is trapped
27284,varsh
27285,as much as you want we have an electrolytic power system
27286,yes
27287,oxygen supply to all areas oxygen supply to all areas oxygen supply to all areas
27288,what
27289,theyll learn to breath the air
27290,they might break into the ship and wipe out the crew
27291,they could learn to read
27292,its horrible
27293,how can you compare us to those those things
27294,so the first marsh men came to resemble the original crew of the starliner
27295,terradonians we are not terradonians
27296,we must do what nefred said doctor you must fly the starliner you must fly us out of here
27297,the system files doctor
27298,the pages referring to takeoff were damaged in the crash
27299,ground hold disengage
27300,then its just ignition
27301,the manual is readable from there on
27302,doctor come back
27303,but you will agree it does require some thought
27304,you a decider
27305,doctor what did happen while i was unconscious
27306,hmm adrics left us a present
27307,it works
27308,negative coordinates
27309,exospace
27310,doctor look the starliner is taking off
27311,its finished go
27312,really
27313,we are
27314,but we are personally trapped
27315,so we are trapped
27316,we are marooned in the exospace time continuum
27317,it might be
27318,supposing there arent any other planets here
27319,you are incredible
27320,how did you know
27321,sounds as if its come and gone  k9
27322,why here
27323,k9 said high technology
27324,shush
27325,you mustnt judge by appearances doctor
27326,news when is there ever news
27327,it isnt possible theres nowhere else how can you be here
27328,my lord
27329,my lord how may i serve you
27330,your lords command
27331,scientists
27332,if my lord will excuse me my duties
27333,strangers
27334,there is only the village and the tower nowhere else
27335,why do you ask what everyone must know are you sent to test me i am ivo head man of this village like my father before me and his father before him the lords know im loyal
27336,they protect us from the wasting
27337,come on doctor this is silly
27338,forever
27339,gotcha
27340,there isnt another village
27341,whats that noise
27342,doctor
27343,say something
27344,if they are still on this planet my servants will find them
27345,doctor whats a technocotheca
27346,doctor thats a word ive seen in the old records its a title used by scientists are you a scientist doctor like me
27347,he was asking about scientists in the centre all right its time for some answers
27348,itll do for a start
27349,but it will change when we overthrow the lords
27350,you know about the wasting
27351,the wasting
27352,the wasting
27353,some of us could still read its forbidden but the knowledge was passed on in secret
27354,i see youve got a lot to rebel against
27355,nonsense its just a standard earthtype databank ill have to crack the entry code but earth type
27356,ships manifest and cargo flight plan from earth so it is earth crew of exploration vessel hydrax en route from earth destination beta two in the perugellis sector
27357,hmm they must have gone through a cve as well ships officers captain miles sharkey navigational officer lauren macmillan science officer anthony oconnor identification pictures follow its still legible
27358,those faces
27359,i was a tower guard before i joined kalmar i saw them every day
27360,but as you say it cant be
27361,the three who rule the king his queen
27362,and aukon the councillor no im sorry i see their faces everywhere if you knew these people doctor
27363,no while i lead i will make the decision they are free to go
27364,its getting dark suddenly
27365,doesnt feel natural theres that noise again
27366,do you mind if we get a move on
27367,stop wait here do not move
27368,what windows
27369,no i wouldnt
27370,oh doctor
27371,greetings
27372,we know everything here
27373,what we do not know is why you are here
27374,as we will enjoy having you
27375,we struggle to retain some remnants of civilisation on an isolated primitive planet like this it isnt easy
27376,the peasants are simple folk richer fare would only distress them
27377,there are many dangers on this planet
27378,ow
27379,bad luck mostly
27380,a universe offcourse
27381,we can never return home our technology is lost
27382,wealth power dominion over this world and over many others
27383,wrong
27384,what is is
27385,oh yes in terms of applied socioenergetics its losing its grip on level two development
27386,a society that evolve backwards must be subject to some even more powerful force restraining it
27387,how very mysterious
27388,in any society there is bound to be a division the rulers and the ruled
27389,no id say a sociopathetic abscess
27390,be careful doctor we have acquired great powers
27391,there must be rulers a ship of state must have a pilot
27392,no
27393,a metaphor
27394,hydrax
27395,i said be silent
27396,we shall resume this later if you need anything there are guards outside the door many guards
27397,captain miles sharkey navigation officer lauren macmillan science officer anthony oconnor
27398,this is no time for fairy tales
27399,you mean the hard sounds softening bs becoming vs and so on
27400,camilla aukon and zargo wait a minute sharkey zharkey zarkey zar zargo the same name passed down through generations
27401,camilla
27402,aukon the descendants of the original ships officers
27403,you mean this is the hydrax the explorer ship
27404,mmm
27405,ahem doctor
27406,doctor
27407,we must be right inside the turret
27408,i wonder why they didnt rip out all these instruments too
27409,so it could still fly
27410,could we possibly jet our way out
27411,it proved your point that this is a spaceship
27412,sounds like a faint engine noise
27413,what is it
27414,of what
27415,now where are we
27416,i can hear that sound again
27417,what are we looking for

27430,what is it
27431,really
27432,or please say something
27433,no
27434,you are in the resting place
27435,the resting place
27436,i am aukon welcome to my domain
27437,youre a fool to mock doctor there is power here such as you have never dreamed of can you not feel it
27438,power doctor it is the only reality why fight it when you could share it
27439,when i sent my winged messengers to hunt you down i sensed the power of your mind we seek such minds for our great purpose
27440,at the time of arising we servants will swarm you could be one of us
27441,that is the secret of him who brought us here
27442,we were summoned the whole ship to be his servants
27443,he was oconnor
27444,suppose we pretended to cooperate till we get the data on espace
27445,consider well doctor wont you join us like your other companion
27446,adric
27447,you will all serve the great one doctor one way or another if you do not join us you will feed him with your blood
27448,what is that
27449,stop doctor by the power that is mine i command you
27450,come doctor
27451,why am i still afraid
27452,did he lead a very sheltered life
27453,no
27454,vampires
27455,what did they do doctor
27456,oh
27457,one single vampire could suck the life out of an entire planet
27458,rubbish
27459,so they were all destroyed
27460,and
27461,when was all this supposed to have happened
27462,the legend
27463,i once worked in the bureau of ancient records for a time
27464,oh nothing its just that i once came across a reference to something called the record of rassilon in one of the old data books
27465,and it was an emergency instruction a copy of the book was to be installed in certain time vehicles
27466,oh i dont know i forget
27467,type forty i think
27468,is it oh
27469,quick the corridor wheres the doctor are you all right
27470,you and your heroes can watch it on the scanner kalmar but remember this when theyve finished with us theyll come for you
27471,right
27472,weve forgotten about adric hes still a prisoner somewhere weve got to find him
27473,well there is an inner sanctum its where nobodys allowed but the three
27474,of course doctor
27475,no you take the tardis ill take the inner sanctum
27476,certainly    k9
27477,lets hope they dont wake up ive heard that when they wake they wake hungry
27478,im just wondering if weve found him in time
27479,the girl is a time lord one of the ancient enemies of the great one she is to be held for sacrifice at the time of arising
27480,the doctor was a scientist like all the rest he vanished in the tower
27481,at midnight our servitude will end and our glory begin but the proper rituals must be carried out or the great one will be displeased zargo camilla you will initiate the boy after i have sacrificed the girl
27482,what
27483,we must join forces with ivo and attack the tower tarak was right
27484,where is tarak now we dare not attack the tower until we are ready
27485,do you really expect us to believe that some great creature sleeps beneath the tower and is about to awake and destroy us
27486,i dont know
27487,the scanner
27488,the console you got working for us i discovered another facility
27489,it should reach the tower
27490,theres the tower
27491,what is it
27492,it is time
27493,but what about aukon
27494,but what about the guards
27495,you said your people killed thousands of them
27496,well
27497,if we sharpened a tree trunk
27498,a catapult
27499,yes
27500,yes
27501,good
27502,doctor
27503,stay calm doctor
27504,we will not take orders from that thing
27505,never
27506,by the time the tower falls the great one will have arisen we shall be invincible
27507,i tried to help him
27508,seize him
27509,come o servants of the great one come drink the blood of the sacrifice
27510,no
27511,you sent the scout ship on a little trip
27512,he comes the great one comes
27513,no
27514,no no
27515,what did you do
27516,but what about the lords zargo and the others
27517,doctor
27518,as once scientist to another congratulations
27519,there is one thing doctor
27520,i feel i really must apologise for the things i said about k9
27521,well done dog  k9
27522,well do our best doctor
27523,doctor
27524,if we can get the main ship working
27525,is there any way out of this espace perhaps one day we can get back to earth
27526,thank you doctor
27527,one more go
27528,its not me its a time rift she wont respond to the coordinates
27529,i have been friendly
27530,there
27531,come on doctor weve got to do something
27532,what do you mean
27533,what drifting
27534,go on then admit it you dont know what your doing
27535,its no better than tossing a coin
27536,superstition
27537,the holistic view
27538,what do you want me to say        rorvik
27539,dawn
27540,according to your theory we just press any button and hope for the best
27541,but not that button
27542,in full flight
27543,have you got a death wish
27544,you know i dont want to get back to gallifrey
27545,what about adric
27546,well if we get out of espace well be taking him away from his own universe
27547,do we have that right
27548,im fine
27549,i think so
27550,hes out of phase
27551,can he see us
27552,i am biroc others follow
27553,the shadow of my past and of your future
27554,and of our future
27555,theyre all locked off at zero
27556,maybe it was the time winds
27557,doctor
27558,zero coordinates
27559,good job youre not running this outfit she must be a time sensitive like the tharils
27560,bulk freighter full of questions arent you
27561,expedition gear were going out to it move time sensitive huh dont think ive finished with you yet
27562,we are gundan we exist to kill slaves made the gundan to kill the brutes who rule
27563,the gundan were sent where no slaves could go we faced the time winds and we lived they had only the gateway to flee for safety
27564,gateway gateway gateway
27565,you switch it off
27566,there were always slaves from the beginning of time the masters descended out of the air riding the winds and took men as their prize growing powerful on their stolen labours and their looted skills
27567,the masters created an empire drained the life of the ordinary world
27568,they came from the gateway
27569,there are three physical gateways and the three are one
27570,the whole of this domain the ancient arch the mirrors
27571,all the gateways are one
27572,something were all interested in i think
27573,lets have the rest of the recital
27574,prompt him go on more
27575,for all their skills the slaves could not approach the gateway in their own persons but once they learned its secret we were built the gundan robots to wage war on them
27576,yes yes
27577,there he is look        k9
27578,the time winds touched your hand it will be healing now
27579,no no brute force this needs some thought    k9
27580,when the time is right    k9
27581,you have in your pocket a memory wafer you took from the gundan
27582,k9 will be restored in the same way
27583,that will happen but your hand is living matter and will remain healed when you return to the other side of the mirror
27584,where he must stay
27585,you are where you were
27586,for the tharils and those with us it opens onto a whole universe
27587,theres our bad luck
27588,right lunch up lads
27589,the universe is our garden
27590,at the height of our empire before the tharils became the slaves of men
27591,we use our power for those who travel on the time winds the vastness of space is no obstacle everything is ours
27592,theyre only people
27593,the weak enslave themselves doctor you and i know that
27594,we must have jumped back over the striations
27595,you seem to come and go around here with a great deal of freedom
27596,i negotiate from strength
27597,so youve mended your warp motors then found a new navigator
27598,except that you know the way out
27599,that way
27600,no no
27601,a culdesac
27602,all right why not its his last meal
27603,i dont believe it
27604,oh shut him up
27605,its the memory wafers doctor
27606,hes going a bit funny  k9
27607,time to play with your toys later doctor
27608,you cant get worse than the back of beyond
27609,at least hear him out whats the hurry
27610,so its starting
27611,but might collapse completely at any minute
27612,it might the hull is made of dwarf star alloy
27613,dwarf star alloy
27614,theyre slavers
27615,and its very expensive
27616,poor creatures each ones worth a kings ransom doctor you seem to understand business even less than you understand science this wild theory about contraction
27617,like between the ship and here
27618,shut up hes playing for time
27619,hes right about one thing the trip between here and the ship each time weve done it it has been shorter
27620,oh gobbledygook we can deal with this in very short order get us through times run out for you doctor
27621,doctor youve seen our past youve seen our present you were right we abused our power but judge whether weve not suffered enough
27622,the time of our enslavement is over we will be free
27623,do nothing
27624,it is done
27625,you poisonous runt who is this boy
27626,youll never get away with this doctor
27627,we found it
27628,what are the others
27629,whats happening
27630,whats he doing he cant take off with his warp motors in that state
27631,what
27632,hes mad the back blast backlash will bounce back and destroy everything
27633,its bound to accelerate the collapse of space around here
27634,but surely that would flip you back into nspace if you dematerialised at the right moment
27635,we cannot even think of that with those slaves on board weve got to do something
27636,wait a minute there is that damaged area
27637,of course
27638,by the warp motors
27639,the main cable insulation is exposed we might be able to short out his power
27640,i am not letting you go alone
27641,it is long past time but how do you think youre going to find the cable
27642,adric and i have seen it
27643,you are not its long past time you learnt to obey orders now stay here and if we are not back for whatever reason in thirteen and a half minutes i want you to dematerialise do you understand
27644,its a matter of complete indifference to me
27645,is this what youre looking for doctor
27646,so you say doctor i say its the only way out of here
27647,theyve got to break everything breaks eventually
27648,i know ive done it
27649,nothing
27650,and for you too do nothing
27651,of course doctor dont you see
27652,just a minute argh
27653,im not coming with you
27654,no more orders doctor goodbye
27655,goodbye doctor
27656,ill take care of him
27657,and you and i k9 are going to biroc free them thats something weve got to do dont you think  k9
27658,its gone nothing there
27659,how can nothing be something
27660,back in your own universe
27661,can you be sure
27662,no
27663,will romana be all right
27664,so this in nspace
27665,all those stars
27666,do you know them all
27667,how can you tell which is which
27668,i dont see what the law of probabilitys got to do with it
27669,yes
27670,yes
27671,no no im just saying that a lot of the time you dont really make sense
27672,then where are we
27673,thats what it says here
27674,traken isnt it
27675,by
27676,well that makes a change
27677,well you wont have to were going there anyway
27678,you set the controls for it
27679,no no you must have
27680,weve gone into orbit round one of the planets
27681,thought what
27682,whats happening
27683,well you should know
27684,well you are a time lord arent you
27685,how do you do
27686,well guessed doctor the reports i hear of your intelligence are true i see
27687,well you could have told me
27688,listen closely doctor as you see the passing ages have taken toll of me
27689,but unlike you my time of dissolution is near and the power entrusted to me is ebbing away
27690,i have all the minds of the union to draw on i am only the organising principle it is on that count i ask you to come to traken
27691,think carefully before you agree there is great danger in this for you and your young friend
27692,universal harmony you said
27693,the doctor does not exaggerate since the time of the keepers our union has been the most harmonious the universe has ever seen does the boy not know of this
27694,how vain one can still be i thought the whole universe knew the history of our little empire
27695,oh forgive me may i borrow it for a moment
27696,they name such creatures melkur
27697,melkur literally a fly caught by honey the fosters know theres nothing to fear from these visitations
27698,its baleful influence will not extend beyond the grove and even here it will only produce a few weeds like others before it the creature will calcify and pass harmlessly into the soil but the demise of any living thing is painful to us    kassia
27699,now it begins my certain knowledge of the coming dissolution no keeper lasts forever and the period of transition is always difficult but i sensed more than that even as i came to name tremas as my successor
27700,allpervading evil and somehow nurtured in those three good people standing before me to receive the blessing of the keeper doctor my time is close i need your help
27701,that goes for me too
27702,well thats a funny way of going about things
27703,i dont know but i do hope we know what were doing
27704,whatevers that
27705,a gazetteer
27706,i suppose it helps keeping a time log
27707,what am i looking for
27708,universal harmony
27709,if i could understand it
27710,well look i read about something thats just happened
27711,the next page says it didnt happen at all
27712,over the page says it did happen but many years ago
27713,as for your handwriting
27714,its marvellous
27715,it looks almost alive
27716,ive got the nasty feeling its looking at us
27717,the keeper knows our situation hell speak when the time is right
27718,so who are you
27719,hes called the doctor and im adric
27720,invited
27721,who asked you here
27722,youve had contact with the keeper
27723,the keeper said one would come amongst us to help trakens could you be this one doctor
27724,you say doctor that you arrived here in some kind of craft
27725,and landed in the grove
27726,then your craft should still be there
27727,it seems they have indeed been lying to us
27728,bring the strangers forward
27729,evil the sanctum is invaded
27730,consuls we are invaded evil infinite evil
27731,fosters do your duty
27732,execute them this evil must be stamped out
27733,wait do i understand you to imply that one of us here used force against the keeper
27734,my wife is not well
27735,since she was a child
27736,perhaps but i would like this clear are you asking us to believe that some kind of psychic power has been used
27737,are you a scientist doctor
27738,you understand these things
27739,in the courtyard
27740,we have no right to question him on that point very well we place you both under the protection of consul tremas you realise the consequences
27741,should you infringe the law here in any way then his life too is forfeit
27742,but you must stay with him
27743,theres little of the night left doctor itll soon be dawn
27744,what doctor
27745,how do you know
27746,no doctor
27747,yes melkur
27748,what do you have in mind
27749,hello
27750,how do you feel
27751,there was nothing like that there
27752,very well ill take you there myself but just you doctor adric will stay here
27753,proctor neman
27754,there are rumours that the melkur has been redeemed and will bring these disasters to an end
27755,it would perhaps be better if the consul were not to visit the grove it might be seen as confirmation of the rumour
27756,the mans too fond of money to be trusted
27757,there is another way to the grove the service vault beneath the keepers chamber
27758,there is much that you do not understand kassia      kassia
27759,kassia
27760,she must have come from the grove
27761,yes its functions have expanded steadily over the years
27762,yes the thought has occurred to me come the grove is this way      doctor
27763,well
27764,would a binary induction system serve the purpose
27765,doctor
27766,doctor doctor i must speak to you
27767,no
27768,i thought they might be from some sort of a tardis i dont know what the doctor thinks
27769,keeper of traken the consuls integrity is in doubt i therefore claim rapport with the source so that you may make your judgement
27770,doctor
27771,seron and now you tremas is nothing sacred any more fosters take them
27772,but we cant get out there are fosters at the other door to the grove
27773,will it work
27774,doctor recovering the tardis wont help you
27775,turn off your instrument
27776,dont look not my eyes
27777,but later
27778,its the penal wing doctor we havent had much use for these cells for some time now
27779,can you open it
27780,whats the matter
27781,not until the work is done kassia
27782,not much doctor serons murder proves the keepers power is at an end his death cant be far off
27783,how could he doctor the bioelectronics only permit a traken to succeed to the keepership
27784,i know what i am doing now the key to the cell please down there
27785,i suspect kassias bribed them she darent risk losing us now
27786,doctor
27787,follow me doctor
27788,the ion bonder i stepped up the ion rate theyll sleep for quite a bit yet
27789,where to doctor
27790,and the main gates guarded all the time
27791,yes yes
27792,up against the wall
27793,doctor the ion bonder
27794,thats enough kill them
27795,not if theyve already searched there
27796,time presses consul the power of the keeper is almost ours only the doctor can destroy all that we have planned he must be found must you hear
27797,huh
27798,what plans in particular
27799,yes in the atmosphere safe the secrecy of the source manipulator is a sacred trust
27800,but i swore an oath doctor
27801,i cant doctor
27802,the original design of the source manipulator the means that gave power to our keepers
27803,same as before neman the death of the prisoners
27804,its a small price to pay for harmony throughout the union doctor thousands of years of peace and prosperity for all our people
27805,that could be the crucial circuit
27806,what are you thinking doctor
27807,disaster
27808,you arent serious are you
27809,no movement nothing
27810,yes consul its happening at last foster find consul kassia bring her here immediately tell her tell her the keeper is dying
27811,its not like kassia to give up so easily i dont like it
27812,thats the silliest thing you ever said
27813,then let her hurry time runs out
27814,wait
27815,listen
27816,enough consul there is nothing to be said as far as you are concerned our instructions are clear
27817,by order of the keeper nominate you are all sentenced to death
27818,the keeper doctor the keepers dying
27819,doctor so you survive after all
27820,may you bring peace and blessing for all your time keeper
27821,fosters these traitors have no business here
27822,do your duty katura complete transition
27823,we warned you consuls
27824,who are you
27825,this is no keeper of traken
27826,consul luvic you may now summon proctor neman
27827,there is no compulsion it is your keeper who asks do it to serve him
27828,apparently you havent doctor consuls this man is known to me as is his ambition
27829,he speaks the truth do as the keeper says luvic
27830,yes consul that is why it happened as you saw it happen the old keeper foresaw this and kassia gave her life so that i should serve you
27831,you are confined to consul tremas quarters until further notice
27832,we can destroy melkur nyssa but only by completely destroying the source
27833,its normal doctor the reaction when a new keeper succeeds the effort weakens him his power comes and goes at first
27834,yes stalling opposition until his powers secure
27835,his powers increasing by the minute the full reaction process is a matter of hours no what am i thinking of we still need all five rings
27836,a control panel at the base of the chamber activated by consular rings
27837,er ah gamma mode encryption
27838,oh you couldnt derive it from one ring the computation would take thousands of years
27839,the keeper orders it that is enough do as i say
27840,i have told him and now i am going to tell you
27841,only a beginning doctor persuade your friend to cooperate
27842,correct doctor
27843,now doctor we are safe the source is secure
27844,part of the problem solved doctor
27845,halt or ill fire no one may leave the residential quarter
27846,cant say but next time we see the melkur the reaction is almost certain to be over
27847,you know another way to destroy melkur
27848,yes
27849,did you key the whole number in
27850,did you key the whole number in
27851,you nearly had the sanction programmes running a matter of moments
27852,yes tremas you will build machines to my design of course your colleagues will mobilise the people and i shall lead them to worlds without number to conquest
27853,and along the way many old scores will be settled doctor
27854,you still do not know me doctor but none of this will matter when i control the deeper mysteries of time
27855,but its going to blow any minute
27856,welcome to my new ship
27857,you will find immobility endurable doctor i speak from experience
27858,that would be irrational to waste all that acquired knowledge of the centuries you spoke of my library doctor i intend that you should become a part of it your mind i shall deposit there your body i am now nearing the end of my twelfth regeneration
27859,its useless father you cant stop it
27860,the source the source is failing
27861,what happened
27862,were all lucky doctor
27863,to have met you
27864,goodbye
27865,why couldnt i start it
27866,then why dont you
27867,well you did work out the code for the source manipulator
27868,but it did work
27869,doctor
27870,what doctor
27871,well no
27872,the cloister bell
27873,whats that
27874,but the tardis doesnt have battle stations
27875,a tighter ship
27876,entropy increases
27877,but it will get us to gallifrey wont it
27878,yes
27879,that is where were going isnt it
27880,the time lords wont approve
27881,so we dont get to go to gallifrey
27882,earths the planet with all the oceans isnt it
27883,wet
27884,tardises
27885,but weve got communications devices
27886,a police box
27887,id like to see earth but why go all that way just to look at something that looks like the tardis
27888,whatever for
27889,ive never heard of that
27890,logopolis but i thought we were going to earth
27891,you mean were going to measure logopolis too
27892,what is it
27893,well what does it mean
27894,but it did ring is there a wild catastrophe
27895,well something must have made it ring
27896,i thought there was something funny about that steering but you wouldnt listen to me
27897,but mapped on to one of the interior continua
27898,so you can change it into anything you like
27899,and k9 too
27900,so the chameleon circuits stuck
27901,in totters yard
27902,i thought she was yours
27903,yes
27904,what do these numbers and letters mean
27905,oh how boring
27906,yes i suppose thats useful
27907,no no i mean being able to change like that
27908,its very distinctive
27909,why whos looking for us now youve disposed of the master
27910,wild catastrophe
27911,man the battle stations
27912,whats supposed to happen
27913,its not bad for the tardis
27914,arent we going out there to measure it
27915,its just like the tardis
27916,police telephone free for use of
27917,cars are all right i guess just more fun to have your own plane back home what kind of a maintenance schedule are you running here aunty vanessa this tyres flat too
27918,how much more of this is there
27919,but it cant have thirty seven dimensions you said it was an ordinary earth object
27920,why
27921,and thats block transfer computation
27922,really
27923,creating solid objects through pure mathematics
27924,so why do we have to go to logopolis if the theorys as simple as you say
27925,not with a computer
27926,oh
27927,is that another expression
27928,they speak it
27929,intone the computations
27930,why
27931,a gravity bubble
27932,is that dangerous
27933,i thought it might have something to do with the gravity bubble
27934,but this is the tardis
27935,it looks just like yours
27936,thats funny its very peculiar indeed
27937,it couldnt be an infinite regression could it
27938,no
27939,done it
27940,whats causing it
27941,what materialising round the police box just as we planned to do
27942,good morning this your vehicle
27943,the sports car
27944,well while youre trying to work that one out perhaps youd like to explain this
27945,i think youd better come along with us
27946,he sir
27947,no sir and i dont want to have to go into detail you want to think yourself lucky that i dont have to be the judge
27948,im not paid to have opinions sir im paid to do my duty
27949,i think youd just better come along to the station with us sir
27950,just to assist us in our enquiries
27951,you can do that back at the station
27952,thats a police box sir not for
27953,look sir if you want a formal arrest
27954,the box has gone
27955,battle stations
27956,come on now sir
27957,whats the matter
27958,the cloister bell
27959,whats that
27960,are you sure
27961,im sorry i just
27962,sorry
27963,were moving
27964,so that other tardis really has gone
27965,but arent you going to answer the cloister bell
27966,theres got to me some trick to this davis
27967,know what
27968,traken hows nyssa
27969,tremas
27970,the masters escaped from traken but why take nyssas father
27971,hes taken over tremas
27972,can a time lord do that
27973,he read your mind
27974,are we still going to logopolis
27975,so how do we flush him out
27976,yes
27977,and water sluices in and floods out the whole tardis
27978,folded back
27979,halted
27980,closed
27981,ended
27982,if you are
27983,yes
27984,this is too much
27985,touched bottom
27986,whos that
27987,yes
27988,perhaps we arent down very deep
27989,nearly got it right
27990,the master
27991,who was that doctor who was that
27992,where are we going
27993,what
27994,so that was the master
27995,i just guessed
27996,but i can help you well cant i
27997,what sort of something
27998,logopolis
27999,are we going to be staying long
28000,what
28001,look if youre going after nyssa im coming too
28002,im adric thats the doctor
28003,you can take me right back where you found me doctor whoever you are my aunts waiting in the car to take me to the airport
28004,youve seen her
28005,my dear doctor logopolis is honoured by your visit
28006,i demand to know whats
28007,wheres here
28008,welcome time has changed little for either of us doctor you continue to roam the universe while we persist in our simple existence on this planet
28009,occasionally our researches require what is sometimes called technology but for the most part our computations are enough
28010,you have recorded the dimensions we need as data
28011,why dont we proceed to business immediately
28012,i thought you said they didnt use computers
28013,may i have the dimensions
28014,whats he doing
28015,the code is being compiled
28016,block transfer computation is a complex discipline way beyond the capabilities of simple machines it requires all the subtleties of the living mind is that not so doctor
28017,when am i going to get an explanation for all this
28018,ill try
28019,this will restore your chameleon circuit doctor
28020,it is a perfectly logical copy
28021,i always thought you underestimated the possibilities of block transfer computation doctor you see structure is the essence of matter and the essence of structure is mathematics
28022,of course and supply the necessary raw energy
28023,that is true now shall we implement the solution to your little problem doctor
28024,whats a lighthouse
28025,i understand theyre trying to get intelligent life to respond
28026,my dear doctor of course
28027,you dont want them with you in the tardis
28028,the central register quickly there may still be time the honour of logopolis is at stake
28029,time to do what we dont even know if hes alive in there
28030,interfering with the working of logopolis the most dangerous crime in the universe
28031,im coming with you
28032,it will keep us in mind of one another remember to tell no one that youve seen me yet
28033,my dear doctor
28034,there is no need
28035,adric and nyssa went to look for the master
28036,the murder of innocent logopolitans
28037,earth people
28038,aunty vanessa
28039,nyssa
28040,doctor
28041,thats the man who brought me from traken
28042,but hes the man on the bridge
28043,you said to be prepared for the worst
28044,why are you prepared for the worst doctor
28045,please remain where you are i have it in my power to bring logopolis to a complete halt
28046,yes thats how they built a replica of the pharos project
28047,i cant hear anything
28048,logopolis has stopped
28049,father
28050,but his body remains useful without it i could not have conquered logopolis
28051,its nothing more than a blanket of silence
28052,you expect me to believe that
28053,causal nexus you insult my intelligence
28054,very well one of your young friends will eliminate the other
28055,ive never been persuaded by hyperbole doctor
28056,everything began to waste away when he interfered but why
28057,i will wring the truth out of it
28058,more power would simply speed the collapse
28059,certainly the universe long ago passed the point of total collapse
28060,the charged vacuum emboitments
28061,we are beyond recriminations now beyond everything
28062,the creature that killed my father
28063,an alliance with you doctor
28064,if we do cooperate therell be no question of you ever returning to gallifrey
28065,doctor what are you doing
28066,but doctor
28067,but how can it get here when theres no one in it
28068,it must be the man who brought be to logopolis
28069,look we want to help you
28070,together
28071,you do realise hes no chance of survival without our help
28072,hes trying to salvage the research teams work he must have gone to the central register yes
28073,have a nice trip
28074,youre assuming a lot arent you doctor
28075,logopolitan maths on a computer
28076,this is the programme we were developing to take the burden from our own shoulders a series of data statements to keep the charged vacuum emboitments open of their own accord
28077,take care the research is far from complete
28078,doctor
28079,doctor
28080,no thanks doctor im staying with you youre the only insurance policy ive got
28081,doctor stop him hes getting away
28082,and what a waste of two more brilliant minds if we dont do something soon
28083,i can
28084,what
28085,bubble memory
28086,no as a matter of fact i dont doctor
28087,which would be great if we had a computer to run it on
28088,earth
28089,were being taken right out of time and space
28090,im very grateful
28091,the pharos computer room
28092,excellent doctor envy is the beginning of all true greatness
28093,its the lightspeed overdrive doctor youll need that to accelerate the signal from the transmitter
28094,oh doctor you can explain
28095,what makes you think this programme of the monitors is going to work doctor
28096,its in the very nature of things for entropy to win
28097,woolly thinking doctor
28098,the dawns coming up there are security guards outside
28099,its still not running the programmes useless its time to abandon this line of reasoning
28100,well
28101,if you call this alien gibberish a programme
28102,first we must reach the transmitter and connect up the light speed overdrive
28103,what about the guards
28104,impossible the light speed overdrives disconnected
28105,i agree too for what its worth
28106,from here charged vacuum emboitment is in line with the constellation cassiopeia
28107,you see doctor i overlook nothing
28108,i gave you this to demonstrate my trust
28109,but i dont take foolish risks the real light speed overdrive is here
28110,peoples of the universe please attend carefully the message that follows is vital to the future of you all
28111,so it works congratulations doctor i always knew youd do it
28112,oh no i was little more than a humble assistant but i have learned a great deal and now i think its time for you to go and explain the presence of your friends theres quite a hubbub outside
28113,i know that doctor and it could happen so easily
28114,the universe is hanging on a thread a single recursive pulse down that cable and the cve would close forever even a humble assistant could do it
28115,no doctor im merely reporting the state of affairs i have it in my power now to save them or destroy them
28116,back doctor the proceedings must not be interrupted its mine the cve its all mine
28117,doctor doctor
28118,doctor
28119,so he was the doctor all the time
28120,that boy never even said thank you
28121,he shouldve told me thats what he wanted i couldve shown him brisbane
28122,but romanas gone doctor
28123,we said goodbye to her at the gateway dont you remember
28124,are you sure youre alright
28125,and the regeneration
28126,a databank
28127,i was born there doctor
28128,if i f stands for index file
28129,no i have to stay with you doctor
28130,right d s you know once you get into it this whole funny system on the tardis does start to make a sort of weird sense except this  tardis flight data programmed journey departure earth pharos project destination hydrogen in rush event one
28131,were on a programmed flight we wont crash at least i dont think so
28132,oh no you cant escape youre mine adric mine until we have completed our final task
28133,thank heavens
28134,doctor are you all right
28135,i think the noise came from this direction
28136,doctor
28137,actually doctor its me my lipstick we passed this way before
28138,doctor what does the zero room look like
28139,come on doctor through this way
28140,it smells like roses
28141,will you have to stay here long
28142,the synapses yes
28143,i get it the zero room cuts out all interference
28144,but there isnt even a bed
28145,can anybody do that
28146,thats odd
28147,sorry i didnt mean to wake you
28148,for us
28149,nyssa
28150,adrics
28151,well doctor
28152,outside youd better read this
28153,all hogwash we found the databank maybe well learn how to fly the machine
28154,you must control these dangerous emotions adric theyll only cause you pain besides interfering with the reception now closer
28155,closer adric i must see them       the doctor spots a piece of the waistcoat on the floor he circles to pick it up then quotes fortinbras from a hrefhttp
28156,you must go back
28157,but the doctors our only chance unless we can find some way of getting the temperature down
28158,i sympathise this is all too easy a great pity these facile victories only leave me hungry for more conquest
28159,not till now
28160,dont worry doctor well get you straight back to the zero room
28161,but how will it help to change the tardis rooms around
28162,delete them you mean zap
28163,yes were converting the mass of the deleted tardis rooms into momentum but i still dont understand about momentum
28164,does it mean burning up part of the tardis
28165,adric hes er
28166,its cooler already thats something
28167,we thought he was in the zero room
28168,his adrenalines normalising it was helping to bridge the synapses
28169,which twenty five percent doctor
28170,thats a thought doctor please one last thing
28171,how do we make sure we dont jettison the console room
28172,whats the problem
28173,so doctor you have survived but at what cost i wonder
28174,the data bank is certain its the best place to recuperate its in andromeda a small planet of the phylox series
28175,dont worry doctor tegan thinks shes learnt how to set the coordinates
28176,well thats what she said
28177,what do you mean
28178,please
28179,seems you were wrong about tegans ability to fly the tardis doctor
28180,then whos controlling the ship
28181,it must be tegan
28182,well soon have you safe heres the zero room
28183,on zeroing the coordinate differential automatic systems reactivate the realworld interface see main door the opening of not much here about landing procedure hope its as simple as it seems
28184,what do i do with this
28185,touchdown weve made it weve made it
28186,it looks very small doctor
28187,well be carrying the doctor dont forget
28188,eh
28189,what happened
28190,i really think we should get help
28191,weve got to find the doctor until hes properly regenerated hes terribly vulnerable
28192,perhaps hes found a way in       nyssa
28193,who are you stranger
28194,oh i admire a man with an open mind my own is closed upon the opinion that i am shardovan i have the honour to be librarian for the dwellings of castrovalva
28195,books are the principal business of a library sir
28196,far too much in my opinion there is in this town of castrovalva sir a general dedication to bodily inertia that quite defies description
28197,yes and rest you shall sir some refreshment and then we must show you to your quarters
28198,in pursuit of which belief he drives us to hunt animals in the wilds beyond the walls
28199,the garments with which we stir our courage to the hunt sir are relics of our ancestors a smaller breed of men who as i believe wore down their stature with too much hunting you will notice i am tall
28200,hmm
28201,the stranger is recovering his wits a mild medicament distilled from herbs
28202,a master of physic yes
28203,the portreeve certainly no one of us else is of the least importance
28204,good night
28205,drink its a simple to promote healing sleep
28206,shush its past my bed time if they knew i was abroad they would press me to this feast for me as for you sir sleep is sometimes better nourishment than good red meat please drink sir
28207,excellent youll very soon find the doctor
28208,i know these things
28209,by the simplest of means when you visit breakfast with me tomorrow you will see the source of what my friends are pleased to call my great wisdom now sir sleep
28210,oh yes doctor very soon
28211,good night doctor
28212,doctor
28213,but youve done it boy a perfect impersonation of yourself now we will remain untroubled by the doctors meddling while our plans mature
28214,i fear we must be a little dull after the habitual excitements you describe
28215,then you shall theres something i want to show the doctor
28216,remarkable isnt it
28217,the technical section is not large you will find but you are welcome to browse
28218,life here in the main is very slow and unremarkable only an occasion like your visit disturbs the cycles enough to register on the tapestry
28219,our forbears had many skills now forgotten
28220,oh theres no doubt some complexity behind it but in view of what you told me you had better avoid such things until you are restored
28221,three doctor
28222,lets take them back to the doctors room
28223,three sir
28224,three sir is what comes after two
28225,and then four and then five and then six and then seven
28226,the history of castrovalvas fascinating
28227,sorry
28228,no adric told me not to
28229,im im so sorry doctor but
28230,then we must intervene
28231,the zero cabinet
28232,but once you get outside the walls
28233,i dont remember this
28234,for reasons of health if not of courtesy
28235,out sir if you insist
28236,that wretched square again doctor whats happening
28237,its as if space had folded in on itself
28238,what is it doctor
28239,oh thank goodness we must get him back in the zero cabinet immediately
28240,the portreeve hell help us wait here doctor
28241,just take us to him
28242,here are the other fifteen volumes put them down there
28243,all right run along
28244,it and what sir is it
28245,well sir the town square the library the portreeves house and my own pharmacy in fine sir the dwellings of castrovalva
28246,strange question shardovan has asked the same
28247,he too can be a little fevered in his imaginings this will dispel your fatigue
28248,because sir i maintain i am and i am a man of my word
28249,come on we must get this back to the doctor straightaway
28250,up here sir and down here and round here and along here also
28251,no sir i have but one
28252,it may be approached sir by many different routes
28253,you understand medicine doctor
28254,we found it and no thanks to these castrovalvan people they kept leading us round and round and back to the square
28255,nothing is more certain sir
28256,there is something amiss with the map
28257,i am a rational man sir explain this interesting idea
28258,doctor the cabinet
28259,yes why
28260,from castrovalvas first beginnings to the present day
28261,what do you say sir
28262,how can you tell
28263,yes what doctor
28264,something about the real history doctor
28265,this is shardovans hand the librarian
28266,by a woman
28267,what all thirty volumes
28268,explain yourself sir
28269,ah my natural indolence would not permit it
28270,ah mere fancies sir notes for a fiction i had a mind to write
28271,well sir
28272,no but as you guessed doctor we people of castrovalva are too much part of this thing you call the occlusion
28273,doctor
28274,now doctor
28275,my dear friends its we whove been betrayed
28276,you do have doubts weve spoken of it often
28277,shush
28278,but doctor its
28279,my own adaptation of the block transfer computation since we last me adrics mathematical powers have been put to lively use
28280,that too you were wise to deter your young friends from approaching the hadron power lines are lethal to the touch
28281,yes a trap has now been sprung we can begin to dispose of all the bait
28282,i populated castrovalva i will dispose of these creatures as i choose
28283,well doctor
28284,shardovan
28285,the master has escaped
28286,where are we going
28287,this way
28288,the masters tardis
28289,how do we get out
28290,i can see
28291,what exactly am i looking for doctor
28292,over there the hillside
28293,this is it this is the way
28294,doctor quickly weve got to leave before it closes again
28295,and the master
28296,why couldnt we just walk
28297,i did doctor
28298,i followed the instructions in the computer
28299,but
28300,so i didnt fly it
28301,oh how disappointing
28302,are you sure youre up to flying the tardis
28303,yes
28304,weve arrived
28305,a778 seventeen thirty hours
28306,doesnt look much like heathrow to me
28307,but heathrow is on the m4 not corfu
28308,looks like some kind of a control room
28309,good then i can catch a train
28310,what
28311,but it is home
28312,is it      monarch
28313,so much for promises youve lost me my job
28314,men
28315,yes doctor
28316,thats a resonant stroboscope isnt it
28317,whats that
28318,but cant i stay here
28319,no ill come
28320,molecular structure of intruding artefact consistent with destination earth and its solar system
28321,look at that
28322,this ones for measuring gravitation waves
28323,same thing
28324,except on traken the interferometer superceded the crystal
28325,doctor dont we have some kind of a sonic
28326,look a door
28327,no
28328,well fetch them ill set up
28329,welcome i am monarch
28330,and this is enlightenment
28331,and this is persuasion
28332,and you are

28395,of course theyre mad a hundred generations on this thing theyve got to be mad
28396,comes to the same thing
28397,but were talking of flesh and blood
28398,whats generation in years
28399,two thousand five hundred years
28400,like i feel awful
28401,but thats mad
28402,so do i pure logic
28403,are you saying that this aborigine was taken twelve thousand years ago
28404,then what are you saying
28405,then what are we going to do
28406,none he will take the action he has a sonic device primitive but effective hell want to explore arrange a recreational to divert him but keep him separated from the boy or girl they will tell me more about this doctor than he will himself
28407,doctor weve lost the others
28408,but we cant just leave them
28409,your majesty
28410,welcome to our recreational
28411,where are your junior companions

28413,shouldnt we look for the others
28414,what if they harm them
28415,i dont know why but i think they will
28416,it doesnt have to i think theyre mad i think you are too
28417,why
28418,i want to look as if im explaining the contest i must see you in private as soon as possible
28419,good could you divert the attention of a monopticon
28420,in ten seconds please
28421,are you not well doctor
28422,what was all that about
28423,so thats what they do in here
28424,so you last left urbanka twelve hundred and fifty years ago
28425,this is my memory of two thousand five hundred and fifty five years linked to that which is my reason my intelligence linked to that which is my motor power
28426,not in itself as with all technology it is the use to which it is put
28427,whats a nanometre
28428,no im sorry i cant believe that
28429,not so many some are slaves robots they have but one chip the motor circuit those are they that wear the discs
28430,i am thinking
28431,the reason for monarchs invasion of earth the visits established its suitability
28432,what
28433,and the fossilisation
28434,unless he is stopped he will eventually destroy earth just as he destroyed urbanka
28435,a lie he exhausted the planet of its minerals and then polluted it with his technology the pollution destroyed the ozone layer and left ultraviolet light to scorch urbanka
28436,his great plan for him to travel faster than light
28437,monarch is obsessed with solving the riddle of the universe
28438,dont be afraid one only harms that which one fears
28439,i am powerless alone i have free will but built into my circuits is a failsafe mechanism any aggressive intent is immediately signalled and baulked
28440,no no no no no
28441,im sick of leaving everything to you
28442,you must be mad
28443,how weve got to get out of here weve got to get to the tardis and get out of here
28444,im not thinking of myself weve got to get to earth and warn them
28445,we can try
28446,doctor
28447,i wont stay here
28448,dont leave me please
28449,you reversed the magnetic field
28450,you can take that off to conserve it the life support system is on that red light indicates it
28451,yes but it is an automatic control
28452,i should think so indeed
28453,yes this is all that was saved from urbanka
28454,for those who need it
28455,and this is the graveyard of all those taken from earth
28456,many after the experiments only the highest intelligence was allowed to live on as i
28457,this is where the metamorphoses are performed with him in charge here in these drawers lie the urbankans the future inhabitants of earth
28458,all must be destroyed
28459,this is how the process works the subject is hypnotised and their memory recorded the subject is then terminated and their body used to fertilise the flora chamber by zeus one of you is already in there
28460,oh doctor thank you
28461,ill be all right in a minute they were going to kill me
28462,i think hes all right they sent him to look for you they want the key to the tardis
28463,come on
28464,no they have been corrupted by power they have been promised as i was dominion over their ethnic groups on earth
28465,not for me in a civilised world there is no substitute for democracy
28466,nowhere
28467,the armoury is in the throne room
28468,doctor may i have your sonic screwdriver
28469,id like to try something this has an electric charge hasnt it
28470,doctor doctor its tegan shes trying to move the tardis

28472,you may keep the pencil release him you will turn out your pockets doctor
28473,what is this
28474,this
28475,and this
28476,ah doctor your machine is reluctant to break free from mine
28477,a more considerate guest than you perhaps
28478,doctor
28479,not as they were reported to me
28480,not this time was it scientific curiosity which caused you to interfere with my monopticons
28481,control let there be a recreational for while my eyes are restored from the results of the doctors scientific curiosity i would have my family under my benevolent gaze you have my permission to withdraw
28482,well thats all right and nothing will happen to nyssa as long as you
28483,what      adric
28484,all right

28507,what are we going to do
28508,we have this
28509,here used for repairs and maintenance topsides our lubrication freezes and our joints seize up
28510,the doctor and the boy adric are conspicuous by their absence to say nothing of bigon
28511,yes but monarch or one of his ministers can countermand any order
28512,only by decircuiting them
28513,wait there is a way there is a failsafe mechanism a faulty circuit once gave rise to development of reason a potential for revolt any collective activity automatically jams the androids circuits nyssa relieve him

28798,this planet is totally unsuitable for full scale colonisation the unit be withdrawn sanders is pleased
28799,he wants to stay here i told him he should just wander off into the forest nobodyd notice shame about poor old hindle though
28800,i dont think so
28801,it was all right at first but its all a bit too green for me  nyssa
28802,you dont actually go into space in that
28803,unlikely anyway

28820,doctor
28821,doctor
28822,thats great perhaps i can go out file a claim on the land when they get round to inventing the aircraft ill make a fortune
28823,you call three hundred years a small error
28824,why do you always have some incomprehensible answer
28825,call yourself a time lord a broken clock keeps better time than you do at least its accurate twice a day which is more than you ever are
28826,i think shes finding the idea of going more painful than she thought
28827,perhaps youd better talk to her
28828,im sorry too but you did make a promise
28829,im not sure i want to this place stinks
28830,look doctor
28831,some sort of volcanic action
28832,are you sure this is earth
28833,is it sensible to go on
28834,ive lost my bearings already
28835,whats wrong
28836,shouldnt we get back to the tardis
28837,oh tremendous
28838,can i be of any assistance
28839,i dont think they will bother us again if the lad can walk my camp is this way
28840,for the last night or two fortune has made me itinerant
28841,you dont know
28842,everywhere that is why the village is guarded so vigilantly theyre terrified of strangers and the pestilence they may carry
28843,alas because of the plague everywhere is unfriendly
28844,yes
28845,oh the worst ive ever seen more virulent here than in the city but thats only to be expected
28846,oh completely
28847,call it what you wish i have seen many falling stars but this was without parallel
28848,doctor dont you think we should be getting back to the tardis
28849,oh surely i found it in the loft last night
28850,its made from polygrite isnt it
28851,from such a primitive society
28852,as you wish sir
28853,what exactly are we looking for
28854,how could it have got here
28855,some sort of a spacecraft landing
28856,but surely for the bracelet to be here some of the crew must have survived
28857,then there are survivors
28858,surely you must be aware sir that there is a certain protocol to be observed when approaching the gentry
28859,shouldnt we use the tradesmans entrance
28860,please sir knock with a little more humility
28861,can we come with you
28862,then who was the miller visiting
28863,shall i let the others in
28864,why are you so certain the aliens have come here
28865,they could also have died from the plague
28866,have you any idea who the aliens might be
28867,why are you so concerned about them they might be friendly
28868,so what are you going to do if you find them
28869,i hope they have arms to twist
28870,whats that
28871,look a power pack
28872,i think we should go doctor
28873,what
28874,scarring from a high energy beam
28875,so much for my friendly aliens
28876,now what
28877,as a rule
28878,does it matter
28879,perhaps theres another way
28880,we should join the doctor
28881,doctor
28882,what an incredible illusion
28883,how do you do that
28884,i dont see it
28885,is it an energy barrier
28886,but if the barriers open why cant we see through it
28887,with a trick like that you could make a fortune around the fairgrounds
28888,any survivors
28889,whats that smell
28890,whod want this sort of atmosphere its stifling
28891,its locked
28892,its so gloomy
28893,why do we lurk in this cellar when there is a whole house to loot
28894,i wonder what those are for
28895,you recognise any characteristics
28896,doctor look
28897,you stupid
28898,what about tegan
28899,doctor
28900,your doctor is a dead man you saw what was in the cellar the great reaper death
28901,well what was it then
28902,android your brain is addled sir that was death you saw what effect my pistols had on him
28903,is tegan dead
28904,away
28905,i would rather be sealed up in a plague house sir than stay here
28906,how can that control anyone
28907,nonsense sir that glow is a conjuring trick im a man of the theatre im not impressed by trickery however clever it is
28908,how does this android as you call him come from another world there are no other worlds any fool knows that
28909,im asking you for the last time where are you from
28910,what about adric and tegan
28911,but how we havent any weapons
28912,yes
28913,really and how close do we have to get for it to have an effect
28914,doctor you cannot afford to improvise against an armed android
28915,madam it shames me to tell you but i i will not go back inside that house
28916,yes i will sir
28917,activate the poacher and his friends i want them to bring me the doctor then get a group of villagers to search for the tardis
28918,the place has been stripped
28919,what is this structure
28920,flies
28921,but how are the dimensions greater within
28922,and how is it lit
28923,this is all thats left of the craft that brought the android to earth
28924,its true
28925,how do you know all these things
28926,you can trust us
28927,oh sure but how
28928,and androids
28929,are you still sure the sonic booster can deal with it
28930,but it didnt kill tegan
28931,then wed better hurry up with that booster
28932,how can you possibly get that
28933,then may i accompany you
28934,it seems ive little choice
28935,he has a bracelet
28936,you forget sir im an actor as well as a highwayman
28937,theyre useless anyway i didnt have time to reload them
28938,you are the doctor
28939,you will come with us
28940,right we are ready to engage them
28941,what is that
28942,hell never cut through that hatch
28943,what are you trying to do
28944,oh im dead im afraid my frame was never designed for rapid acceleration
28945,yes the miller has one you could steal it
28946,doctor you cant steal the poor mans horse
28947,alone
28948,very well
28949,even sooner if at all possible
28950,i am not moving
28951,ah the object of my desire
28952,shush shush shush sir thievery is a matter of stealth not hearty greetings
28953,there is someone in the house destroy them go
28954,you heard what the gentleman said
28955,are you capable of carrying a tired thespian eh
28956,now
28957,youre mistaken sir
28958,execute them
28959,no trust me
28960,i have appeared before some of the most hostile audiences in the world today i met death in a cellar but ive never been so afraid until i met the man with the scythe
28961,should i care he saved our lives
28962,i thought you wanted to meet them
28963,it couldnt be worse than what weve just experienced
28964,i feel my mind slipping into a bottomless pit of gloom and despair
28965,is that wise
28966,you are to be taken to the manor house
28967,what happened
28968,you were possessed theres evil at work here the plague carriers are warlocks as well
28969,i think hes asleep
28970,but what about us eh i think our jailers sound decidedly against us
28971,i fear the gentleman who built this wall knew his trade too well
28972,itd better
28973,she is wearing a bracelet
28974,what now
28975,you will remain silent
28976,your friends are of no interest to me
28977,help me you would help a terileptil
28978,you must think me a fool
28979,look at me doctor do you see this this is not natural to my physiognomy
28980,how do you know that
28981,and to be sentenced to raaga is always for life
28982,doctor i am a fugitive the last place i want to go is home only death awaits me there
28983,ah yes to live a primitive life without grace or beauty
28984,but we would have no ship and without one we would be defenceless prey to any terileptil scout party
28985,no doctor a barren rock in space is not an acceptable alternative especially when you are my prisoner and your ship is for the taking
28986,you are not in a position to refuse
28987,oh we shall see that it is handled with the utmost care
28988,if it not been badly damaged in an asteroid storm it would have not succumbed to the gravitational pull of this planet
28989,it cost the lives of all but myself and three of my comrades
28990,three now but it is enough
28991,you are assuming we plan to coexist
28992,the primitives on this planet are too wilful and aggressive i have little need for them especially now we have your tardis
28993,is he a primitive
28994,fit the primitive with a bracelet
28995,oh no
28996,it created the confusion i wanted
28997,i have always found fear an excellent tool
28998,a noble death they were allowed to die fighting
28999,no your mind would override the effects
29000,war is honourable doctor even on this planet it is considered so
29001,get off
29002,hurry help the others
29003,drop the sonic device
29004,it is with some sadness that i tell you you are about to join it
29005,if i did that youd be more of a menace than all the primitives on this planet
29006,and then there would be the argument over the tardis ah you would have made a useful ally but im afraid i think you are better dead i said i would demonstrate how im to rid this planet of all its primitives its very simple
29007,the infection it now carries has been genetically reengineered although heavily infected it will outlive you all
29008,i have thousands of them they are awaiting release in a nearby city their infection will kill every living thing
29009,ah but our rats will ensure there are no survivors a final visitation
29010,now we have your tardis we can travel the universe and acquire androids
29011,its survival doctor just as these primitives kill lesser species to protect themselves so i kill them
29012,its not supposed to be an argument its a statement if you try to escape or interfere with this cage your friends controlled minds have but one thought to kill you
29013,what happened
29014,how do you know that
29015,groggy sore and badtempered
29016,im a man of iron
29017,have no fear i am at hand have you a piece of wire
29018,can the terileptil really do what he said
29019,well i meant on such a scale
29020,but to kill all those people its monstrous
29021,cant we risk it
29022,yeah but that was handcuffs im talking about a door lock look for all we know the terileptil and the android could be miles away by now
29023,five seconds longer
29024,you missed you wasted our only shot
29025,theres your shot there is the lock a span separates them both
29026,not again
29027,is he all right
29028,but where
29029,well never find them there
29030,oh you think theyll have left a forwarding address
29031,i cant make head nor tail of this
29032,its all mathematical formulae
29033,im so glad youre impressed
29034,i mean we cant even read them
29035,what is it
29036,oh great youve liberated a whole lot of villagers what about the base
29037,just like you found heathrow
29038,its still locked
29039,that exit is impossible my dear sir i would never get through it
29040,looks more like overkill to me
29041,cant be
29042,what is that
29043,whats wrong
29044,maybe she was damaged by the booster
29045,we made it doctor tegan youre safe
29046,come on doctor be grateful if nothing else it saved us a long walk
29047,ask the doctor
29048,where are we going
29049,you know where he is
29050,will you please tell me why were doing this
29051,what is it
29052,how do you know its their base
29053,why didnt you say thats what you were looking for
29054,but where are the terileptils they could be anywhere around here
29055,where are they
29056,welcome doctor
29057,i was expecting my android but if you have brought the tardis here yourself so be it
29058,whats that
29059,nightwatchman fetch a squirter arouse the street
29060,im afraid your pace of life is a little to fast for me sir i shall stay here and fight the fire a much much quieter occupation
29061,goodbye doctor
29062,ah
29063,doctor shouldnt we have helped put out the fire we are partially responsible
29064,how do you mean
29065,i did say i wanted to stay with the crew for a while you can stop trying to get me back to heathrow

29144,my father gave me that when i was six
29145,an indian
29146,madge

29148,the man in the cupboard
29149,with the lip
29150,from brazil
29151,you refuse to name yourself or give any good account of yourself except some irresponsible fiction and you were seen to kill a man heaven knows what your motive was but no doubt that will come out during the course of the enquiries
29152,i must warn you that anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence
29153,his accomplices must come too
29154,thank you charles

29162,it was on the north bound platform at the railway station weve been able to move it but we cant break in no key will unlock it
29163,yes mother
29164,i must say all this is going to be rather difficult to explain in my report in this sense you are owed an apology
29165,well there is still a murder to be explained  cummings
29166,a call from lord cranleigh sir up at the hall hes found another body a man called digby his necks broken just like the servant james
29167,come on markham
29168,hes started a fire get the brigade
29169,what was that thing
29170,how did you know

29173,there they are
29174,george please george
29175,theres something id like you to have
29176,it isnt worth it
29177,why
29178,why should that interest me
29179,im fed up
29180,im tired of being considered a joke
29181,then why am i constantly teased
29182,yeah but not as often as me
29183,no and i suppose neither is the fact that whenever nyssa or tegan ask you a question you always find time to answer it but hardly ever with me oh look doctor how am i to learn if you never find time to explain
29184,im just fitted in when its convenient for you
29185,no youve said that too often before doctor there will always be some distraction to prevent it happening
29186,just as you gave your word to tegan
29187,no it never is when youre being criticised is it just as its never your fault when something goes wrong
29188,theres lots more
29189,it isnt difficult  doctor
29190,tell him what
29191,no to terradon
29192,i could plot a course
29193,i have the mathematical skill
29194,the monitor on logopolis indicated they were not random
29195,then i will find someone who will take me
29196,is it really that dangerous
29197,can i use your computer
29198,where are we
29199,oh not again
29200,the year is 2526 in the time scale you call anno domini
29201,why have we materialised underground
29202,i dont need his help thank you very much
29203,do you know i think since his regeneration hes become decidedly immature
29204,that one of the lifeforms has two hearts
29205,breathe deeply and relax now go and make it up with adric please
29206,look at his calculations before you decide it may be possible
29207,unshoulder arms set them on stun
29208,doctor theres something wrong
29209,well it should be totally dark but we can see
29210,and something else
29211,dinosaurs
29212,i hope not
29213,oh thank you very much most of them had a brain the size of a pea
29214,in what way
29215,how long did they exist
29216,how could such a successful species die out so quickly
29217,caused by what an ice age
29218,an asteroid
29219,things have collided with the earth before what was so different about the one that destroyed the dinosaurs
29220,youre forgetting displacement
29221,would it have blocked out the sun
29222,right prepare to move out
29223,i wonder what evolutionary stage my ancestors were at
29224,sergeant sergeant mitchell sergeant sergeant mitchell
29225,no
29226,i said shut up
29227,all right keep searching let me know when you find anything
29228,now where have you gone
29229,we didnt do it
29230,is this why you killed them
29231,open the hatch
29232,ill try
29233,who are they
29234,androids are they yours
29235,yes
29236,no there isnt a reason
29237,our weapons have no effect on them
29238,got him
29239,will they attack again
29240,what are they doing
29241,but why
29242,yes
29243,what could be in there thats worth so many lives
29244,i havent had much experience of fighting androids
29245,only they function much more logically
29246,adric
29247,so are we
29248,go on
29249,they wont care theyll react theyve no choice
29250,i hope youre right
29251,they must be stopped immediately
29252,whos that boy
29253,its very primitive
29254,look at this
29255,yes doctor
29256,oh something wrong
29257,what does that mean
29258,carrier signal now being transmitted beam locked on
29259,what about you
29260,can you see what it is
29261,the device is already lost let the earth see the effectiveness of cyber technology explode the bomb
29262,youve checked for booby traps
29263,come on lad
29264,they are too late
29265,we thought a booby trap had gone off
29266,what is it
29267,how much time have we got
29268,come on you cant stay behind
29269,it would be nice to know what youre doing
29270,can you jam it
29271,how long does an arming procedure take
29272,but youve already jammed the signal
29273,magnetic clamp how much damage could this bomb do
29274,enough for what
29275,probe do you know i find this whole situation so bizarre i mean theres just no purpose to it
29276,look professor kyle said shed been down here four weeks before the androids attacked
29277,laser cutter
29278,it would have made more sense if they had
29279,yes i suppose that has a certain logic
29280,magnetic drone
29281,whats happened
29282,but the transmitter doesnt
29283,but there cant be much time left what can we do
29284,doctor
29285,its not our problem doctor
29286,what is that i know that object
29287,youve done so much we want to show you our gratitude
29288,you could afford to spare them a few hours doctor
29289,where are we rushing off to
29290,do you know where they are
29291,we cant fight androids by ourselves
29292,indeed
29293,its bigger than you think
29294,yes doctor
29295,well
29296,thats all right
29297,all part of the daily routine
29298,and
29299,well ive already done so doctor
29300,as you can see here ive even managed to calculate the way into the cve the gateway through espace
29301,thank you
29302,so am i i overreacted
29303,no of course not theres nothing there for me any more
29304,this is where the beam came from
29305,the freighter could be nothing more than a relay point
29306,may i come
29307,excellent
29308,look arent we being a bit casual about this
29309,there must be a crew

29317,doctor we have got to get out of here
29318,on this ship we execute murderers
29319,no tricks
29320,theres no hurry theyre quite dead arent they
29321,theres nothing you can say
29322,the crew is small they will offer little resistance
29323,its quite all right ringway i can fight my own battles thank you i suppose youre going to say you know nothing about the disappearance of three of my crew members
29324,its all true
29325,are you trying to make a fool of me
29326,hes just wasting time
29327,it doesnt follow that ive got a band of conspirators at work on the ship
29328,yes i want things to settle down before we go out
29329,well get a squad down there at once
29330,not without closing down half the ship its a main cable
29331,who
29332,i will not risk losing my bonus for a few miserable stowaways
29333,we havent got time if im late delivering my cargo i not only lose my bonus but i have to pay a heavy fine
29334,i will not stop this ship
29335,do you remember what you asked me after we deactivated the bomb
29336,well with the earth on red alert a missile wouldnt get through
29337,stand by the security cameras are on the blink
29338,weve regained full power right on your feet you two
29339,are these your friends
29340,what are they
29341,are they robots
29342,shut up im tired of your snide remarks and bullying ways
29343,you know them
29344,you traitor
29345,they must have paid you a lot for this
29346,shut up
29347,why
29348,where do these cybermen come from
29349,perhaps you overestimate your importance
29350,trying to hide it from me were you
29351,berger wheres berger
29352,theyll last until we get back to earth
29353,theres only a few of them our security men will cope with them
29354,we could pump all the air out of the hold
29355,would threatening to kill him slow those tin things down
29356,youre all dead why dont you surrender
29357,doctor
29358,so
29359,a stabilised vessel bergers the expert
29360,yes the machinerys here
29361,are we going to stabilise the shield
29362,just explain what youre trying to do
29363,well tell me quickly
29364,thats not possible
29365,will you just try and explain what youre doing
29366,but no such material exists
29367,youre saying that that machine will constantly adjust and readjust the molecular structure of the antimatter vessel
29368,thats very clever
29369,but will the device work to stabilise the shield
29370,id better tell the computer what were up to
29371,not before weve found the doctor and adric
29372,hurry doctor
29373,fire
29374,so we meet again doctor
29375,he deceived us
29376,our records indicate that you have a fondness for earth
29377,it is a word like any other and so is destruction which is what we are going to do to that planet
29378,i dont know theyve incorporated a machine of their own
29379,are we still going to earth
29380,well then why lock off the coordinates
29381,your tardis has been found doctor
29382,there is a conference about to take place on earth
29383,yes the heads of many powerful planets will be present
29384,it is more than that the purpose of the conference is to sign a pact uniting their military forces in a war against the cyber race
29385,their combined forces would be too great
29386,it will be a great psychological victory the strength and might of the cyber race will be confirmed
29387,no but weve got separated from tegan
29388,i shall not be on board doctor
29389,are they all so dedicated
29390,doctor adric
29391,who is this woman
29392,thanks a lot
29393,shes one of your crew
29394,i see that time lords have emotional feelings
29395,surely a great weakness in one so powerful
29396,they restrict and curtail the intellect and logic of the mind
29397,these things are irrelevant
29398,you have affection for this woman
29399,and you do not consider friendship a weakness
29400,kill her
29401,such a reaction is not a disadvantage
29402,yes although your presence isnt needed of course the control of your ship is now totally automatic
29403,and deny them the feeling of fear the ultimate in emotional response
29404,the name is tegan
29405,no
29406,i know that it requires only one person to pilot the tardis
29407,just leave
29408,goodbye doctor
29409,marshall you stay there and cover us brooks come with me
29410,have you locked on to the freighters coordinates
29411,it seems we have very little time captain
29412,cant you do something
29413,she doesnt have to be here
29414,gently this is my planet theyre about to destroy
29415,where have they gone
29416,you will follow
29417,you will board the freighter
29418,you will do as i say
29419,dont tell me it isnt
29420,is that true
29421,weve come out of warp drive
29422,my guards evacuating the ship
29423,big deal
29424,the freighter
29425,the freighter was the meteorite
29426,you lie doctor
29427,this is the tardis we have cybermen on board    scott
29428,but you will not enjoy the victory i shall now kill you doctor
29429,please hurry doctor we must get adric off the freighter
29430,look out
29431,emergency we have lost contact with concorde golf victor foxtrot
29432,tegan please
29433,could you
29434,we can change what happened if we materialise before adric was killed
29435,look the freighter could still crash into earth that doesnt have to be changed only adric doesnt have to be on board
29436,so will i
29437,where are we going
29438,1851 earth london whats so special about that doctor
29439,1851 the great exhibition
29440,well the tardis should feel at home
29441,lets get there first
29442,of course not all systems functioning normally
29443,some sort of turbulence
29444,another ship
29445,but were due to land in london in a few minutes
29446,where are we
29447,thats not hyde park thats heathrow airport
29448,what are you doing
29449,youve landed us right in the middle of a terminal building
29450,the authoritiesll go mad
29451,please hurry
29452,doctor
29453,this is the 1980s nyssa police boxes went out with flower power
29454,doctor
29455,are you responsible for this box sir
29456,doctor youve done it again
29457,would you be so good as to open it up sir
29458,i must insist sir security
29459,you have the key sir
29460,sir
29461,and who exactly are you sir
29462,its always the same with you whenever we stop anywhere you have to get involved
29463,we were supposed to be going to the great exhibition
29464,you promised
29465,i am helping by wanting to leave the recovery of concorde to the experts
29466,oh ah oh er how do you do doctor
29467,thats right
29468,well this mornings concorde flight from new york disappeared from the radar just after its deceleration
29469,it was flying on a level course all systems were working normally
29470,wonder what
29471,that forced us to materialise
29472,it sounds as if it could be crosstracing on the timespace axis
29473,are you saying you know where the missing aircraft is
29474,but why does it have to be another concorde
29475,and you really believe that victor foxtrot flew into a time warp
29476,may i introduce my first officer andrew bilton our flight engineer roger scobie
29477,would you mind going back and fastening your seatbelts for takeoff please
29478,do you seriously believe that victor foxtrot got caught in some sort of time slip
29479,hang on a moment though doctor if we follow victor foxtrots course and end up somewhere over the rainbow well were on a oneway ticket just like captain urquharts lot
29480,the tardis you mean that police box
29481,what
29482,i wish id known about that when we were on castrovalva
29483,the column isnt moving
29484,must be a solar flare
29485,london this is golf alpha charlie do you read
29486,theres something very unreal about all of this
29487,whats that doctor
29488,theres nothing there
29489,what are you talking about doctor
29490,you dont give up do you doctor
29491,what are you doing to us doctor
29492,but were at heathrow
29493,im getting cold
29494,where are we
29495,heathrow
29496,i think im dreaming
29497,i dont believe it
29498,the ice age
29499,were they the creatures i saw
29500,do you really mean weve gone backward down a time contour
29501,how did we land on this
29502,but the touchdown was perfect
29503,but the approach to heathrow was utterly real
29504,and doctor somewhere in this wilderness must be the passengers and crew of victor foxtrot
29505,what do you mean
29506,doctor its the other concorde
29507,all things come to their appointed end soon soon
29508,well thats not exactly terminal three but who could have built it
29509,what was the indian rope trick
29510,i just know
29511,am i all right those were the creatures that got hold of bilton and scobie
29512,those blobs
29513,whatever you want to call them
29514,doctor theres no technique that can make matter like that out of thin air
29515,doctor
29516,doctor those people were taking away the tardis
29517,oh this is the doctor
29518,youre all with captain stapley
29519,oh yes
29520,i must have passed out during the hijack i think we all did the next thing i knew we were in this mausoleum theyd got everybody under some sort of hypnosis at darlington thats my speciality so i was able to counter suggest not easy i can tell you hyperstimulation of eidetic images the most powerful hallucinatory induction ive ever come across they must be using ultrasonics
29521,i dont know even the guards are disguised
29522,the what
29523,hayter ive got to find my crew
29524,slave labour i expect
29525,its the radiation i said we should keep away from this place
29526,do not approach the citadel return to your ship there is great danger
29527,whats happening to her
29528,more like hysteria triggered by ultrasonics
29529,its the same stuff as the plasmatons are made out of
29530,weve got to get her out of there
29531,we cant just leave her
29532,look if we dont get the tardis back we could be stuck here for ever
29533,you bet good luck
29534,dont you realise weve got to get away from here the effect will only get worse the nearer we get to the centre of the radiation
29535,look if the intelligence is trying to contact us who is trying to stop it
29536,another intelligence
29537,dont you believe it those guards appear from nowhere
29538,what do you mean
29539,such as the shield around nyssa
29540,well some form of projection maybe part hallucination scientifically speaking even
29541,theres bilton and scobie
29542,i doubt if they can even remember their names theyre in a state of trance
29543,i am kalid
29544,have a care doctor you were not summoned to my domain to play the clown
29545,here kalid rules
29546,what troubles your mind doctor
29547,shall kalid not travel where the spirit leads him
29548,spaceship
29549,space is within us doctor
29550,by the power of the great one in the deserts of arabia i learnt all the magic arts
29551,you mock me doctor but do not doubt that i can summon furies and cacodaemons a company of cherubim or lucifer himself
29552,mechanistic
29553,my familiar spirits have told me of your miraculous cabinet the spirits have told me you would come
29554,i hold the whole genius of night bound to my will and now the great elemental has summoned you doctor
29555,slaves are required in my domain
29556,they have other uses
29557,the power shall be used for the great work we shall do together
29558,together we shall scourge the entirety of space and time
29559,your captain stapley and his fellow mortals
29560,together with your box the power will be absolute we shall command the whole universe
29561,shall i be forced to compel you doctor
29562,who is this man
29563,i dont think so
29564,whats happening
29565,the freedom of yourselves and your fellow passengers is in the hands of the doctor
29566,i require the key of the tardis
29567,come on
29568,not even i have dared penetrate the heart of the citadel
29569,come on
29570,they have entered the sanctum
29571,doctor you will give me the key of the tardis
29572,then you will see your friends here destroyed and you yourself annihilated
29573,these things have proven themselves harmless
29574,bah its just a ball of cotton wool
29575,well doctor
29576,argh no more
29577,theres got to be a perfectly simple orthodox explanation bioenergetic powers intellectual garbage
29578,wont i you come and look at this psychotronics was it doctor i call it electronics
29579,you never do
29580,hold on a moment this crystal theres no connection no radio link
29581,and whats all this equipment for
29582,you are right doctor i need your tardis to penetrate the sanctum
29583,nyssa and tegan dead
29584,i shall soon have total control of the force the tardis key doctor
29585,is that how you travel doctor
29586,some kind of miasma
29587,what ive just seen isnt possible
29588,but if it is how did the girls get in there
29589,but why
29590,right lets go
29591,youll need all the help you can get
29592,the professors the same as us
29593,my fellow passengers
29594,ill say one thing doctor for some of them itll be the first days honest work theyve done in their lives
29595,doctor theyve stopped hallucinating
29596,how do you mean
29597,this is the doctor hes here to help us
29598,do you really think the rest of the crew are all right
29599,were nearly there doctor doctor
29600,that pillar
29601,but its not big enough
29602,this revolutionises the whole concept of relative dimension oh doctor if only i were a younger man and had the time to make use of your knowledge
29603,huh
29604,doctor
29605,i certainly do not
29606,but doctor arent we going into this tardis thing
29607,im not so sure if theres a fault in the tardis we could be marooned in this wilderness forever
29608,ill learn nothing waiting for you here
29609,how are they
29610,doctor
29611,i think so there was an explosion oh my head aches
29612,who are they
29613,sabotage
29614,why did it want me to destroy it
29615,that explosion
29616,that must be when the creature evaporated
29617,two aspects of the same personality the good and the bad
29618,but why should half the creature want to attack us anyway
29619,well the wall just opened
29620,is that what happened to you
29621,i dont understand it the entire walls solid
29622,but if you physically broke through
29623,the passengers why
29624,we are trapped
29625,its some sort of figurine theres another one and another could they be some sort of votive offering in which case this chamber might have some religious significance
29626,youve seen one of these before
29627,the xeraphin
29628,oh doctor please on top of everything else not little green men from outer space
29629,well its a little toy of the masters
29630,but the thing in there is alive and theres only one organism
29631,if thats the case the tardis has turned into a helicopter
29632,why
29633,of course the nucleus is the perfect substitute
29634,the powers returning cant you feel it
29635,dont be afraid doctor
29636,the xeraphin is calling us the xeraphin is very close
29637,the xeraphin contains the wisdom of the universe without the knowledge you cannot escape from the sanctum
29638,stop i shall talk to the xeraphin
29639,im a scientist doctor the chance of inheriting the wisdom of all the universe is an opportunity i cannot ignore
29640,the xeraphin welcomes you professor
29641,roger
29642,hes become a plasmaton
29643,i come in this shape as ambassador of our people
29644,but the sickness followed us
29645,using our psychic power we melded into a unity
29646,yes doctor in that shape we planned to rest until the contamination had passed then we could regenerate
29647,at the moment of regeneration the time lord came seeking our power
29648,those who were first reborn were destroyed
29649,we were forced to retreat to our resting place
29650,through the projection of his mind he communicated with our baseness
29651,the schismatic effect of the time lords intervention we are infinitely divided  listen carefully together we must secure the safety of your friends and yourself and the regeneration of our race
29652,herein the new power the force that binds and shapes us shall be feared and adored nations shall prostrate themselves before us we shall be divinity
29653,winning what for heavens sakes
29654,whats happening now
29655,anithon
29656,i cannot keep this up much longer
29657,too late my brother the master is ready for us
29658,what does that mean
29659,there must be something we can do doctor
29660,even if we found it we wouldnt be able to open it with the xeraphin gone
29661,the people who let the doctor in
29662,the tardis
29663,are we glad to see the tardis
29664,yes didnt you instruct professor hayter on how to fly the tardis
29665,then what did we see if it wasnt hayter
29666,doctor
29667,this place is really getting like heathrow
29668,would that be something like a greek pillar
29669,oh weve lost him
29670,how do you know that
29671,what got me was all the people
29672,yes i mean ive heard of a football team getting into a telephone kiosk but this was ridiculous
29673,how
29674,doctor after that landing i doubt if the aircraft is safe to fly
29675,but what about a runway
29676,right skipper
29677,the passengers what about them
29678,what sort of melt them down
29679,i thought i saw victor foxtrot shimmer must be imagining things
29680,well i cant see anything
29681,where have you been
29682,in the cargo hold of course
29683,well apart from some damage to the hydraulics but well take some bits off victor foxtrot
29684,but doctor it would work
29685,but it is concorde
29686,we must be hallucinating again
29687,but its a plane
29688,then victor foxtrot
29689,no doctor its too dangerous
29690,you know what happened before
29691,were too late with the power of the xeraphin the master will be invincible
29692,were stuck here
29693,your substitution of the temporal limiter for the time lapse compressor
29694,of course not
29695,doctor doctor i think i can explain
29696,yes you see when we were on the tardis i swapped some of the parts around i thought it might put a spanner in the works its a stupid idea really
29697,i can still operate my tardis
29698,very well doctor what are your terms
29699,and what will you give me
29700,doctor the nucleus of the xeraphin
29701,has he agreed
29702,i think id rather hallucinate
29703,well do our best roger andrew lets measure this ground for takeoff
29704,he must be giving him a redundant circuit you know how the doctor collects spare parts
29705,not at all doctor you shall have it when you give me the correctly programmed temporal limiter
29706,oh doctor i shall need an external power supply to start the engines four hundred cycles a hundred and fifteen volts
29707,doctor you havent got the quantum accelerator back from the master
29708,why do we need concorde cant we all go back in the tardis
29709,doctor how are you doing to deal with the master doctor
29710,captain stapley says the aircraft is ready
29711,doctor hurry up the masters getting trigger happy out there
29712,the quantum accelerator
29713,i suppose he could end up anywhere in the universe
29714,what
29715,hell land up in london with that nucleus on board
29716,but thats disaster
29717,ladies and gentlemen we do apologise for the delay your flight is now ready for boarding would you care to proceed to your aircraft immediately
29718,why doesnt it work
29719,what does that mean
29720,ill abandon takeoff prior to v one only on the loss of two engines
29721,where to now doctor
29722,roger speedbird concorde golf alpha charlie descending to three five zero were back
29723,doctor
29724,its gone
29725,the xeraphin will never be able to regenerate
29726,you sent them to xeraphas but the radiation will
29727,hell just take off again
29728,hes stuck on xeraphas
29729,its the doctor
29730,youre amazing doctor
29731,i think im entitled to a few explanations
29732,cut it this is treason i must report it at once
29733,why didnt you do it sooner
29734,itll make quite a difference to have audio linkup on the scanner again
29735,and literally as quiet as the grave
29736,we have an audio system but nothing to listen to
29737,doctor there are many other repairs to do
29738,the navigational system that must be faulty we never seem to arrive where we intend
29739,and thats another thing the tardis used to be in a state of temporal grace you said guns couldnt be fired
29740,it is too late already the tardis is under my control
29741,but theres nothing out there just light years of black empty space
29742,to where
29743,yes
29744,these readings dont make sense
29745,cant you override the control
29746,what is it
29747,a materialisation
29748,doctor oh thank goodness youre all right
29749,not long what was that thing it just appeared from nowhere
29750,has it gone
29751,for a moment i thought it had taken you over
29752,i checked the sensors this creature is formed from antimatter
29753,but the creature failed its not in our dimension now
29754,to remain in this universe the creature would have to reverse its polarity i mean if it failed
29755,q star
29756,thats whats shielding the creature
29757,not much just the name the ancients gave to this region the arc of infinity
29758,so if this creature cant bond with you it can have no real existence in this universe
29759,but to do that it would have to have detailed biological information about you
29760,the security compound and only i am to have access tell my men when the tardis arrives theyll be waiting outside
29761,doctor weve changed course
29762,why
29763,im simply following orders
29764,were locked in
29765,his cousin will arrive at schiphol airport tomorrow morning at ten thirty
29766,why are we locked in surely the time lords have brought you back to help find the creature and prevent its bonding with you
29767,what other reason would there be
29768,to kill you is that why theyve brought you back
29769,you did it
29770,where are we trying to get to
29771,will it be guarded
29772,of that fact i am more than aware if i may pass i must give my report to the lord president
29773,theyve taken the main spacetime element
29774,what do we do now
29775,youre to come with us doctor
29776,they have orders to kill at the slightest sign of resistance
29777,yes
29778,youre not going to believe this
29779,doctor a pleasure to see you again
29780,well doctor an unpleasant business this im sure you understand why the lord president was forced to recall you
29781,if you remember you were asked to return romana and you failed to do so
29782,thats all past history
29783,there hasnt been much time doctor
29784,what are you suggesting doctor
29785,you too have regenerated
29786,the spacetime parameters of the matrix have been invaded by a creature from the antimatter world we know its composition and how unstable is the magnetism that shields it the creature must be expelled immediately if we are to avert disaster
29787,its presence here must be our first concern antimatter cannot coexist in harmony in our universe
29788,we considered this doctor but the implications are quite preposterous
29789,not to my knowledge but the power of this creature is outside the limits of what we know doctor
29790,you know that capital punishment has long been abolished here in gallifrey but there is a precedent for a situation like this have you nothing further to say doctor
29791,no you cant
29792,what would you have us do spare the doctor and condemn untold billions to destruction that is the choice we face here
29793,i must speak to the doctor
29794,i have my orders
29795,you wanted to see me
29796,they have their orders
29797,which is the nearest room
29798,i said difficult nyssa but not impossible especially with one so sensitive to public opinion as the castellan is
29799,the castellan agreed too quickly to our visiting the doctor even if he knows he cant refuse he always attempts to make it appear hes granting you permission i mean thats the castellans way
29800,doctor
29801,councillor hedin arranged it with the castellan
29802,castellan said we might be alone
29803,youre a fool maxil
29804,so there is a traitor
29805,but thats impossible
29806,anything
29807,ill see what i can do anything else
29808,right
29809,you know the choice we have to face doctor our duty if not our conscience is clear
29810,there was one dissenter your good friend councillor hedin
29811,over here doctor
29812,dont you understand the doctor was betrayed his bioscan was extracted from the matrix doctor tell them
29813,but were ready to leave
29814,i hope you know what youve done
29815,doctor doctor you know where you are doctor
29816,only your mind doctor your body is still in the termination area shielded by an energy band
29817,you realised this would happen
29818,and now that you have
29819,i think you should come down here castellan
29820,i considered that but it wouldnt work
29821,i was not always as i am now doctor once i too had life real existence in your dimension soon with your help i shall have it again
29822,doctor i have good news for you doctor since i wish no enmity between us i intend to release you
29823,you will be freed if you give me your word not to interfere
29824,then i am forced to persuade you
29825,a friend of yours doctor please your word not to interfere or she must suffer
29826,please doctor help me
29827,no hes operated the lock
29828,her life depends on you doctor
29829,then see that nothing threatens it the next time we meet it will be on gallifrey goodbye doctor
29830,that is a full analysis of the relevant security circuit traffic study them well councillors they will tell you who it was
29831,how did you manage to open the door
29832,at least you could have told me what you were up to
29833,the tardis element yes
29834,just one item a fusion booster element was transported recently
29835,its a highly advanced piece of equipment unstable but capable of an enormous conversion rate over very short periods
29836,its fuelled by anything that contains hydrogen atoms water would be perfect
29837,shouldnt we go while weve got the chance
29838,earth what for
29839,how do you know
29840,you were right doctor the fusion booster element was transported to earth it could have been anywhere the reception area was lost in severe temporal distortion
29841,we know who sent it though
29842,these codes are unmistakable you used them yourself to get in here
29843,what are you going to do
29844,the castellans guards are all over the place
29845,we must act now thalia
29846,theres no time to explain now
29847,doctor be careful
29848,throw down the weapon
29849,now over there
29850,i did what i had to now do as you are told
29851,nothing must interfere with transfer
29852,very
29853,you dont understand
29854,this is no alien creature doctor its one of us a time lord the first and greatest of our people the one who sacrificed all to give us mastery of time and was shamefully abandoned in return
29855,yes omega
29856,no he exists doctor he only wants to live amongst us and he will as soon as he transfers here
29857,no
29858,hedin is your traitor
29859,it wont prevent transfer
29860,doctor
29861,but you are antimatter
29862,not without hedins help your friend is dead
29863,omega must be found and stopped
29864,would she know their precise location
29865,no omegas mad hell kill her
29866,you know that
29867,we will contrive a way for you to leave
29868,it cost hedins life to convince you
29869,she is
29870,silence girl
29871,silence
29872,amsterdam do you know the precise location of this earth city
29873,well
29874,nyssa
29875,were almost ready to materialise
29876,whats that for
29877,isnt that dangerous
29878,a kind of short circuit
29879,lets hope it gave the doctor all the time he needed
29880,what
29881,it sounds like a power house in there
29882,so
29883,how will you find out
29884,youre dealing with a time lord doctor you wont find answers in there
29885,so

29919,doctor
29920,are you okay
29921,he cant have
29922,things could have been different power and the greatness of omega could have been yours but no your hatred of me

29953,how did i know that
29954,well it made a good story quite made my hair stand on end ambrils predecessor was rather good value even if he was talking nonsense
29955,but why must we
29956,im still possessed arent i doctor the mara from the world of the kinda is still inside my head somewhere isnt it
29957,but you think so
29958,but where
29959,in my dreams
29960,the battle for what
29961,thats why you misread the coordinates
29962,oh my lord
29963,on deva loka the kinda world
29964,its horrible is that thing inside my head you must know i climbed a tree and dropped apples on its head no i will never agree to what you ask doctor am i free of the mara now forever am i
29965,im in my garden silly everything grows in my garden people always come back i close my eyes i want them to come back and they do it always works i can tell lies too people dont always notice so im safe here
29966,im six silly
29967,oh why
29968,no
29969,how about you sir madame step this way if youd be so kind i invite you to take the most exciting journey of all the voyage inside the journey to meet yourself i address you in the silence of your own hearts i offer my personal challenge dare you bare witness to what the mara shows will you gaze upon the unspeakable dare you come face to face with the finally unfaceable children half price
29970,snake mouth cave out
29971,im outside im being fed this image
29972,no mustnt
29973,something in here over there mustnt look mustnt ever look im safe if i dont look
29974,no
29975,that voice what was it
29976,on deva loka you said a physical change took place when possessed by a mara
29977,how
29978,then what
29979,its a real place
29980,id forgotten how impressive it is
29981,she cant dream now shes awake
29982,doctor
29983,doctor
29984,what are we going to do she wont go any further shes too frightened
29985,im very glad the legend of the return is just a story it is isnt it
29986,lon i really think the director should deal with this
29987,research effort into the sumaran era
29988,and where according to you is the mara now
29989,does it
29990,oh how very resourceful
29991,very well show us
29992,is this your companion
29993,doctor shes gone
29994,shes gone apparently
29995,youve disappointed me doctor i should have you punished
29996,yes
29997,terrified
29998,is it well look now
29999,and if shes not
30000,the tardis databanks
30001,oh that man no cant possibly tell him to go away
30002,i know exactly what you want
30003,yes youve come to pester me with some extravagant theory youve dreamed up concerning the mara and should i the director fail to take sufficient notice of your colourful improbabilities it will be the end of civilisation as we know it at least how am i doing so far hmm
30004,sorry to disappoint you but you know youre hardly the first for some reason the study of the sumaran era has always attracted more than its share of cranks particularly when a ceremonys due
30005,commemorating the destruction of the mara by the federation surprise me tell me you didnt know
30006,tomorrow
30007,oh certainly
30008,yes ill cancel the whole thing at once now my assistant will show you out
30009,a dream
30010,it proves nothing merely that hes acquainted with the legend
30011,dont encourage him
30012,the legend tells that the mara was not destroyed by the founders of the federation but only banished
30013,yes
30014,anyway according to the legend the mara will return in a dream
30015,it returns to regain its power over men when the minds meet again in the great crystal
30016,thats enough
30017,now take this for example it dates from the middle sumaran era and unusually is mentioned quite specifically in the legend oh there can be no doubt the reference is to the six faces of delusion now count one two three four five you will observe there are five faces not six as the legend would have it now my point is this i do find it quite extraordinarily difficult to take seriously a legend that cannot even count accurately of course artistically speaking its an entirely different matter the piece is exquisite an undoubted masterpiece
30018,hmm headdress
30019,what
30020,certainly not whatever for
30021,well
30022,one two three four five
30023,why not what are you afraid of just who do you think you are
30024,the snake dancers use them in their rituals they call them little minds eye in the legend the great crystal is named as the great minds eye
30025,perhaps theres a connection perhaps theyre even made of the same substance i dont know ambril refused to let me run the tests
30026,i must go
30027,no of course not
30028,i saw tegan i spoke to her
30029,she was behaving very oddly
30030,i dont
30031,i didnt look i didnt notice
30032,why are we here
30033,so
30034,oh lon do come to the party
30035,could do
30036,mental energy
30037,well presumably the lines go to the heads of the figures
30038,what is
30039,and meeting in the great crystal
30040,but its blank its been scratched out
30041,doctor im not at all clear what were supposed to be doing
30042,what
30043,now
30044,im sorry doctor i cant concentrate hard enough
30045,i feel so foolish
30046,what are you doing
30047,yes
30048,now tell me about the great crystal that interests me it interests me very much indeed
30049,but there was only a blue light
30050,i see
30051,and if the maras in tegans mind
30052,where are you going
30053,a toast to the federation in the person of this charming lady
30054,the what
30055,no really i love surprises
30056,i certainly do
30057,wherever it is i can assure you its perfectly safe
30058,i think weve heard enough take him away
30059,i brought you some food
30060,do you want it
30061,youre to be kept here until after the ceremony this afternoon
30062,no no i understand
30063,i dont know
30064,yes of course i am
30065,because youre not the first dojjen the director before ambril he too was convinced that the mara would return
30066,this is so stupid
30067,there must be something
30068,ive brought you this it was written by dojjen look at the last page
30069,you know i cant do that
30070,no i dont
30071,what
30072,yes i suppose so what are you talking about i thought you might be interested but
30073,well
30074,and it was the last thing dojjen wrote before he
30075,now give it back to me
30076,the snake dance was banned by the federation nearly a hundred years ago
30077,well according to the legend the maras return may only be resisted by those of perfectly clear mind the dance was a dance of purification in readiness for the return however the federation held that the mara no longer existed thats why they drove the snake dancers into the hills oh apparently it involved the use of certain powers
30078,mental powers easily misunderstood
30079,just you wait and see come on
30080,what are we going to do
30081,doctor
30082,weve got to get out of here
30083,if only we still had the sonic screwdriver
30084,what
30085,silence stop wasting time where is the great crystal
30086,doctor what exactly are you asking me
30087,to do with what
30088,to function as they do the crystals must possess a perfect molecular structure tuned to the exact wavelengths of the human mind doctor the crystal is man made
30089,where is the great crystal
30090,what are you saying
30091,but the manussans are not that advanced
30092,but there would be records a people eight hundred years ago capable of molecular engineering
30093,and created the mara
30094,but if dojjen had worked out what had happened
30095,and if he became convinced that the mara would return
30096,then why didnt he simply destroy the great crystal when it was in his charge
30097,and in the meantime
30098,ambril has been showing me around havent you
30099,how can you be so calm what if chela doesnt help
30100,you cant be certain
30101,well showman do you still dream of my success perhaps you do after all you have no choice you have got to look
30102,quiet theres no time
30103,and back to the tardis
30104,isnt it obvious
30105,it is preposterous to think that anyone is plotting against you least of all these people
30106,id expect you to say that
30107,why should the great crystal concern you
30108,the great crystal will be returned to its rightful place during the ceremony
30109,why what
30110,i thought wed cleared that up
30111,im not here to be questioned by you
30112,what are you two talking about
30113,how should i know mother the mans a complete fool
30114,if you wouldnt mind
30115,where are we going
30116,we dont even know if shes still alive
30117,if lon has been affected by the mara why hasnt he changed
30118,but he is influenced
30119,im sorry doctor its just the surprise
30120,youve been touched by an attendant demon you must forfeit a coin its the custom im afraid
30121,on the day of the ceremony the attendant demons seek out the unwary anyone they touch with the evil must pay up or er
30122,have water tipped over their heads its part of the fun
30123,here you are may you never feel the serpents tooth
30124,doctor what are we going to do
30125,well first the great snake is taken in procession through the streets before going up to the cave
30126,a few hours
30127,where are we going
30128,if youd let me steal the great crystal this trek wouldnt be necessary
30129,why not
30130,but how
30131,and you think dojjen will be able to tell us
30132,dojjen hasnt been seen for ten years he could be anywhere assuming hes still alive
30133,how will that help to find him
30134,how far are we going
30135,what now
30136,doctor
30137,so
30138,establishing a mental link
30139,well
30140,if what you say is true why didnt dojjen destroy the great crystal while he was still director
30141,well
30142,doctor no what are you doing
30143,but its bite could be deadly
30144,doctor oh thank goodness i thought for a moment
30145,but how
30146,we must hurry
30147,did you find out what you needed to know
30148,i do not fear i spread my fingers and the dust trickles away i know that whilst i live my hand is clean my eyes are bright that is enough
30149,the ceremony must have started
30150,its nothing its just glass
30151,now give me the great crystal
30152,go on do it now
30153,what is happening who dares to interrupt the becoming who does not believe submit all minds must submit look at me you must look at me you cannot resist it is impossible no stop him he must be stopped help me doctor whats happening to me please look at me doctor i need your help
30154,no the crystal destroy the crystal it will prevent my
30155,it was awful it was awful
30156,the feelings of hate and rage it was terrible i wanted to destroy everything
30157,the maras gone for ever
30158,steady on old chap you had a bit of a knock
30159,im scared
30160,im still having terrible dreams
30161,that could have been prevented if that dojjen person had destroyed the great crystal
30162,the feelings of hate doctor i couldnt go through it again
30163,for all of us i hope
30164,youll forget the mara tegan it wont always be as painful as it is now
30165,cant be that would mean we were near an object in a fixed orbit in time as well as space
30166,are you trying to scare me or is this your way of telling me weve broken down again
30167,so you are real i thought it was just a dream  guardian
30168,dont you know
30169,doctor
30170,weve got to get out of the way
30171,doctor
30172,were going to crash
30173,everything on this ship is designed for pleasure
30174,you dont fly a ship like this its in perpetual orbit
30175,doctor
30176,doctor look at this
30177,the crew escaped in a life raft
30178,where to
30179,a transmat capsule dont you know anything
30180,someone might come back
30181,now what
30182,take it from me boy a solid object just cant dematerialise turlough
30183,doctor
30184,well how is the transmat signal jamming us
30185,well can you switch it off
30186,i hope so too i dont fancy a nonstop mystery tour of the galaxy
30187,you found the fault
30188,earth
30189,so
30190,1977
30191,well if that things back then someone could be on board the ship

30242,not a hundred percent doctor
30243,you and that tardis
30244,oh look its all a long time ago doctor i mean surely whats past is
30245,not much call for that in the a level syllabus doctor
30246,i think i do young lady tell me miss jovanka this friend of yours is it by any chance the doctor    turlough wakes from his nightmare and goes to the door it is still locked he picks up the guardians crystal and wraps it in the bedclothes then uses some clean sheets to make a rope ladder
30247,well thats a pretty tall order doctor
30248,silver jubilee were in the wrong time zone
30249,lethbridge stewart have you informed the headmaster then do so at once matron turlough has disappeared
30250,what turlough
30251,dont want to miss the tardis do we ive just realised the doctor is expecting the tardis to follow him through to 1983 dont you see the wounded thing in the capsule maybe it isnt the doctor after all come on
30252,then who is or do i mean who was
30253,brigadier lethbridge stewart of course come on
30254,and tegan and the other girl think or rather thought it was you
30255,no doctor
30256,you mustnt make me remember
30257,even if i wanted to i simply couldnt recall it
30258,good heavens do you think so
30259,what will that do
30260,so the warp ellipse will absorb the time differential
30261,do we have any real choice we must give him the benefit of the doubt in case he is the doctor
30262,thats not an unreasonable question
30263,i dont know doctor i think its the communication system
30264,i cant remember does it really matter
30265,oh thats ridiculous
30266,what do you mean that i could be two people
30267,doctor
30268,if its any use to you doctor i recall now that i didnt board the tardis in 1977 i was standing near the transmitter and i remember it dematerialising
30269,youre trapped on earth
30270,a sort of homing device
30271,i have such an object tegan gave it to me
30272,the homing device
30273,you never know when something like thats going to come in useful
30274,back at the hut

30298,what more do you want of me  guardian
30299,yes doctor but time itself has punished us for that crime
30300,endless torment
30301,so horrible that the elders of our planet exiled us to this ship

30303,i knew you werent the doctor  brig 83
30304,theyre immortal
30305,help us
30306,give us the energy of a time lord help us to die
30307,doctor why cant you help them
30308,so
30309,they want your remaining regenerations
30310,is that possible
30311,we did not know that our experiments would bring endless mutation
30312,you cannot refuse
30313,what does he mean
30314,my friends do not despair the doctor will soon return and of his own free will
30315,he must be here somewhere

30334,quickly
30335,its no good doctor
30336,stop stop
30337,doctor

30381,then im asking you will you take us off this ship
30382,all decks stand by all decks stand by this is a special announcement from terminus incorporated
30383,lazars
30384,i thought they were going to attack us
30385,he ran leave him
30386,this place is a death trap
30387,it was a big liner from a rich sector it looked like the perfect target so we thought
30388,hurry doctor i want to get off this ship as soon as possible
30389,what precisely are you looking for
30390,whats that in the middle
30391,im sure shell understand
30392,please we need his help
30393,my sister died of it
30394,yes they supposedly offer a cure but ive never met anyone who came back
30395,they just play on irrational fear just like the old plagues they terrified people and this is no different it isnt something you admit to
30396,an expanded chart of the universe
30397,no not that i recall
30398,what
30399,its vast
30400,whats happening
30401,attention preparations for departure will begin with stage one sterilisation unprotected personnel are advised to leave this liner immediately no return will be permitted this warning is final stage one sterilisation is now commencing
30402,only my pride damaged
30403,there must be a radiation leak
30404,doctor
30405,what is it
30406,now where
30407,you realise that nyssa and olvir could have found the tardis by now
30408,i dont know they were probably
30409,now its your turn only you im going to kill
30410,is it a machine
30411,my power packs dead
30412,its always the same pattern
30413,it seems valgards mission was unnecessary after all come on well apprehend this one ourselves
30414,it could be part of the cure
30415,they may not know how to
30416,what
30417,who is it
30418,no
30419,hmm strange isnt it
30420,thank you most kind most kind my name is er bor i havent we met somewhere before
30421,do you know anything about engines
30422,i tried to pull down the control cables i picked the wrong ones power lines as i couldnt stop the radiation i had to try and wall it in now things are even worse
30423,the whole lots unstable know what would happen if one of those exploded itd be more than just a loud bang
30424,did i tell you one of the engines has already exploded
30425,whats that
30426,olvir
30427,this is a complete waste of time bor doesnt know what hes talking about hes suffering from radiation sickness
30428,does it matter
30429,remember when we were underneath the floor well i noticed something familiar its only just come to me what it was come on
30430,olvir
30431,did he
30432,so
30433,what are you getting at
30434,jettison it
30435,and it exploded
30436,how big
30437,the big bang
30438,it isnt possible
30439,but exploding fuel in space its almost too simple
30440,well if what youre saying is right why wasnt terminus destroyed in the explosion
30441,killing the pilot and damaging the second engine
30442,if there was a second explosion would it have the same effect as the jettisoned fuel
30443,whats happening
30444,what
30445,do you know how
30446,why wont it move
30447,how can this ship still be operational after all this time
30448,he must have had the strength of a giant
30449,of course
30450,but will there still be enough time
30451,it really isnt worth the trouble you know
30452,call him
30453,and if he wont cooperate
30454,who took it who took the signal box someone will suffer for this
30455,is this necessary
30456,and if i fail
30457,nothings happening
30458,its working
30459,have i served you well
30460,do something for me destroy the box set me free

30463,happy this is terminus no ones happy here staying alive is all that counts
30464,freeze
30465,im fine doctor ive made a fantastic discovery the cure for lazar disease works
30466,the system is far from safe
30467,with the garms help yes its only his lack of free will which has prevented him from doing anything about it
30468,come in
30469,you know anybody harder to convince
30470,wait
30471,its crude stuff probably organic
30472,pleased to see me i want you to meet some people

30564,excuse me sir
30565,underwater gear like scuba divers wear
30566,it looks like the position of marker buoys
30567,electronics on an edwardian racing yacht
30568,the crew are real enough
30569,androids
30570,have to hurry
30571,for you maybe

30573,planet
30574,remarkable these are planets
30575,well that explains where they got their crew from
30576,and you
30577,marker buoy
30578,our first obstacle
30579,i intend to win this race and critas the greek is the only captain who could possibly beat me
30580,there is no point to the race if it isnt
30581,youre very observant
30582,the race as a diversion
30583,they are ephemerals
30584,beings like yourself
30585,you are not an ephemeral you are a time dweller you travel in time
30586,you are a time lord a lord of time are there lords in such a small domain
30587,a point and a half to starboard helmsman
30588,hold her on course well cut it as fine as we can
30589,man the topsail
30590,staysail inner jib and mainsail if we strip her any more she wont steer
30591,whats happening
30592,how
30593,we must have entered the gravitational pull of the planet why didnt we crash
30594,we are determined to be first
30595,doctor this is madness
30596,is that all you can say a ship and its crew has just been destroyed
30597,ive never seen a ship break up like that was it gravitational pull
30598,what
30599,sabotage
30600,but what whats the prize
30601,you dont think
30602,no one on this ship is responsible for the destruction of the greek
30603,i dont know although sabotage is not against the rules of the race it is simply less diverting
30604,to go beyond we must remain within those limits we have chosen for ourselves
30605,yes
30606,they were selected from the relevant period of earth history
30607,human
30608,we are eternals you presume to think we depend upon the ephemeral mind with all our power our technology
30609,correct
30610,as diversions
30611,it is true that ephemerals dwellers in time do have a certain entertainment value
30612,to me they are
30613,where are you going
30614,to miss tegans cabin
30615,go away  doctor
30616,this this room
30617,shows the state my minds in
30618,are they like time lords
30619,how
30620,so what makes them tick
30621,weve got to get away from here
30622,i must go back to the tardis i cant cope with marriner
30623,what do we do
30624,i wont be able to do that please take me back to the tardis
30625,i wont be happy until im back in that console room again

30627,i think so
30628,hes right
30629,where is it
30630,oh no it cant have just disappeared
30631,please doctor resistance is futile we mean her no harm
30632,you helped me such was your concern i could recall your mind as far away as the cabin the picture was as clear as if you were standing here
30633,of your ship the tardis i believe you call her adrenaline is a most effective energy boost your own fear gave her to us
30634,theres no need to look at me like that they knew about it you heard so i didnt give him away
30635,for entertaining us superior beings do not punish inferiors
30636,on deck you will have an interesting view of our competitors it may help you to decide which one is the saboteur
30637,enlightenment
30638,will we ever get off this ship
30639,are you sure doctor we will get off
30640,i will never serve you again
30641,whats happened

30670,please
30671,mister marriner my friend
30672,the vacuum shield
30673,i thought i was going to die explode in the vacuum of space
30674,wrack she said this place contains the secret of her power
30675,why can the room be open to space
30676,what is it
30677,what
30678,its an eye
30679,is that what she used to destroy the other ships
30680,so thats the secret of her power
30681,what do you mean
30682,how big would this point of focus have to be
30683,what are you talking about
30684,the first ship to be destroyed
30685,she did a sword and it had a crystal on the hilt
30686,will she try the same thing with striker
30687,luckily for us
30688,perfect
30689,do we have to stay here
30690,what do you want to do
30691,why
30692,let me stay or dont you trust me yet
30693,but the other ships you cant stop all of them

30696,you cant let them keep him
30697,why
30698,you believe that
30699,i too must change and go back to the wheelhouse were nearly into the final leg

30701,well show her a clean pair of heels
30702,look captain
30703,what are moonrakers
30704,they can overtake us
30705,wracks ship is level but were holding her
30706,then why arent they
30707,still holding level
30708,now open that door
30709,thats everything weve got
30710,more sail bosun
30711,what
30712,no
30713,what
30714,what power
30715,what would the focus look like
30716,so thats why wrack took you to the wheelhouse
30717,fascinating for an ephemeral to outwit an eternal i would have thought it an impossibility
30718,then why didnt you
30719,then we are beaten
30720,him
30721,will the tardis still function the console blew up
30722,miss tegan stays with me
30723,wrack is completely outstripping us
30724,she has almost won
30725,you have no time left throw him into the void
30726,others will recharge them for me    black guardian
30727,you lie

30729,doctor i thought you
30730,doctor

30841,a weapon used by the invaders of xeriphas a decoy capable of infinite form or personality
30842,well said my demon we are a complex mass of artificial neurons

30964,but tegan
30965,you go as well doctor
30966,theres no point in us both dying
30967,no wait

30970,what did you do to it
30971,its blinded
30972,what do we do if the myrka breaks in doctor
30973,you said yourself its practically indestructible
30974,have them try
30975,i ordered that bulkhead to be kept closed
30976,commander the seals are about to blow
30977,when i want your help ill ask for it
30978,i should have you shot
30979,all right but i cant spare you any help

30988,maddox must finish what he has started
30989,can you be sure
30990,ready now
30991,doctor solow
30992,the outcome is certain the ape primitives are no match for my warriors they will be crushed
30993,hes defending airlock five with bulic doctor ive decided to take your advice im contacting sea base command
30994,it killed doctor solow we found this by the body
30995,check the damage to the other computers
30996,switch it on
30997,switch it on
30998,is it dead
30999,your weapons please
31000,and you control earth
31001,dont take it so hard commander like you we were only doing our duty
31002,the power bloc opposed to this sea base
31003,i know what im doing doctor
31004,missiles they cant fire maddox has irreversibly rigged the computers to that effect
31005,im sorry
31006,stay where you are you were very foolish to follow me doctor
31007,ill take that risk
31008,goodbye doctor
31009,your turn
31010,perfect
31011,you know him
31012,remove these people from the bridge
31013,you are mistaken take him away
31014,the doctor you can prove what you say
31015,so it is you
31016,i will listen to what you say but i should tell you that the silurians have long since abandoned the way of mediation
31017,defensive war doctor there is a distinction silurian law forbids any other
31018,our policy has always been peaceful survival all that has changed is the means by which it can be achieved
31019,you forget twice we offered the hand of friendship to these apedescended primitives and twice we were treacherously attacked our people slaughtered it will not happen again
31020,there is doctor a final solution
31021,we will harm no one these ape primitives will destroy themselves we doctor will merely provide the pretext
31022,your hand scan commander i will not ask again
31023,no
31024,those missiles will never leave their pads not without a sync operator to complete the firing sequence
31025,a sync operator is our insurance against unauthorised launch
31026,excellent
31027,yes
31028,the silurians and sea devils will survive
31029,not quite doctor still safely hidden away in deep hibernation is the true life force of this planet when restored our civilisation will rule the earth once more
31030,come on
31031,we bear you no malice doctor once we have finished here you and your companions will be released
31032,they will die an act of mercy since there will be nobody for them to rejoin commander you will please join me at the master console
31033,yes and hed better hurry it cant be long before they discover weve escaped
31034,yes
31035,but arent we going to get the commander out
31036,well we must at least try
31037,where are we going
31038,or your friends either way shouldnt we help them
31039,doctor
31040,where were you going
31041,what are we looking for
31042,do you know what the silurians want
31043,what happened
31044,then use it on the invaders
31045,why not theyre about to start a war that will destroy everyone on earth
31046,that doesnt alter what theyre about to do
31047,whats the alternative
31048,doctor
31049,you must decide doctor billions of people could die
31050,it is too late for pity it is much too late
31051,will it be fast enough
31052,youve tried that already
31053,increase power tarpok it seems that your computers are as stubborn as you are commander
31054,weve gone to yellow alert
31055,shes dead
31056,well dont let her death count for nothing
31057,doctor youll need some help
31058,now do you believe me commander
31059,disarm them youre just in time to witness the missile launch doctor
31060,look its hexachromite gas
31061,there are millions more ready to replace us
31062,you talk in vain doctor kill them kill them
31063,commence ignition scibus
31064,less than three minutes
31065,well a phased electrical charge aimed directly at the ignition circuit it restores the launch to simulation
31066,its impossible only a sync operator can do it and maddox is dead
31067,but the computer would burn out your mind in seconds
31068,doctor try to disconnect the computer first
31069,hes right were already on final countdown to ignition
31070,the commander wasnt so lucky im afraid hes been shot
31071,theyre all dead you know
31072,is that any better
31073,is there a problem we are going to earth
31074,were nearly there
31075,weve hit an energy field
31076,hold on theres somebody out there
31077,doctor
31078,were not i checked the time monitor it is 1984
31079,well if he can move that quickly he cant be hurt very badly

31227,what is
31228,in the great what doctor
31229,fleeing from the imminence of a catastrophic collision with the sun a group of refugees from the doomed planet earth
31230,you mean some of the last humans are on this planet

31238,in here over here
31239,we shall need the emergency supplies
31240,oh thank you sir
31241,antiseptic
31242,look im the chief science officer who are you
31243,these are a terrible fire hazard in this sort of container you know
31244,well its electron excitation if you give them a shake they get a bit brighter
31245,yes im afraid it is
31246,doctor you did say

31254,well that has yet to be determined as you can see were helpless
31255,oh hello my name is range im the chief
31256,it used to generate a basic form of energy but we no longer have any fuel this planet is without wood or any combustible material
31257,oh systems that could rebuild a civilisation for us failureproof technology
31258,doctor doctor somethings happened to the tardis
31259,it couldnt be the impact of landing could it
31260,im trying to tell you its behind
31261,you told me not to do that
31262,doctor the tardis
31263,well captain revere assumed that the barrage was some sort of softening up process heralding an invasion he said
31264,frontios was quite deserted when we arrived
31265,no the few that survived the crash had no time for anything but bare survival we worked to raise food
31266,oh there was no bombardment then we had ten years of clear skies to stock the wreck of the colony ship with food and then it began yes the first missile a little over thirty years ago
31267,no theres another way in this way
31268,do you feel free to come and go as you please
31269,i see you landed during the bombardment and yet you appear unharmed
31270,and what do you think now
31271,i did not ask
31272,who are you to give me advice i am the son of captain revere the people of frontios will not be cowed by these mewling words of defeat doctor we may lack the outward appurtenances of might but we carry our strength within us we will win the war with the invisible aggressors whose missiles batter on our planet and we will win the greater battle the struggle for the future of our race
31273,the hydrazine engine this invader has interfered with the great gift my father bestowed upon the people of frontios
31274,no craft the size of yours is capable of traversing the universe
31275,another bombardment
31276,i say treachery mister range are you guilty too
31277,come on
31278,dont be alarmed we havent heard from the warnsman yet
31279,take him to the medical shelter
31280,the battery for the lighting
31281,doctor cant we continue this conversation under cover
31282,gentle with that now gentle over there
31283,are you hurt
31284,its gone
31285,im afraid it has
31286,get out of the way
31287,get on with it
31288,well doctor can you enlighten us as to the reason for these bombardments
31289,no
31290,what was that
31291,now at last the colonists of frontios are face to face with their persecutors for my fathers sake doctor i should like that question answered
31292,you deny youre at war with us
31293,without instruments its impossible to tell which one
31294,the research room was sealed up by the orders of the late captain revere
31295,thats not true its full of invaluable equipment
31296,its where we found the battery
31297,hurry up
31298,i do
31299,i wouldnt what did i do
31300,rabbits
31301,so he was hit
31302,theres something going on here isnt there some racket youre into
31303,what about them
31304,ive only just put them up
31305,yes im beginning to know the feeling
31306,its his heart the doctors going to get it going again
31307,ready
31308,yes but some of the dates are recent you told me that quarry had been closed for years
31309,you saved my life is this true
31310,exactly these floor plate are solid metal heavy solid metal norna come here we are about to find out where captain revere got his rock collection that hook goes in here       plantagenet
31311,the colony ship no i must stay here with my people
31312,lets take a look
31313,why do they come so frequently now
31314,thank you doctor
31315,your assistant may stay here with me that way well all trust one another
31316,yes of course
31317,no its just like something i remember
31318,meteorites in such quantities
31319,surely captain revere could have detected that
31320,it sounds like a title deaths unaccountable you cant do that to mister ranges records
31321,the systems failed
31322,yes without the failure there would have been no crash the guidance systems everything all went together
31323,theyve gone exploring by the look of it
31324,im afraid they may be in danger down there
31325,no not that ive suspected for a long time that captain revere ordered the quarry closed because of something he found
31326,are you sure doctor i want to help
31327,doctor are you there
31328,its my daughter doctor i cant let you take all the risk
31329,i cant hear anything
31330,i heard that
31331,tractators ive seen them
31332,what happened in there please tell me is my daughter safe
31333,are you all right
31334,but
31335,no
31336,dont tell me youre lost doctor because if you are so am i
31337,hold on doctor ill give you a hand
31338,its all right doctor ive got you whats happening
31339,why dont you do something
31340,what are you going to do
31341,is that what theyre saying
31342,if only we knew more about these creatures
31343,i heard you the first time
31344,whats it doing
31345,and youre out of order mister range if theres a grain of truth in this story of yours then these are important matters of state do you expect me to delay the investigation just because this young man is feeling delicate your names turlough eh well now turlough i want to hear all about this
31346,oh come on doctor all these tunnels look the same
31347,just loose chippings
31348,they have machines
31349,i have mister range come with me i want to show you something
31350,i dont want to be at a or b thank you very much i just want to be out of these tunnels and back in the
31351,what is it
31352,bye father
31353,this is ridiculous running about like rabbits in a hole if you ask me
31354,wait a minute
31355,thats horrible its a corpse
31356,that face i recognise it from somewhere
31357,two specimens have come down to us from the world above in an undamaged state this is a rare pleasure
31358,we know you doctor at least by reputation
31359,this is our centre of operations you see doctor i do not fear you will take this information back to gallifrey you will never leave frontios now
31360,not any more
31361,we have been marooned out here on frontios for nearly five hundred years as im sure the time lords already know
31362,youre practically telling him to carry on as is
31363,you cant side with them they built the excavating machine
31364,doctor you cant let them do this to me
31365,not at all doctor
31366,the guard tractator here will restrain it while i show you more of our work here it is certainly a very convincing replica of the humanoid life form
31367,once mind functions are extinct the entity is no longer useful as a motive force
31368,we will now demonstrate how the drive mechanism is installed
31369,why doctor
31370,if it werent for the bombardment
31371,the existence of a heavy asteroid belt in the veruna system was fortuitous but the rest doctor has been our gravitational engineering
31372,i curse the unhappy chance that brought us to this planet
31373,you
31374,but at the beginning there was no bombardment
31375,we are almost ready doctor i shall demonstrate the final adjustment
31376,i dont believe you
31377,yes but when will the time come  gravis
31378,let us show you how we smooth our walls doctor
31379,youre getting ahead of yourself doctor we will have to know one another much better before i can discuss that stage of our plans
31380,possibly
31381,yes when the tunnel system is complete and the work is nearly done
31382,how do we get him out of this doctor
31383,is he dead
31384,turlough turlough
31385,get out of here sir while theres time
31386,doctor i remember everything i must tell you
31387,and i know what theyre trying to do
31388,the excavating machine its going berserk
31389,no sign of them
31390,the tunnel system is a gigantic ring smooth and mathematically precise
31391,thats what they do to planets theyre going to drive frontios
31392,to steal and plunder wherever they go
31393,thats the orderly
31394,perhaps i have been deceived i think we have found our new driver
31395,doctor there you are
31396,well it had better work because theyre right outside
31397,turlough has remembered the secret of the tractators
31398,thats the idea
31399,or
31400,we have you completely in our control now
31401,there is nothing to negotiate
31402,you admit you were sent
31403,primitive
31404,the the tardis
31405,i should like to see it this tardis
31406,the power of travel is beautiful doctor very beautiful
31407,but i do want it doctor the tardis infinite travel within my grasp
31408,i will have it
31409,whats he doing doctor
31410,doctor what have you done
31411,the tardis cant stand this doctor
31412,thats impossible
31413,the tardis will be repaired
31414,well be in our own dimension
31415,is he dead
31416,we cant go dragging around the universe with a dormant gravis on the console
31417,not unless you count the tardis
31418,so the last of mankind is after all quite alone
31419,frontios is honoured doctor but surely youll stay a while longer and enjoy some of the new colony were building
31420,but doctor youve done so much for us
31421,dont mention it to anyone
31422,well the tardis engines would be working properly for one thing
31423,were going far too fast doctor stop the engines
31424,the gravis
31425,against what
31426,are you all right
31427,is there anything you can do
31428,that too
31429,is that true

31472,are you all right lad
31473,i was terrified it was a dalek
31474,hes still alive
31475,this is a waste of time the mutant could have escaped using the time corridor
31476,we dont know for certain
31477,whats it look like
31478,it isnt here we havent found the entrance to the time corridor either
31479,what is it
31480,is it dead
31481,what happened
31482,of course
31483,im not going back there theyll kill me
31484,help huh you dont know how much of a coward i am

31486,what
31487,im going mad daleks time corridors now this
31488,this warehouse is under martial law attempt to leave and ill have the pair of you shot
31489,ill come with you
31490,i obey
31491,no doctor
31492,you must not touch the equipment
31493,it is unwise to provoke the daleks doctor
31494,you only invite trouble with your questions
31495,oh yes the daleks are very capable of devising painful and undignified ways of dying
31496,right
31497,he is otherwise detained
31498,build a barricade something we can use for protection now theres nothing to lose lets see what i can make out of you
31499,that does not concern you
31500,you will remain silent
31501,the daleks are the superior being we do not require assistance
31502,it was but one trap
31503,stien is but an extension of dalek technology
31504,he is a duplicate he is a product of our genetic engineering
31505,yes
31506,i think im making progress
31507,yes
31508,no
31509,she is our prisoner
31510,show him
31511,the doctor without his companions would be rather incongruous
31512,your duplicates will return to gallifrey where at our command you will assassinate the members of the high council
31513,the prisoner is secured you must proceed alone we have been summoned to other duties
31514,when it is time to die you will in your agony beg to pay homage to the daleks  you will wait outside
31515,i warned you not to provoke them you only make it worse for yourself

31525,you dont understand under the dalek influence i could kill you
31526,come on move over there
31527,doctor look we should get out of here
31528,lytton grows too arrogant his mind resists our control he must be exterminated as soon as it is convenient to the daleks

31540,listen to me you in your way are not an unambitious man like me you are a renegade
31541,my mistake was making them totally ruthless it restricted their ability to cope with creatures who rely not only on logic but instinct and intuition that is a factor i wish to correct
31542,they will learn to recognise the strength that can be drawn from such an emotion
31543,to make them a more positive force
31544,the universe is at war doctor name one planet whose history is not littered with atrocities and ambition for empire it is a universal way of life

31614,i thought if i learnt how to manipulate it i could control the volcano
31615,doctor we accept your offer of help
31616,doctor your ship would there be a shining light the sound of a great wind
31617,doctor this is our leader malkon
31618,youre welcome to sarn
31619,you will hear out the doctor
31620,it has happened before but do you have knowledge that will help us
31621,malkon speaks the truth timanov says theyre gifts of logar
31622,what is transceiver unit
31623,contact trion and you ruin everything
31624,there are more like this show me
31625,doctor
31626,doctor timanov has returned

31628,you must be the doctor it is the outsiders wish that you go to the fire
31629,no
31630,wretched citizens of sarn you turned your backs on the lord of the fire mountain and listened to his enemy
31631,not yet burn the others first

31640,kill him
31641,no let logar decide let the fire god send us a sign
31642,i dont believe it
31643,the more you attack it the more it looks like the outsider
31644,obey the shining one
31645,what went wrong
31646,no
31647,no let me go
31648,who did this

31650,you dont understand doctor
31651,beneath that rubble lies an object of incomparable value a gift from logar
31652,the last trion ship to come here crashed and malkon was the only survivor it must have been the ship my father was on
31653,just accept for the moment doctor that i know he would have been the only infant on board

31659,he certainly went to a great deal of trouble to get him back do you think hes into another regeneration crisis
31660,too late
31661,but infinitely superior as i am to that galactic philanthropist
31662,there we are
31663,oh no
31664,i dont understand
31665,what anywhere
31666,the same will happen to you my dear if you obstruct me

31668,we will be guided by you chosen one
31669,sorry doctor there was nowhere else i could bring them
31670,this is the doctor hes not an enemy of logar but an elder from the city of gallifrey
31671,logar is the friend of all people whether they believe in him or not hes only angry when the citizens fight amongst themselves  its a man in a thermal suit
31672,yes once when i was a boy
31673,when i returned from the mountain my body and my mind felt stronger and fitter
31674,stop mewling
31675,we must gaze upon it
31676,the master must have precipitated an eruption

31777,you have heard of death under the red cloth
31778,it is a military procedure after death your bodies are taken to the field cremation unit your ashes are wrapped in the red cloth of execution and will be disposed of according to your directions

31795,oh and in case you lunkheads get any other ideas theres something i havent told you that ship weve got out there on autohold it wont take an order without a release code so if you guys want to see major again youd better make pretty certain nothing ever happens to me
31796,cramp
31797,working up an appetite salateen is bringing your food shortly
31798,and the stimulus of a mind nearly equal to my own
31799,ive missed so much of life these last lonely years but your arrival has changed all that we shall become the best of companions
31800,dont mock me doctor beauty i must have but you are dispensable
31801,nobody lives forever
31802,spectrox is the key to eternal youth holding at bay the ravages of time the flower of your beauty will be as permanent as a precious jewel untarnished by the passing centuries
31803,and its mine all of it
31804,knowing what theyre doing and stopping them are two different things
31805,the green area is held by the army
31806,already to get that far it has taken chellak six months and hundreds of casualties computing that rate of advance it will be another five years before im seriously threatened
31807,hes mad doctor utterly mad
31808,why do you think he hates morgus so much
31809,i know who you are
31810,why

31819,im sorry i dont suppose you see the funny side of it
31820,deposits left by the bat colonies raw spectrox contains a chemical similar to mustard nitrogen its deadly to humans so they use the androids to collect the stuff and take it to the refinery
31821,there is it was discovered years ago by professor jackij
31822,well for a start theres no oxygen down there
31823,i cant keep this line open ill meet you shaft twenty six yellow level in one hour

31826,congratulations doctor youre very close you understand something of android engineering
31827,in that case you will appreciate what a masterpiece my facsimile of salateen is the perfect android
31828,well i have to negotiate with my arms suppliers they want full payment in spectrox i shall offer them half
31829,your sense of humour will be the death of you doctor probably quite soon
31830,youre wise even i cant bear to see or touch myself i who was once once comely who was always a lover of beauty and now i have to live in this exile i have to live amongst androids because androids do not see as we see
31831,scalded near to death the flesh boiled hanging from the bone but i lived i lived so that one day i could revenge myself on that inhuman monster and i shall
31832,ive heard the story fifty times morgus supplied faulty detection instruments so the mud burst caught jek by surprise he didnt have time to get the barriers down
31833,well how can we with an android guard outside
31834,satisfied
31835,dont try it doctor
31836,shush

31838,where are you going
31839,i told you theres no oxygen down there
31840,weve got these protective belt buckles havent we i think sharaz jek has fouled up in a big way this time
31841,let me go
31842,whoever you are come out doctor i hadnt expected to see you again so soon
31843,how is it that you were able to walk past my androids
31844,when i ask a question i do not expect flippancy wheres the girl wheres peri
31845,tear his arms out slowly you know the power an android can exert doctor after your arms they will remove your legs now wheres the girl
31846,you cant protect her i shall tear the truth out of you
31847,salateen in that case theyve probably reached the army camp release him
31848,come on keep moving you
31849,my ship right on time so hurry it up

31871,its here two hundred metres down but youll collapse before you get there
31872,doctor wait i have just one oxygen cylinder left i used it when i went into the baking chambers of the refinery it will run out in minutes but it might help

32135,you think that i would be so vulnerable youre an interfering fool
32136,you might just reach that gun before i can kill you but i doubt it
32137,it does not concern you
32138,a small setback time lord
32139,he has tried to kill me he must therefore forfeit his own existence
32140,not quite time lord
32141,i tire of the disadvantages of my own being
32142,so i intend to take over your mind as well as your body
32143,but he can do it

32149,the one thing that you cannot control i am dying i am regenerating
32150,i had no other choice
32151,dear friend you are too unstable he would have swamped you you would have been the pebble drowning in his lake
32152,oh it was nearly at an end anyway
32153,my only regret is leaving jaconda gave me a good life many great moments one of the best my friend was that time by the fountain
32154,i said shut up
32155,dont ever do that again

32158,youre a true gentleman sir
32159,yes thats right sir
32160,oh but sir i must get away from here
32161,what about the rest of the people on this planet

32166,did you have to be so rude
32167,are you having another of your fits
32168,then i suggest you take a crash course in manners
32169,your former self was polite enough
32170,we all have to repress our feelings from time to time i suggest you get back into the habit
32171,well i hope so
32172,no we are in the right tunnel david david david you all right david
32173,what are you doing
32174,what
32175,i see
32176,well what i really mean to say is you still seem a little unstable
32177,oh dear
32178,and a very loud voice
32179,i still think youre doing too much you need to rest
32180,well
32181,yes doctor
32182,doctor whats happening
32183,im being
32184,jobs today well i dont know hes playing everything so close theres seven kilos of plastic look dont argue just have the stuff ready im on my way in
32185,well i hope you never do anything more serious i think my heart is where my liver should be
32186,big deal
32187,im grateful im grateful just tell me where we are if you can
32188,whats that
32189,its very pretty but it still doesnt tell me where we are
32190,bit of an anticlimax after that journey
32191,well what do you expect applause
32192,no more deathdefying rides
32193,dont you think we should land
32194,i only hope the tardis knows it look doctor out there are thousands millions of tons of ice one illconsidered move could cause us to collide with it im scared doctor you dont seem to understand that
32195,i hope not its rather ironic on earth halleys comet is always associated with impending disaster
32196,does that noise have anything to do with you
32197,how do you know
32198,wheres it coming from
32199,whats all that other noise
32200,thats not possible
32201,this time its for swinging not leaning on
32202,where are we
32203,i didnt mean that i meant whereabouts on earth are we
32204,it didnt change
32205,i thought you said it was going to blend into its surroundings
32206,oh neat doctor
32207,very neat i mean theres nothing at all incongruous about that
32208,im not surprised in that coat
32209,look doctor since you regenerated its as though your memorys been put through the meat grinder i mean its all there but in a pile of unrelated bits and pieces
32210,its true though in the past couple of days youve called me tegan zoe susan on one occasion you even referred to me as jamie
32211,i rather think theyre slips of the mind and while were about it who is this terrible zodin
32212,thanks a lot
32213,now where
32214,are you sure this is the right place
32215,what
32216,this way
32217,peri yeah well supposing there really are aliens here on earth i mean does it really matter i mean they dont all have ten heads and want to take over the world
32218,thats if you can find the entrance how do we get in
32219,well there still is a way in
32220,i thought you said it was in the house
32221,i dont understand
32222,giving him plenty of time to move on
32223,otherwise how would the alien know someone had discovered his main transmitter
32224,i hope this alien appreciates what were doing
32225,im not saying a word
32226,doctor
32227,doctor
32228,hes got a gun
32229,never do such a stupid thing again i could have killed you
32230,dont patronise me
32231,what happened to the other one
32232,im assuming these arent the real police
32233,but why did they try to kill us
32234,i only hope this is the right direction
32235,they could have been made at any time
32236,to think this is my first visit to london
32237,im sure its fascinating itd be nice to see the sights like a regular tourist
32238,doctor you said it was gunfire
32239,doctor
32240,well what did we hear this hasnt been fired we must fetch the police
32241,look doctor this isnt some deserted planet in the middle of nowhere you dont have to play the lone ranger
32242,youve got a body here what more do you want
32243,run
32244,im sorry i didnt realise you were so scared
32245,well i was thinking too you know that man we found back there do you think the alien killed him and if he did how do you think itll respond to us
32246,i only hope it believes you
32247,over there now who are you
32248,where did you get this from
32249,oh yes i wasnt aware it was lost
32250,whats this then
32251,yeah
32252,put your hands back on the wall
32253,who are you
32254,youre bonkers
32255,yes
32256,oh they do most of the time
32257,the truth wouldnt make much sense to you
32258,for real
32259,you murder a police officer youll get thirty years
32260,im here to observe the activities of a white male suspect known as lytton
32261,its a more colourful description but it could be him
32262,dalek
32263,oh well youll be pleased to hear theres a reward
32264,well there was a whisper on the street that the job was down to lytton only wed never heard of him
32265,huh perhaps he might have when we checked there was no record of his birth school driving licence tax nothing under normal circumstances wed have just picked him up
32266,thank you
32267,where are we going
32268,they are now proving too resourceful alert the guard they must not enter cyber control alive
32269,which way
32270,what is it
32271,what are they
32272,you want to fight it
32273,what can you do with that
32274,lets go doctor please
32275,we need the army
32276,im going im going
32277,cybermen
32278,sorry
32279,there is nothing to discuss
32280,we cannot agree to bargain doctor it would be unfortunate if you were to be killed but we should still have your tardis
32281,release the woman
32282,you have my word
32283,also that of the cyber controller
32284,no merely damaged
32285,on our home planet telos
32286,no
32287,they havent a time vessel landed on telos the cybermen were able to capture it
32288,they will have two with your tardis
32289,i assume you two know each other
32290,that wasnt out of choice your regeneration has made you vindictive doctor
32291,i think he means hes also a prisoner
32292,what are you trying to do
32293,wed miss telos
32294,i would have thought griffiths even you would have managed to work that out by now telos is the cybermens home planet
32295,they had nowhere else to go
32296,but few with the facilities that telos offered
32297,what does he mean
32298,thats a strange reason to commit genocide
32299,but why did the cybermen need the cold
32300,but tell them how it was destroyed
32301,its not often i have the opportunity to watch a time lord squirm
32302,tell them when
32303,when did it happen
32304,next year thats almost now
32305,well you must do something inform earth tell them its coming i mean whats happening to us now must have something to do with that
32306,you interfere continually
32307,the time lords would have him destroyed
32308,so am i i mean how can a planet travel around off its orbit
32309,why
32310,and you will go to the console room
32311,the woman is unharmed telos is cold she must have warmer clothing i have kept my word but you have deceived us
32312,what happened
32313,you look terrible
32314,what have you done
32315,do you really want to know oh this place is so cold
32316,im pleased you two are so impressed i find the whole place hateful
32317,we have materialised in the wrong place
32318,he almost sounded concerned
32319,theyre not dead the cybermen are hibernating
32320,we must leave this place at once
32321,this way
32322,welcome
32323,shut up
32324,so did they but as you see some of us survived not many but some youre looking very blue
32325,ah i think i shall enjoy your company
32326,you are in fact the first company ive had in some time i honestly thought i would die without ever seeing another humanoid face
32327,ah escape they all talk about that for the first few minutes then they become depressed its the locked door and the armed guard thats the unsolvable problem
32328,i hate the cybermen more than you could ever know and if i could do anything to frustrate or obstruct their course i certainly would
32329,i would be happier if the cyber controller and the others were all dead
32330,oh but they cant not properly
32331,which they stole they dont fully understand the principle of time
32332,i wouldnt get too excited
32333,because what they have in mind will undoubtedly distress you
32334,they intend to change history
32335,instruct the scouts to follow and destroy the svps at once
32336,oh yes im sure
32337,it would only be necessary to disrupt it
32338,they have one a natural one in fact its heading towards earth at this very moment
32339,thats right they plan to divert it cause it to crash into earth itll make a very loud bang
32340,who knows perhaps their agents are already at work
32341,you are a time lord
32342,i want to see the cybermen dealt with as much as the time lords do
32343,of course but my people have accepted their fate your problem is to convince the cybermen of theirs i think i can help you i managed to open one of these but i couldnt do anything with it
32344,vastial its a mineral very common in the colder areas of telos its also very unstable in fact you have enough in your hand to blow it off at this temperature though its quite safe quite useless otherwise the cybermen would hardly have locked us in here with it
32345,even if you can get the door open the guard in the corridor is armed
32346,but were in here and hes out there
32347,very little
32348,of course but how will you get it out of here
32349,destroy the guard first then well discuss it
32350,there is enough explosive in here to annihilate cyber control
32351,the doctor has escaped he must be found
32352,doctor you escaped youve got to help me they want to destroy the tardis
32353,it would be more accurate to say that we do not wish the cybermen to control it
32354,we have no way of telling
32355,what are you doing
32356,but this things dead
32357,and achieve what
32358,flast but we thought she was dead
32359,excellent you will all accompany me
32360,yes
32361,please remove your tardis from telos before you have to be rescued again
32362,but doctor what about lytton
32363,hes been captured by the cybermen
32364,you dont understand hes working for the cryons
32365,well you cant just let him die
32366,in the laboratory
32367,i know you
32368,did you put the sonic lance to good use
32369,now you must kill me
32370,the drug is affecting my brain irreversible damage
32371,i did my best i kept my word
32372,emotion is a weakness
32373,it brought you back for your friend and it will cost you your life
32374,its too late doctor hes dead
32375,you must theres nothing you can do
32376,earths safe so is history and the web of time
32377,id tell em
32378,i dont believe it
32379,you sound confident i dont want to know
32380,every time you sound confident nowadays something terrible seems to happen
32381,well since we left telos youve caused three electrical fires a total power failure and a near collision with a storm of asteroids not only that youve twice managed to get yourself lost in the tardis corridors wiped the memory of the flight computer and jettisoned three quarters of the storage hold you even managed to burn dinner last night
32382,if you recall last night i was supposed to have a cold supper
32383,before each and every unfortunate accident youve said in a loud confident voice thats it and to be honest doc i am getting tired of clearing up the mess and being thrown around the tardis like the teddy bear of some psychotic baby
32384,for the moment
32385,right now the feeling isnt mutual
32386,so now what will we materialise as
32387,well better than a pyramid or nelsons column
32388,we did as a pyramid on the frozen plains of ewa nine remember
32389,youre the most inconsistent and intolerant man ive ever met
32390,then why are you shouting
32391,what
32392,still after all the work youve done
32393,oh great arent there emergency power circuits or something
32394,terrific
32395,what exactly does that mean
32396,for how long
32397,i am not afraid to die my family have served and perished at the will of the people now if it is my turn so be it
32398,where are we
32399,doctor
32400,no
32401,yes but why wont it move
32402,yes doctor but we can dont give up please
32403,me why is it okay for me
32404,here a little something to stop you sighing like a steam engine
32405,tardis manual i found it in the workshop propping open a vent
32406,hey wont that tell you whats wrong with the tardis
32407,the comparator
32408,doctor the column moved
32409,what is it
32410,is that in the hypertime ratio section
32411,er orthoganal reading is zee s plus 101 eq
32412,yes
32413,what is it
32414,doctor its working
32415,how long would that take
32416,well lets go there then
32417,artificial atmosphere enclosed underground breathable
32418,what kind of place is this doctor why did that man fire at us and then turn away as if we didnt exist
32419,hi
32420,i know how this place works i know you are but a product of my mind and i choose to resist you to know that you cannot exist
32421,control control my antihallucination switch is suffering malfunction permission to withdraw
32422,yes sure
32423,doctor careful
32424,help me whoever you are quickly
32425,like this
32426,who are you
32427,doctor
32428,theyre too close
32429,nor me
32430,an ordinary prison once but now theres a patrol car coming im sorry i thought there was an escape cell down here
32431,why should you want to help me
32432,wheres that emergency lighting
32433,no
32434,we must leave straightaway
32435,for every rondal there are thousands of varosians slumped over their wall screens deadened by overwork and starvation
32436,that stuff who wants it
32437,i like that one the one in the funny clothes
32438,the cruel thing is that there is supposed to be safe route leading towards an exit freedom
32439,is there another way to get back to his spaceship
32440,then were trapped good as dead
32441,sometimes
32442,thisll sort them out
32443,i cant
32444,oh what was that thing we saw a creature from my worst imaginings
32445,a geejee fly but it was huge
32446,no some dangers are very real the crowd loves to watch trialists face a danger they believe to be imaginary the viewers applaud and shout with laughter as we poor fools walk towards certain death
32447,almost all of varos its the way the officers divert discontent questions thoughts of revolution
32448,animal
32449,just like comtec design to put a real monster immediately beyond an imaginary one
32450,the tardis should be
32451,your ship has gone
32452,yes doctor where
32453,keep trying to open it
32454,drink doctor drink doctor drink water drink water
32455,after i extract the truth about this girl and her companion the doctor come
32456,im sorry
32457,who are you
32458,ive seen you on the screens youve returned from the dead
32459,i should think something might be arranged lets have a little word with the executioners theyre always on the lookout for fresh material
32460,er not taken seriously for the rubbish they may have spoken earlier on
32461,four nooses
32462,a spare theyre very thorough
32463,plenty of other prisoners the authorities would be happy to rid themselves of
32464,areta is my wife they condemned her too
32465,its the same thing
32466,your appeal has been turned down im sorry
32467,doctor im sorry ive tried everything they just wont believe the truth
32468,enlighten us as to the truth about your visit please doctor
32469,anything to add doctor anything which might persuade me to halt the sequence of events
32470,well
32471,the delegate from the galatron mining corporation is here to negotiate our yearly review of market price for the ore of varos
32472,yes
32473,is that all you wish to know
32474,i trust you are unharmed doctor
32475,as a means of eliciting true information it has often been successful you suspected our bluff
32476,ah yes what i have to discover now is the truth of your statements made from the scaffold
32477,perhaps ill keep them in my dome as prettypretty pets
32478,theres a problem
32479,we were unable to reverse the transmutation of your lovely ladies
32480,ill kill him
32481,its probably too late
32482,it is an unstable process even i am not quite certain as to how it works exactly
32483,its an offshoot of our mining research technology we found our miners growing fur and claws the better they thought to dig with
32484,who knows we dont require such findings here
32485,certainly which is why this trial must continue an experiment like this has never been so advanced or so successful before
32486,i am section controller a permanent position no one orders me certainly not a transient governor in the twilight of his reign
32487,the regulations hand it to the officer guard by long tradition
32488,no one has the nerve or the will to wrest it from me mister governor sir
32489,not any more why
32490,yes why do you ask how do you know
32491,hold it
32492,doctor can you decide which
32493,on the other side of the dome but to reach it from here is impossible
32494,what leave them here
32495,areta areta
32496,peri
32497,peri
32498,wake up areta come on
32499,i thought i could fly
32500,doctor
32501,its no good
32502,i dont know
32503,i think were into what they call the endgame not many trialists reach this stage
32504,presumably
32505,come on then
32506,what did he die from
32507,fellow prisoners
32508,what shall we do
32509,what do they want why do they want us
32510,what do we do
32511,i see you have a keen interest in the flora of varos doctor
32512,and deprive varos of an example of how traitors are dealt with the cameras are still functioning let the show begin i want to hear them scream till i am deaf with pleasure to see their limbs twist in excruciating agony ultimately their blood must gush and flow along the gutters of varos the whole planet must delight in their torture and death
32513,proceed
32514,what is it
32515,poison ivy
32516,ah there you are i called you here to inform you that a force of invasion is about to land
32517,argh
32518,twenty twenty argh
32519,like cyanide
32520,what about that transmogrifier thing he put me in
32521,im very grateful doctor varos is grateful is there nothing we can offer you in return
32522,you shall have as much as you need maldak will arrange it
32523,you cant leave me here
32524,dunno
32525,doctor youre sure the tardis will function properly
32526,you think im crazy
32527,apart from the residual side effects of fowl pest i feel fine
32528,hey doctor this is great
32529,large
32530,spare me the lecture please okay what do you reckon okay for the royal open day at kew gardens
32531,oh stay there will you ive hardly got the energy to wash  then gas starts to fill the room the men collapse the far wall slides back to reveal two figures in gas masks
32532,wisecracks like that tell me one thing
32533,you havent a clue whats going on
32534,manoeuvred off course you mean it isnt the tardis malfunctioning again
32535,well i only asked a simple question
32536,well tell me whats going on
32537,being changed
32538,who by
32539,well cant you override
32540,a time lord
32541,oh great some substitute for kew gardens
32542,what have you got there
32543,right come on
32544,i mean in the twentieth century theyre being chopped down to improve farming efficiency my generations already concerned about the effects on wildlife some species of butterfly are almost extinct birds too
32545,strange
32546,well maybe its the scarecrow
32547,here let me help why did they attack you
32548,theyre scared itll rob them of their jobs
32549,you suspect another motive
32550,odd that leaving jack ward behind theyre usually such mates

33137,well how are these baubles and crystal balls going to help us
33138,but will it work
33139,a small barricade in front of the door wouldnt help
33140,it signalled back to you
33141,but how could it be it took all of ten seconds to return
33142,you may well be right doctor
33143,where
33144,dematerialisation

33150,look this might be a lot of fun for you doctor but hows it going to help us get out of here
33151,yes but will it work
33152,excellent soon the only living creatures on this planet will be the morloxes and myself

33155,will that be your handiwork doctor
33156,holy mackerel it actually works
33157,its incredible ive never seen that before
33158,youve changed a bit
33159,its a long story herbert no time to tell it now

33172,doctor
33173,welcome doctor
33174,of morlox
33175,no
33176,ah well that can hardly be said of our beloved leader the borad of karfel the most luminous force in this part of the galaxy
33177,neither have you doctor
33178,i would guard your tongue time lord
33179,my other self
33180,precisely i was once like you weak of limb and small of mind  borad
33181,come closer now look at me carefully doctor we have met before think back of a scientist you once befriended later you reported that scientist to the inner sanctum for unethical experimentation on the morlox creatures
33182,the very same
33183,do not make me laugh doctor
33184,during an experiment on a morlox creature i was inadvertently sprayed by a canister of mustakozene eighty the smell of the chemical excited the creature i was experimenting upon and it broke away from its tether
33185,it would appear so
33186,a glorious transformation
33187,show respect for the borad
33188,not for much longer soon the bandrils will have destroyed all mammalian life on this planet and then i shall destroy the bandril ship
33189,no
33190,idiot
33191,that is under control
33192,not yet but when i do her name will be peri
33193,the creature will attempt to kill her when it tries to do so the canister of mustakozene will burst apart and then she will become as i am
33194,peri will not die the mustakozene not only excites the creature but will in turn destroy it
33195,choose your next words carefully doctor they could be your last
33196,goodbye doctor
33197,your attempted witticisms are beginning to become tedious doctor
33198,youre lying
33199,another expedition into the realms of duplicity
33200,no youve tricked me
33201,who is it
33202,doctor up here
33203,where is she
33204,right
33205,as you say doctor
33206,oh doctor am i pleased to see you
33207,but cant we get out of here
33208,its no good weve done everything we can we must take cover in the tunnels
33209,too late the bandrils have fired their missile
33210,they dont reply
33211,how close is the missile
33212,oh terrific
33213,doctor
33214,well id rather stay with you

33333,they may not tell you
33334,er well hi i dont think so were just looking
33335,i beg your pardon
33336,what you mean is the posture for perpetual instatement and for whom do you wish this service
33337,thats great thats a little like the djs on earth
33338,it seems my agents were correct kara has employed assassins
33339,perpetual instatement
33340,what was that
33341,that is not possible not without the express permission of the great healer
33342,no its all right im okay
33343,couldnt we just go back to the tardis
33344,with me as her escort she certainly shall
33345,whats it got to do with you
33346,quiet
33347,bodysnatching
33348,it was horrible it was growing just like an embryo

33361,not when there is an escape pod to be had
33362,ah there i was fortunate
33363,as for the news of stengos death it was all part of my scheme to lure you here
33364,you cannot steal what has already been abandoned no one is interested in the people here
33365,as your graverobbing friends have now been exterminated you will not hear the complaint again
33366,in anticipation of one day being returned to life
33367,all the resting ones i have used were people of status ambition they would understand especially as i have given them the opportunity to become masters of the universe
33368,i never waste a valuable commodity the humanoid form makes an excellent concentrated protein this part of the galaxy is developing quickly famine was one of its major problems
33369,a scheme that has earned me great acclaim
33370,certainly not that would have created what i believe is termed consumer resistance they were grateful for the food it allowed them to go on living
33371,doctor
33372,now doctor prepare to witness the greatest rebirth ever
33373,prepare the surgical unit such a foolish waste of energy
33374,this used to be a good place before you came i enjoyed working here once youve gone itll be a good place again

33376,you have not heard the last of me i shall return

33383,how
33384,the weed plant
33385,i have a bomb and i would like to explode it not only will it destroy davros daleks it might just catch him as well
33386,just one thing doctor theres no timing device once i press this red button pow
33387,no theres no time i want davros dead
33388,ive always wanted an honourable kill davros is to be it go now the catacombs are deep you might find a safe place
33389,come on
33390,return this to my order tell them how we died
33391,come on

33393,come on you two this is no time to chat lets get out of here
33394,what are we going to do
33395,mind you that plot for perpetual instatement would make good growing land
33396,when weve finished here can we take a real holiday
33397,cant we go somewhere fun
33398,oh great
33399,cant we come back some other time like when its not raining
33400,i dont understand why you wanted to come here in the first place
33401,hey dont i get some
33402,that is noted doctor why did you go to ravalox
33403,your crude sarcasm is also noted i should warn you doctor that your hostile attitude is not helpful
33404,i dont think i like ravalox very much it reminds me of a wet november back on earth
33405,huh
33406,so
33407,oh pity it couldnt be a dry one
33408,it doesnt look very destroyed
33409,hmm
33410,and the twittering of tiny birds and the rustling of small mammals as they forage for food in the undergrowth
33411,then youve better hearing than me there arent any birds listen
33412,none of this makes any sense any soil left after the visitation of a fireball would be sterile
33413,dont patronise me doctor you knew from the start this amount of growth wasnt possible
33414,maybe
33415,is there any intelligent life here
33416,oh here doctor look
33417,and were not going inside
33418,im just not crazy about meeting any early life forms
33419,doctor i know this sounds crazy but i have the weirdest feeling that ive been here before
33420,well possible or not i want to get away from here
33421,this place is spooky its like an overgrown fallout shelter
33422,well who lived on this planet
33423,what
33424,ive scratched myself
33425,thanks for the sympathy
33426,come here you ignorant maggot ridden peasant somehow i always feel foolish saying this take me to your leader
33427,and they wrote in english
33428,oh doctor were on earth arent we i said it felt like earth
33429,well then how do you explain this
33430,thats ridiculous
33431,whats that
33432,well what time are we in
33433,so what happened to london
33434,doctor i know it is i can feel it
33435,dont get emotional this cinder were standing on is all thats left of my world everything i knew
33436,the reason will be made clear shortly doctor
33437,where you left her
33438,shall we continue
33439,do you
33440,this is still my world whatever the period and i care about it and all you do is talk about it as though were in a planetarium
33441,i know what you mean and i still want to get away from here
33442,no ive seen enough ill wait you at the entrance where they used to sell candy bars and newspapers
33443,ow
33444,water thief water thief protect your water
33445,where are you from old one
33446,what station did you disgrace with your miserable presence water thief
33447,youll be untied as soon as were ready for the stoning
33448,water is life those who steal life must in their turn die the immortal commands it
33449,this is what ive been waiting for now immortal i am ready for you
33450,i am balazar the reader of the books
33451,ancient books from the world before the fire they contain much wisdom for those who can interpret their meaning here in marb we have three
33452,the books of knowledge
33453,one of our books is called mo by dick by herman melville it tells of a great white water god and contains many mystical passages
33454,how can you have read it old one the sacred books belong to marb
33455,the water babies by charles kingsley which tells of life long before the fire
33456,most mysterious of all the sacred texts uk habitats of the canadian goose by hm stationery office
33457,marb station
33458,we call it uk habitat ah it appears were ready for the stoning now doctor i have greatly enjoyed our felicitous discourse but alas the end is nigh
33459,it is not advisable i have taken an affection to you it is best to die quickly
33460,i think it best that you stand over here
33461,well in case some stray stone breaks the water jugs
33462,people get very excited at these stonings
33463,ready
33464,get set go
33465,im sure you were
33466,most ingenious my dear doctor
33467,what the valeyard wants and what the court decides are two entirely different things doctor
33468,it is my task to study the ancient texts
33469,it was only half over
33470,youd have been free of your troubles now if merdeen and his train guards had not saved you
33471,it was on the orders of the immortal
33472,oh yes of course
33473,so hes a freelance like myself possibly we can reach an accommodation here my boy two rogues with but a single thought
33474,since the fire
33475,i do not know doctor he was sent to save our lives many centuries ago
33476,only the young men who pass the selection
33477,to find the two cleverest youths they go to the castle
33478,it is said the immortal eats them
33479,you enter here doctor
33480,no
33481,when you are in the immortals presence you will cast your eyes to the ground
33482,it is forbidden to look upon him
33483,you will not find it wise to mock the immortal doubtless your body will be returned to me before this day is out
33484,the pyre is being built you will be brought when your time is due
33485,i have been waiting for this day welcome at last
33486,for centuries i am drathro an l3 robot
33487,you are not from andromeda then where are you from
33488,i have heard of gallifrey an advanced civilisation
33489,i apologize for my error
33490,i am not immortal
33491,these are my assistants tandrell and humker you will work with them
33492,because i command it
33493,weve not met an organic since we passed the selection
33494,explain
33495,circumstantially germane my lady in that it is part of the prosecutions case is that the doctor introduces a disruptive and corrupting influence wherever he goes
33496,if the doctor had not visited ravalox then the whole chain of events we are witnessing would not have been set in motion
33497,that is for me to decide doctor and may i remind you the charge you face is grave indeed
33498,youre puerile attempts at flippancy are not appreciated in this court doctor proceed valeyard
33499,the black light system is indicating incipient failure
33500,i am trained only in installation and maintenance
33501,i have trained these humans to study the problem but they make no progress
33502,i have a learning capacity but my processors of ratiocination are logical organics often eliminate such steps
33503,your first task will be to restructure the system
33504,what now
33505,i meant what are you protesting about this time
33506,if the accused hadnt interrupted my lady the point i wish to make would have become obvious
33507,i know depressing isnt it
33508,i order you to work
33509,you will remain here and proceed with your appointed task
33510,it was also to maintain the three sleepers until they could be returned to andromeda
33511,they are dead now the relief ships failed to arrive
33512,why
33513,a transparent ruse to escape get on with the work
33514,the condensation plants produce only enough for five hundred work units
33515,i am aware that precipitation has returned to normal
33516,my instructions were to maintain an underground survival system
33517,what is happening       broken tooth
33518,wait doctor we mean you no harm
33519,things have changed
33520,take balazar with you
33521,i must stay and help others
33522,would you help us doctor to crush the immortals power
33523,stop this is another prime example of the doctors interference you will note that he was in a position to free himself of the situation yet deliberately chose not to
33524,i think we should reserve judgement until the end of the sequence
33525,its beautiful
33526,who are they
33527,but how
33528,well now what
33529,broken tooth its balazar
33530,i too
33531,no need to hurry its gone
33532,i blew it up
33533,itll put the l3 out of action
33534,you will all return to our village our queen has unfinished business with this person
33535,valeyard are these unpleasant scenes necessary to your case i find primitive physical violence distressing
33536,i too find it repugnant to witness my lady but the doctor has a wellknown predilection for violence
33537,do not interrupt doctor
33538,please be silent
33539,doctor you will have ample opportunity to put your case at a later point
33540,and who is this
33541,another star traveller
33542,and are you interested in the great totem of haldren
33543,she means the light converter
33544,that makes you very unusual for a star traveller who is interested in the great totem
33545,then you are very prompt considering your friends have only recently damaged it
33546,then please explain
33547,interesting though i do not understand what you are saying
33548,fascinating since your friend just told me that it was a navigational beacon
33549,how shall i know who speaks the truth all i am certain of is the gods are angered at your coming to our world i shall read their wishes in the flames
33550,remain where you are
33551,thought wed seen the last of this place
33552,the queen will burn us in your place
33553,youre the time lord havent you got a ring you can rub a magic lamp something for these sort of emergencies
33554,purely a private enterprise doctor to collect a few moldering files of no value except to scholars such as myself
33555,exactly the description doctor
33556,a small expediency if i am to endow a library on my home planet of salostophus
33557,you know of it
33558,i said so didnt i
33559,thats why the lost expedition missed
33560,shut up and stand in front of me where i can keep an eye on you
33561,well cant you shake its hand or something
33562,background testimony
33563,youre allowing your disrespect to show again doctor
33564,as prosecutor the valeyard has the right to include any evidence he considers to be relevant provided he can justify its inclusion
33565,this evidence is taken from the matrix a knowledge bank fed constantly by the experiences of all time lords wherever they may be
33566,not what
33567,doctor the experience of third parties can also be monitored and accessed if needed as long as they are in the collection range of a tardis
33568,doctor
33569,im not sarah jane im peri
33570,and youre lying under the remains of a robot
33571,ive been trying to
33572,theyve gone to the tunnels
33573,from what i could hear now theyve killed the immortal shes planning a takeover
33574,a few minutes
33575,why
33576,no soon the black light system will collapse in upon itself and we shall all cease to function
33577,that sounds easy enough
33578,well what happens if he wont let you
33579,oh great so thats why were going in is it
33580,and i think that would be unfair to the defendant do you wish to lodge an official objection at this stage doctor
33581,as you wish proceed
33582,well how long before this black light thing blows up
33583,so you have returned
33584,the train is noisy we hunt by foot
33585,we should be free he wanted the glory of your capture to please the immortal
33586,ive known him all his life i asked for him to join the guards i helped him i even hoped that one day he would see there is no reason for the cullings
33587,hell kill you
33588,first he must deal with the wild ones and then if theres an explosion
33589,drathro says theres going to be an explosion
33590,there is a constant external discharge from one pole to the other
33591,round the corner keep straight turn right at what used to be oxford circus then ask again i think
33592,i did not interrupt the evidence to commend you on your athleticism doctor
33593,and may i remind you yet again that this is a serious trial
33594,you will have the opportunity in due course to rebut any or all of the valeyards charges
33595,and so it does
33596,you will apologise at once
33597,the doctor is well known for these childish outbursts i do not find the ramblings of an immature mind offensive
33598,it is that particular state of mind that has made it necessary for you to be brought before this court
33599,my pleasure inquisitor
33600,that is not in question however but for your intervention the two technological trainees humker and tandrell might have repaired the defect
33601,the immortal struck her down with a bolt of lightning
33602,we are waiting to be culled
33603,its no good doctor you can only speak to the immortal through the communication box
33604,exactly my lady
33605,that is accepted however i should like to see the last sequence again
33606,immortal you commanded me to find the doctor i have him here  drathro
33607,oh merdeen if the doctors right were all in danger anyway we might all die
33608,no you will not shut it down
33609,if the system is shut down i too cease
33610,termination point
33611,that does not matter doctor all that you see it my creation
33612,the work units exist only to serve me without me they would have no function
33613,is that abuse
33614,i am listening
33615,explain why
33616,i know of values is your point that organics are of more value than robots
33617,then why should i be in command of organics if they are of greater value
33618,merdeen youre a pal oh youre both pals now show me
33619,i have studied my work units for five centuries i understand all their responses what you would call life
33620,i understand evolution
33621,why i have said that without me they have no purpose
33622,this discussion is of no value i do not wish the work units to continue when i have ceased to function
33623,hubris
33624,go on then
33625,it is finished
33626,there will be soon
33627,it is no longer of concern to me
33628,so that was your intention doctor
33629,to distract me
33630,doctor are you all right
33631,such as what
33632,that seems eminently sensible
33633,you two over there
33634,sorry doc you heard what he said
33635,slipknot doctor the best i can do for you
33636,dont knock low cunning doctor youre still here arent you oh thats it is it the secrets my word there should be a lot there all microdots no doubt come along then dibber open the door for the immortal
33637,will that prevent an explosion
33638,which ones
33639,neons
33640,those how much time do have we got
33641,now what
33642,what about you
33643,i know strange isnt it
33644,are merdeen and peri safe
33645,oh i wish you wouldnt keep frightening me like this
33646,please dont start im too tired and too scared to cope
33647,this seems to be the end doctor as it is written in the books
33648,yes perhaps at last we shall find the habitat of the canadian goose
33649,its the other way
33650,the tardis
33651,old one hey thats cute
33652,sit down smugness does not become you doctor
33653,in due course
33654,that has been noted
33655,you showed little reluctance in complying with the request
33656,lives were lost and because of your meddling doctor
33657,without your interference it might have involved less sacrifice of human life
33658,gentlemen doctor perhaps you should heed the valeyard may i suggest that for the time being you have said enough
33659,be silent doctor
33660,thank you inquisitor
33661,finished ive barely started
33662,members of the court we have just witnessed a typical glorious escapade of the doctor
33663,and doctor the prosecuting counsels title is the valeyard not the brickyard backyard knackers yard or any other kind of yard again do i make myself clear
33664,as i was saying we have just witnessed a sequence in the doctors history which illustrated perfectly his almost gleeful pleasure in interfering in the development of alien life forms
33665,thank you sagacity
33666,an attitude i much approve
33667,doctor
33668,the box
33669,that is not relevant to this segment of evidence
33670,whoa far out are you quite sure this is the planet you aimed for
33671,in that goo no thanks
33672,its certainly an amazing one for a sea that is is that this planets moon
33673,ill just fetch my galoshes
33674,no but pink water
33675,no im more concerned i might clash with what lives in it
33676,i cant get over how weird this place is
33677,difficult to believe theres any industry here
33678,doctor
33679,are you sure that thing was made here
33680,beams that kill wasnt the only thing he had on his mind dirty old warlord glad we left that place when we did
33681,does it really matter how they blow each other to bits
33682,by us
33683,your very words condemn you doctor show your arrogance
33684,you feel only you have the right to meddle anyone else with that ambition according to you should be stopped
33685,you know ive never seen a tide go out so quickly do you think its to do with that
33686,well why would they want to control the tide
33687,sometimes i wish you hadnt
33688,doctor look
33689,no need there are clearer examples of your guilt to come
33690,that klaxons bound to attract someones attention
33691,well what is it
33692,that thing must have been brighter than it looked
33693,oh dear
33694,the raak was not programmed to attack you must have threatened him fetch a stretcher
33695,where is your submersible
33696,you are part of croziers new group
33697,there will have to be an enquiry about this death
33698,the raak was proud of his upgrading happy to be in service to the mentors
33699,take him to the dissection lab there must have been a regression theyll want to know why you will come with us we will take you to croziers laboratory when he has verified your identities you will be released
33700,glad you agree
33701,er if you dont mind
33702,oh what a pity huh
33703,old he is young for a man of science perhaps you should describe crozier for me
33704,why he is dead
33705,oh cheek
33706,he is dead
33707,like crozier
33708,are you sure thats wise
33709,more than ready doctor
33710,whats that
33711,whats that
33712,doctor there
33713,are you okay
33714,what is he
33715,but how good boy nice dog nice man can you help us were wondering if you
33716,help me
33717,we must go back he asked for help
33718,he said help me oh doctor whats going on here sea monsters upgraded to operate machinery a wolfman who begged for help
33719,who could keep a creature in such torment
33720,did you
33721,why is he here and those others like him
33722,only because you didnt tell me doctor
33723,you know id never want to come within light years of that creep again last time he tried to turn me into a bird woman
33724,i want out and i mean it
33725,yet you seem to court it so obviously
33726,at the risk of his companions life
33727,already the unfortunate peri has survived a struggle with the raak escaped from the guards and who doctor was sent to examine the wolfman
33728,who went into danger first
33729,your assistant as usual sagacity i have calculated on a random matrix sample that the doctors companions have been placed in danger twice as often as the doctor
33730,it is noted
33731,how lovely magnificence
33732,neither did they look very pleased
33733,sagacity may i be so bold as to suggest that we have already seen enough
33734,we have now seen many examples of the doctors interference we have heard the many requests from the doctors companion to withdraw from the situations we have witnessed yet constantly blatantly they have been ignored
33735,valeyard you have asked for the death penalty that is now a matter of record whereas i do not concur with the prisoner when he interrupts with the statement that his offences are minor you will have to provide this court with far more positive evidence of his guilt if you wish me to take your plea seriously
33736,sagacity
33737,take charge sil i will be dead as that raak if i wait for them to find the intruders at once before i perish then where will you be eh dead no worse than that poor oh oh oh my head
33738,hes alive
33739,what is it
33740,doctor
33741,from you thats a compliment
33742,the raak
33743,doctor we have the means to instill cooperation theres the technology to alter how brains think would you like to try the helmet on for size
33744,but i insist doctor our warrior king must have completed his advancement cycle you must replace him so we may coax the truth from your devious brain
33745,now the raak didnt attack you did he
33746,oh its peri peri
33747,come on your mind will soon clear well pile the heads of our enemies before us like melons in a heap
33748,come on doc wake up
33749,is that your defence doctor
33750,amnesia
33751,your mind has cleared from being taken out of time
33752,he lies sagacity
33753,no mentor            yrcanos
33754,then search them profitless fool
33755,doctor come here
33756,doctor the pleasure of your company is of course infinite but why have you chosen to warn us rather than help your friends
33757,so you betrayed your friends how wonderfully wise doctor
33758,you are planning some trickery of course this is a ploy yes
33759,you value your life
33760,i could have sworn you belonged to that stupid breed
33761,oh yes it is you were overcome by terror doctor you had interfered yet again and this time your one aim was to escape unscathed you you only your friends didnt matter
33762,you realise the matrix of time cannot lie
33763,doctor
33764,he is lying i do not trust him
33765,he cannot know the reasons of our concern
33766,we pay you enough we have given you a whole race of people to play with
33767,be certain that you are right crozier
33768,its multifunctional
33769,not yet
33770,do you wish me to denounce you then obey the call theres nothing to fear i shall go first
33771,i dont need you to tell me that sil
33772,what has happened how does this servitor know of your title
33773,doctor help me  doctor
33774,to what end
33775,what do you want
33776,what no stop this
33777,oh doctor i thought that brain transference pulse had made you crazy
33778,i was beginning to wonder
33779,how do i get out of this
33780,what
33781,but i dont know anything
33782,confess confess to what
33783,doctor whats wrong with you
33784,but what about me
33785,how can you be certain you have no clear memory of the incident and as we all know the matrix never lies
33786,may we continue i do grow tired of these constant interruptions
33787,whats happened to you doctor why do you hate me so
33788,just like that my dear doctor a toady a coward a turncoat you were afraid that crozier wanted to transplant the brain of the alien kiv into your head you said as much yourself the thought of that made you panic
33789,but youve also admitted that you have no clear memory of the event
33790,oh really and does any of your sudden and convenient recall agree with anything that the court has already seen
33791,and what does that mean
33792,it occurs to me doctor that your current mental condition makes it very difficult for you to defend yourself i would therefore suggest that this court be adjourned
33793,thank you valeyard no one is impugning your sanity doctor merely suggesting your memory is a little faulty
33794,i was also about to suggest that you might change your mind and consider availing yourself of a court defender a trained legal mind would offer a more constructive and certainly less emotional presentation of your case
33795,very well let us continue
33796,i have someone in mind ah doctor youve come to lend a hand
33797,that wont be necessary but you can monitor the btu
33798,youre right
33799,why is this taking so long
33800,prepare for independent support mode the reading should reach twenty one point five six
33801,approaching twenty dead
33802,twenty fifty twenty seventy five
33803,no this is a joke admittedly in bad taste but it is a profitless humourless quip tell them half my fortune if you give me a five minute start all right you profitless knaves all my money
33804,nothing
33805,one last chance
33806,thanks for the moral support sil
33807,success doctor after a decade of hard work i can transform the evolutionary process and conquer death the possibilities are endless
33808,now that youve assisted in a miracle of science doctor perhaps you would like to witness a similar feat of commerce
33809,interested doctor money money money money money money money all the stock and commodity markets of the universe are available to us via the warpfold relay see there an application for credit
33810,nothing much just a bunch of burnt out space rangers who search for wrecked spaceships they request funding to purchase another retrieval craft which we will deny
33811,for this company to retrieve
33812,the lord kiv will be most pleased with me for my great foresight i must be sure that i am the first familiar face he sees with his new eyes
33813,sagacity i wish to ask the accused why a time lord with all his privileges should meddle in a swamp world like thoros beta
33814,or perhaps a glass of water
33815,not a flicker why has the lord kiv not yet returned to life
33816,wait
33817,you said that last time
33818,oh not speculation i trust
33819,give up and you live resist and you die where you stand
33820,all that has taken place you are indirectly responsible for
33821,you still continue to ignore the truth
33822,i thought it was somewhat gratuitous
33823,i require nothing so crude my dear doctor all that will prove necessary is the truth
33824,why is the lord talking of such things he hates seawater
33825,just a body
33826,only some fisherman i had no other choice its taken me weeks to find one remotely suitable
33827,there wasnt the time
33828,you have blundered you have reduced the greatest business brain in this part of the galaxy to catcher of sea snakes
33829,yes yes take him to the induction centre what a pity both you and the alphan are unsuitable
33830,what about your companion doctor
33831,i think ill do that yet doctor you seem uneasy
33832,mmm hmm you have strong feelings for the woman
33833,die well my lady
33834,there is only one subject here in the implantation cubicle
33835,oh if you must but try not to disturb me
33836,yrcanos help me
33837,what yes who are you
33838,oh take no notice of me few people do
33839,yrcanos
33840,oh take him but be careful he has a very loud voice plays havoc with the audio system
33841,oh stop that youre a warrior not a wolf
33842,screeterder
33843,you must be out of your mind hell kill you
33844,gronwitcher
33845,dor dor
33846,his name is dorf and you are scum
33847,excellency welcome please please rest yourself
33848,i will not take another step until i am told the truth
33849,why did you release us
33850,that i understand but you are my sworn enemy i have vowed to kill you
33851,everyone has a point nowadays i am a man of action not reason
33852,then lead on oh but first i must find my bride to be
33853,im talking of the earth woman perpugilliam of the brown
33854,tuza i thought he was dead
33855,theres tuza and theres a guard
33856,you think like a warrior but you do not act like one its most perplexing
33857,ah doctor i see that youve found your renegade king certainly the quietest i have ever seen him
33858,oh how splendid
33859,oh for one wishfulfilling moment i thought you were going to kill him i presume you have croziers permission to carry out the experiment
33860,oh thats what i feared i wish crozier would keep me abreast of events he has no idea how much extra work his irregular activities create
33861,no for not shouting
33862,be silent wizened one otherwise youll be the first to die
33863,its one of croziers newest developments weve been having problems with some of the alphan slaves the implant helps to impede any fractious or rebellious thoughts its very effective doctor
33864,i know where it is
33865,to release slaves id envisioned a more noble cause for which to fight
33866,be silent i am king yrcanos of the krontep im quite capable of making my own decisions
33867,varoonik well release the slaves and then on to death varoonik
33868,carry on doctor     youre getting very good at anticipating my moves
33869,i believe she is with crozier
33870,i think mentor sil would like a word with you both
33871,no
33872,dorf is dead
33873,hes certainly a man of little modesty
33874,eh
33875,anarchy has broken out the servants have gone mad and good riddance i say all they do is eat you out of house and home
33876,things have gone too far you had released chaos and allowed your companion to take part in an experiment that would affect all future life in the universe
33877,it was judged by the high council as the most acceptable way and yrcanos will never know that he was used
33878,but peri died doctor because you abandoned her we had to end her life because your negligence had made it impossible for her to live
33879,please doctor
33880,we are all aware of your feelings of sorrow doctor has the recess given you sufficient time to overcome the distress of your bereavement
33881,the doctor is fighting for his life valeyard however i do take your point doctor are you ready to present your evidence
33882,the future is it going to be the doctors defence that he improves
33883,this i must see
33884,proceed
33885,completely when may we ask is the doctor going to embroil himself in this saga
33886,none i shall ignore his terminology but i do confess i share his curiosity
33887,obscurity is a recognised tactic for subterfuge
33888,hyperion flight one one three is now in progress        mel  doctor
33889,this will wake you up
33890,itll do you good honestly carrots are full of vitamin a
33891,its your waistline im concerned about
33892,listen when i start to call you neddy then you can worry drink up
33893,sixty nine seventy seventy one seventy two
33894,i have you said red
33895,come on doctor come on hurry
33896,no one sends a mayday call unless its a matter of life and death
33897,so its from someone who knows you
33898,panic desperation well we wont find out by hanging about in here will we
33899,ive never seen this side of you before youre usually the one who goes charging in regardless
33900,sense what
33901,doctor
33902,and i said move
33903,thank you sir
33904,we heard a noise in the cargo hold mister rudge and found these two
33905,commodore
33906,of all the places in this infinite universe you have to turn up on my ship
33907,dont bother rudge i know how what i dont know is why
33908,if i seem to lack gratitude young woman
33909,it is because on the previous occasion that the doctors path crossed mine i found myself involved in a web of mayhem and intrigue
33910,whatever happened in the past doesnt alter the fact that a mayday call was sent
33911,stand easy doctor youre not leaving
33912,give him enough rope and he will snare our culprit for us      the doctor has his feet up on one of the small tables he picks up a bowl of nibbles but mel makes him put them down again
33913,im not complaining youre really worried arent you
33914,theres a made to measure candidate
33915,the commodore hes met you before
33916,would he admit he needs outside assistance
33917,look the quickest way out of this is to solve the mystery
33918,why dont you ask for a passenger list
33919,whos hustling all im saying is that you might recognise a name simple isnt it

33936,very well what i have done to be landed with him i fail to comprehend take over
33937,emergency in the waste disposal unit
33938,then i suggest you begin earning your salary and find out who that belongs to
33939,somehow that doesnt surprise me
33940,doesnt follow that he wound up in the pulveriser
33941,and there was a single shoe exactly the same pattern as that
33942,any suggestions why a mineralogist who wanted to see you should be killed
33943,hey i dont care who you are youve no right to say that to the doctor
33944,what do you mean
33945,so we give up
33946,the hydroponic centre i told you about the sudden panic when i was in here   mel what
33947,how could you remember these events are in your future
33948,i stand corrected but my assumption of why he has pursued such an arbitrary course in aborting this tale still remains
33949,that she too is going to her death
33950,preposterous absolutely preposterous forgive me sagacity the idea the matrix could lie no it is we who are being manipulated
33951,to obscure the damaging truth
33952,the truth doctor you sent your companion down the cargo hold into a situation which you described i quote cant you sense it mel evil theres evil in this place
33953,you could have prevented her from going into the cargo hold instead you appear to encourage her
33954,do you wish to reconsider doctor
33955,why arent you wearing a pulsometer the heart should be monitored while exercising
33956,a double pulse what are you a comedian
33957,doctor youre required on the bridge
33958,how long have you known this woman
33959,i should accept that advice and drop the sophistry can you vouch for her
33960,i havent tried i persuaded edwardes to show me the hydroponic centre it was boobytrapped
33961,but he must be there
33962,oh come on you know me am i prone to that sort of imagination
33963,the guards disappeared too well now perhaps youll accept that im not responsible youve had me in custody
33964,look doctor you cant just play a passive role we were sent for remember
33965,about what
33966,where are they
33967,you know exactly what i mean where are the seeds the ones you picked up in the wrecked cabin or did you think id forgotten
33968,oh come on
33969,professor lasky shes an agronomist im going to ask her
33970,you
33971,oh its you the comedian what do you want
33972,a thremmatologist to be precise
33973,that puts an entirely different complexion on the situation pity your friend the comedian wasnt as lucid
33974,are they special professor
33975,demeter seeds yes they are they represent a tremendous advance a colossal leap
33976,what did you call them the demeter seeds
33977,food of the gods bruchner my assistant bit of a romantic highly strung he christened them
33978,what is it man dont stand there hovering
33979,no doctor
33980,if youll excuse me politics do not come into my realm of influence
33981,who are you another prospector
33982,are we to be subjected to a dissertation on interplanetary politics now sagacity
33983,mining rights mogarians versus earthlings what else would you call that
33984,my eyes never left the screen
33985,an occasion that will not arise doctor your lives are forfeit as i have ably proven
33986,then for pitys sake tell us what it was that happened and enjoy your moment of triumph
33987,another murder
33988,no the passengers are already uneasy do you want them to realise theyre trapped with a killer on the loose
33989,are you trying to kill him
33990,mogarians cant breathe oxygen surely youre aware of that
33991,then who is he
33992,its grenville
33993,the man whos supposed to have been dumped in the pulveriser
33994,poor mister hallett i knew it was hallett i recognised him remember
33995,but he denied it he insisted his name was grenville
33996,well whether his names grenville or hallett why did he stage his own death in the pulveriser
33997,i have
33998,are you saying we had an undercover agent aboard and i wasnt informed
33999,me
34000,is all this guesswork or have you any more tricks up your sleeve
34001,all nice and lily white doctor but it does leave one nasty little problem
34002,that would be a serious offence doctor
34003,perhaps we may hear your explanation
34004,yes the investigator halletts methods were very unorthodox
34005,anyone there could have poisoned his drink
34006,us do i detect a commitment at last because of halletts death you said you admired him
34007,what are you doing away from your post the isolation room is under no circumstances to be left unguarded if it happens again i shall report you to the commodore
34008,youd do that without being asked
34009,well he was running out of time the mayday message said as much perative traitor be identified before landing earth id guess the incomplete word was imperative wouldnt you
34010,i shall probably regret this but go on ill buy it envied me what
34011,compliments you are undergoing a change
34012,doctor i realise youre trying to take my mind off poor edwardes
34013,no
34014,i didnt see you take it
34015,im not into agronomy ask the professor
34016,youre going to have to enlighten me its out of my range
34017,im not much wiser
34018,ive brought your warm drink sir shall i leave it on the dressing table
34019,seeing as theres only one way to find out youve got two problems
34020,did you hear that
34021,out out
34022,never mind the guard that monstrosity what is it in there
34023,the experimental nature of our work entails some calculated risks
34024,oh doctor you do have the knack of landing yourself in hot water
34025,simply doing his duty miss the regulations are quite specific anyone setting off a false alarm on an intergalactic liner is to be arrested forthwith
34026,not to me to the commodore hes expecting you take him
34027,doctor
34028,that way
34029,much of your evidence does seem to contradict your stated aim doctor are you saying the matrix is again being falsified
34030,ha
34031,doctor this court is dedicated to giving you a fair trial do not abuse its indulgence
34032,bring us in closer reduce the margin by a factor of point naught one to naught two
34033,not to a ship of the hyperion class
34034,thatll do pull yourself together going to pieces wont help well search the passenger quarters before we start assuming the worst
34035,im not questioning your honesty simply your methods however im left with little alternative but to begin to cooperate
34036,fair comment
34037,you underestimate me to that extent do you
34038,top secret by the time theyve gone through channels well probably have docked
34039,no one will be allowed to disembark the murderer wont escape
34040,amplifier  vervoid
34041,waste bins
34042,well the pulveriser but why
34043,we shall not have long to wait
34044,what has
34045,its a waste of time our killers obviously removed it
34046,he why not she
34047,or the stewardess janet
34048,it wouldnt have taken a mans strength to lift my weight a woman could have dumped me in the waste bin
34049,whatever they are theyre not human and were all to be destroyed remember
34050,where are you off to
34051,and what about me
34052,are we to be subjected to more chicanery sagacity
34053,ridiculous we all saw you youre hardly mistakable in that outfit
34054,are you saying the communications equipment was not sabotaged
34055,then who did
34056,the murderer i think inquisitor the doctor is telling us more than he realises
34057,are you doctor
34058,if you are questioning its veracity is there any point in continuing with the matrix
34059,with you as leader well you fulfil that role to the last youve led me to see the fault in my strategy you me doland even the creatures weve spawned the sole representatives of this great advance and were all encapsulated on this ship on this ship
34060,i dont care what you heard on some mythical tape
34061,this is no time to debate ethics i made that mistake with bruchner i tell you the mans demented hes out to destroy this ship and everyone on it
34062,first things first lets find bruchner
34063,yes but why whats his motive
34064,all right then whats  just tell me doctor
34065,very thorough
34066,isnt that obvious were running into turbulence
34067,dont talk in riddles man
34068,thats a question no one has survived to answer
34069,marsh gas where the devils that come from what is it you two know that i dont
34070,itd be suicide
34071,its my ship if theres a risk to be taken ill take it
34072,the mortality rate that attends your meddling is appalling
34073,what he is stating in the usually devious human manner is that we are taking over the ship
34074,still not responding mister doland ive just tried
34075,stay back professor lasky reach into the commodores pocket and take out the keys carefully
34076,for me not a thing the mogarians are after the consignment of precious metals got this quaint notion it was plundered from their planet and theyre just recovering stolen property
34077,theres a first aid kit in the cabinet
34078,not my problem doctor in less than an hour we will rendezvous with our pickup
34079,you dont believe that rudge is behind these killings do you
34080,so whatever the outcome of this hijack were still at the mercy of a murderer
34081,doctor the air duct
34082,shall i join you theres going to be an attack on the lounge when you hear the fire alarm dive for cover
34083,what do you mean no
34084,the bridge
34085,once i get this ship back on course ill want some answers from you professor and that goes for you too doctor
34086,then why havent i heard it
34087,youve got it
34088,a phaser you
34089,i dont buy that and why the public announcement about the tape everyone could hear
34090,i recognise that innocent tone whats going on
34091,lasky
34092,if youre looking for a certain tape doctor i dont think youll find it in there
34093,obviously a denial isnt going to impress you may i know of what im accused
34094,murder am i supposed to treat this seriously
34095,then i suggest you search the professors cabin
34096,you really are serious
34097,so this tape its important
34098,im afraid the professor has the only key
34099,not that itll do you much good ive wiped it
34100,you still suspected me yet you came down here
34101,all this could have applied to lasky
34102,and my motive
34103,then youre not as astute as i thought doctor those creatures we call them vervoids represent vast economic power
34104,oh but i shall no matter what the cost then robots can be dumped on the scrap heap vervoids will run the factories and farms at practically no cost all they need is sunlight and water
34105,a consortium with the vision to recognise the potential of the vervoids
34106,the most enduring and spectacular empire rome was built on slave labour
34107,which brings us neatly to you
34108,you created these psychopaths now tell me how to get rid of them
34109,something must have gone wrong radically wrong a malfunction of the dna
34110,maybe we lack your divine insight
34111,logic
34112,er wait a second animalkind
34113,it is hes making sense the vervoids are plants
34114,its a question of selfpreservation kill or be killed
34115,equally theres no choice and that goes for you too doctor we need your undivided commitment
34116,doctor do you wish to continue
34117,any more ideas doctor
34118,a cytogeneticist now youre a man of varied talents
34119,doctor theres something out there
34120,not this side of the hold im going to talk to them
34121,perhaps they will to me i wasnt going to exploit them like doland theyll know that
34122,how could they its obscene
34123,you cant justify it its just
34124,put them on a compost heap
34125,its useless commodore
34126,name it
34127,weve been over that
34128,how the blazes do we do that
34129,vionesium
34130,and worth a princes ransom
34131,but how will this vionesium accelerate the vervoid life cycle
34132,seasons you can forget if you dont weve seen what these creatures can do
34133,all right doctor you can have the vionesium whats the drill
34134,me
34135,no
34136,i shall remember that the next time we get a mayday call
34137,thats his idea of a compliment comparing me to an elephant
34138,did none of the unfortunate creatures survive doctor
34139,every vervoid was destroyed by your ingenious plan
34140,you refer to article seven of gallifreyan law
34141,i shall deal with that charge in due course valeyard now kindly dont interrupt me again doctor do you have any further evidence in your defence
34142,do you still maintain the matrix has been tampered with
34143,quite impossible my lady no one may enter the matrix without the key of rassilon  the keeper indicates a large oldfashioned key fastened to his collar of office
34144,qualified people for inspection once in a millennium perhaps to replace a transductor
34145,the key of rassilon never leaves my possession
34146,that is accepted doctor wild accusations of malfeasance do not constitute a defence
34147,and who would do such a thing even if it were possible
34148,there is only one to rebut the evidence of the matrix doctor and that is to produce witnesses who can support your version of events can you do that
34149,then we must accept the valeyards evidence
34150,procrastination my lady the doctor only
34151,you said you were sent here sabalom glitz by whom  master
34152,whos that
34153,this is an independent inquiry appointed by the high council to investigate serious charges  master
34154,doctor please examine your witnesses
34155,this is real machonite you know worth a few grotzits today your honour
34156,i could make you a fair offer on a job lot do you a very good deal
34157,what
34158,yeah well hes a business partner so to speak weve had a few nice little tickles together
34159,very good doctor keep him to the point
34160,right
34161,right well it seems the sleepers had found a way to break into the matrix and they were creaming off all this hightech info to take back to andromeda
34162,hes lying my lady
34163,thats it doc now were getting at the dirt
34164,well eventually the time lords did suss out the leak so they wanted to wipe out all the sleepers and they used this er magno magno
34165,thats it
34166,big market for them doctor so he said worth a lot of grotzits
34167,doctor these unseemly outbursts
34168,this is clearly
34169,the single purpose of this trial is to determine the defendants guilt or otherwise on the basis of the evidence that has been presented anything else is for the moment irrelevant
34170,valeyard
34171,but he hasnt had time
34172,the seventh door he must have had a key
34173,the seventh entrance to the matrix
34174,dont go doctor
34175,come along both of you
34176,doctor
34177,whats going on
34178,looks like someones had a go at you
34179,what
34180,oh yeah sure
34181,argh
34182,how can we be in a different world we just stepped through a door thats all
34183,now if you dont mind telling me how do i get out of here
34184,i know ive just given it to you he said it would be useful
34185,the fantasy factory proprietor j j chambers
34186,yeah well im sure youll find out im off
34187,ive done my bit
34188,youre a hard man doctor i could have been killed
34189,yeah well whoever threw that harpoon didnt know that so much for illusions anyway i thought it was you he was trying to kill
34190,oh i see he humiliates you by throwing harpoons at me it makes a lot of sense
34191,look doctor im a smalltime crook with smalltime ambitions one of which is to stay alive im sorry doctor i wish you every good luck but im on my way ive done my bit
34192,all right ill help you
34193,you beast   am i to take it that some base desire for revenge is your motive for interfering  master
34194,yes
34195,do you have an appointment sir mister chambers only sees people by appointment most particular about appointments is our mister chambers
34196,what is your name sir
34197,if this valeyard wants you dead hes got a funny way of going about it
34198,there are procedures to follow sir necessary routines to be completed even when ive found your names there are many forms to be inscribed before you may move on to the next stage of processing processing is very important in this establishment im sure that even you will understand that such things cannot be rushed sir
34199,you cant go in there not without an appointment
34200,whats he talking about
34201,for example you wish to see the proprietor now the correct procedure is to make an appointment
34202,i dont understand any of this here we are waiting to duck a terminal knuckle sandwich and all this screeves going on about is whether weve got an appointment or not
34203,expedite i am a senior clerk sir to me the procedure is sacrosanct my work is a celebration of all that is perfect why speed perfection
34204,you seem to have found the one little weakness in our procedure sir would you sign this
34205,a consent form sir the corridors in this factory are very long and dark should you unexpectedly die our blessed proprietor mister j j chambers insists he inherits your remaining lives
34206,sign that and youre a dead man
34207,are you sure about this
34208,this is madness
34209,oh great cosmic protector of grafters and dissemblers save me save me a voice from the grave  doctor
34210,i dont get it
34211,fortunately there is a reality that you and i can both agree on the ultimate reality
34212,the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns
34213,i really must curb these urges ive no wish to be contaminated by your whims and idiosyncrasies
34214,hes over here doc slippery customer your other persona
34215,where are you off to now
34216,but he was here
34217,whats that
34218,another illusion
34219,sea mist fog
34220,youve got to tell someone else before he
34221,give me the key to the matrix im going in there
34222,it will not happen again
34223,with the doctor as my enemy i always have the advantage
34224,then stay here and find out    mel
34225,doctor is that you
34226,this way quickly
34227,forget the questions youre alive thats all that matters now please follow me before its too late
34228,to get you out of this unholy mess
34229,doctor trust me dont you see that until youve cleared your name youre no better than the valeyard is a renegade on the run an outcast
34230,would you accept her as an impartial witness
34231,what shall i say doctor
34232,yes but i dont want her to twist it like the valeyard did
34233,appropriate somethings going wrong here i can sense it you said the truth couldnt harm you yet i have the feeling im attending a lynching party tell them you had no choice doctor
34234,no leave him alone
34235,well i can        children
34236,never mind the sydney carton heroics youre not signing on as a martyr yet
34237,that trial was an illusion
34238,ruined ive just saved your neck
34239,but you were on your way to
34240,you knew it was an illusion how come
34241,okay okay im not deaf
34242,where
34243,i still reckon wed be better off outside the matrix
34244,it seems to me we should try and draw the valeyard out to where the odds would be more even
34245,i hate to say this but er use you as bait
34246,oh come on just look at the elaborate lengths hes gone to already
34247,there are times in our relationship when i feel an interpreter wouldnt come amiss
34248,youd like to negotiate mister popplewick sir
34249,a list of names
34250,why are they all crossed through
34251,no
34252,this minion has agreed to take us to his boss the mysterious mister j j chambers
34253,if he isnt therell be one bureaucrat less in the matrix
34254,very astute of you doc you should live a long time
34255,whats the secret
34256,my trust of you is in equal proportion to your trust of me the tardis is over there
34257,doctor there is another priority the valeyard remember
34258,wheres glitz
34259,er yes i perceive mister chambers is not here i shall go and find him for you sir
34260,im awfully sorry sir i dont seem to be able to locate mister chambers
34261,this is preposterous you will regret this mister chambers will demand an explanation for this iniquitous this wicked behaviour
34262,how did you know
34263,youll soon have ample scope to indulge in melodrama
34264,a megabyte modem
34265,a maser
34266,yes doctor enlighten us disseminate the news
34267,destroy us and you destroy yourself whats the joke
34268,but how these time lords or supreme guardians of the law as you called them are all in the trial room and were in the matrix
34269,but i cant leave you
34270,you are elevating futility to a high art theres nothing you can do to prevent the catharsis of spurious morality
34271,then get out of here quickly your lives depend on it
34272,what have you done
34273,you blundering imbecile you triggered a ray phase shift that may amass a feedback into here
34274,no its too late
34275,all charges against you are dismissed doctor we owe you an immense debt of gratitude which i can partly repay by telling you that the young woman miss perpugilliam brown is alive and well and living as a warrior queen with king yrcanos
34276,now then once law and order have been restored a new high council will need to be elected can i persuade you to stand for lord president again
34277,hes going to suggest you stand
34278,i shouldnt broadcast that if i were you
34279,simply name it
34280,right a bracing glass of carrot juice
34281,and then well get you back on the exerciser
34282,come on
34283,oh yes indeed i have
34284,this is idiotic youll injure yourself
34285,my contempt started long before my exile
34286,shes perfectly safe but how long she remains so depends on you
34287,you wont recognise the planet its lakertya and theres no evidence that its ever been graced by your meddling presence
34288,i didnt go to the trouble of bringing you here just to discuss the ethics of my work
34289,i had all i can take of that cant in our university days am i expected to abandon my research because of the side effects on inferior species are you prepared to abandon walking in case you squash an insect underfoot
34290,and thats the last time she will interfere
34291,urak
34292,you arrived from outer space as they did now they can have you back on my terms
34293,mel melanie are you all right doctor

34302,yes it exploded and threw you to the floor me too knocked us both cold when i came round you looked like this
34303,you mean this is what youre going to be like permanently
34304,so you remember the tardis then
34305,oh dont worry itll soon wear off meanwhile why not repair the machine you said it was important
34306,but youre a genius
34307,especially in thermodynamics
34308,you told me you said it was your special subject when you were at university
34309,doctor this machine has to be repaired and youre the only person with the knowledge to do it
34310,no not like you although almost as hideous
34311,come on where
34312,well what is it you want
34313,it was your fault
34314,tools blames his tools
34315,now how could i possibly think that doctor
34316,but surely theres a catalyst
34317,why do you think that
34318,always providing they dont flush us out first
34319,i have no idea
34320,dont blame me doctor ive never been inside you wouldnt let me
34321,no you said the air wasnt sterile enough for humans
34322,oh come on now

34324,to do what
34325,youre just overexcited here drink this
34326,just water
34327,you cant loll around its simply not like you
34328,yes youve changed outwardly but im sure you must still have the same sweet nature
34329,but you didnt mean it i was at fault
34330,what about the tardis wont there be a radiation wave meter there
34331,yes of course
34332,well then find her you incompetent fool
34333,if hes been captured hes as good as dead
34334,lakertyan a race so indolent they cant be bothered to bury their dead
34335,theres not a lot to remember the benevolent climate has induced lethargy theyve failed to realise their full potential
34336,not mine yours
34337,all right ill find him without you one thing about the doctor you cant miss him in that outfit
34338,pretentious is the word
34339,yes yes yes very elegant
34340,im sorry but you seemed to be losing control
34341,radiation wave meter thats what we came here for
34342,tool room
34343,focus in on her  urak
34344,is that her doctor
34345,and shes evil
34346,then she must be destroyed
34347,no this is the first time but mel if you dont stop squawking itll be the last
34348,shes got nobody to blame but herself
34349,well id have thought the reason was obvious
34350,she must be on the brink of a major discovery
34351,all the more reason to press on get there first youve repeatedly said that in the wrong hands scientific knowledge can be dangerous
34352,oh dont start all that again look repair the machine and maybe well find the solution
34353,oh forget the rani shes finished destroyed
34354,im overwhelmed
34355,such superior diagnostic talents
34356,well then its a pity they cant be concentrated on the machine
34357,perhaps shes fashion conscious
34358,really are you going to be much longer in there doctor
34359,hurry ikona hurry
34360,what was the mistake
34361,you mean i you used the wrong heat conducting material
34362,so if we substituted a suitable material would it work
34363,doctor is this relevant
34364,did i oh i must have forgotten
34365,elephant
34366,oh perhaps the machine exploding affected my memory too doctor what were the readings
34367,come on
34368,i asked you a question
34369,yes i dare say would phb or pes do
34370,as a suitable material for the machine
34371,what are you looking for
34372,you wont find it there what about the alternative
34373,slightly amber almost opaque
34374,i know where i can get some
34375,from the lakertyans you repair the machine ill go and get it
34376,did i
34377,who are you
34378,wheres the doctor
34379,now well get to the truth what have you done with him you brute
34380,where under the carpet
34381,help put me down oh
34382,inquests bore me
34383,you told me
34384,i am mel whos the rani
34385,ive had enough of this drivel
34386,dont touch me
34387,you dont even talk like the doctor you miserable fraud
34388,youre a raving lunatic
34389,and if im mel
34390,well perhaps the real doctor told you it was his favourite drink
34391,oh
34392,but if youre the real doctor then why do you look like that
34393,a double pulse then you really are the doctor
34394,i know about regeneration of course
34395,but youre completely different nothing like you were face height hair everythings changed
34396,the rani is that who hijacked the tardis
34397,i told you not to enter my tardis without permission now stay here
34398,never heard of it
34399,computers are my speciality not nuclear physics
34400,well what can the ranis interest be
34401,and then itd be goodbye lakertya
34402,its weird its like a giant heartbeat
34403,oh forget it doctor lets hightail it back to the tardis and get out of here
34404,nine five three
34405,well go on quick nine five three
34406,names which are meaningless to us
34407,shes a murderess sarn was not her first victim thereve been many
34408,you sound as though you admire her
34409,the fascinations mutual shes reserved this one for you
34410,youre a time lord
34411,ive never been permitted to see
34412,shes coming
34413,doctor you cant stay
34414,in the store room doctor why was the monitor on
34415,quite adept at manoeuvring arent you doctor
34416,do i take it the machines now operational
34417,such as
34418,less ideally
34419,the informations essential is it
34420,so if i told you its chemical composition i could do that
34421,but your usefulness is not yet over you have another role to play
34422,oh out of my way the mistress has profound insight but i think she is mistaken to rely on any of your worthless race
34423,the tetraps are nobodys pets and youd be wise not to forget it
34424,doctor please hurry
34425,if youre still here when she gets back youll find out from inside the cabinet
34426,if she catches you yes
34427,be careful doctor the grounds outside are a minefield of traps
34428,a harmless asteroid
34429,she wont need one youre going to put it back give it to me
34430,the mistress will be overjoyed to see you you know where to take her    ikona
34431,you must be the doctor ive met your companion mel
34432,oh i see where she gets her sense of humour youre going to need it
34433,now step back very slowly
34434,faroon deliver the message to the doctor i believe that you will find him in the centre of leisure
34435,the centre of leisure the centre of indolence
34436,no i cant imagine why beyus told you to come to this place
34437,from these spineless pleasure seekers
34438,it would require effort thats why doctor theyve become spoonfed drones theres no need for them to strive an indulgent system provides all well didnt beyus give you any clue as to what to look for
34439,only that another pointless embellishment
34440,i did warn you
34441,do you still insist that beyus should not count the cost of resistance ikona if every cell in the globe were opened there wouldnt be a lakertyan left alive
34442,doctor i have a message for you
34443,so stupid you are not a worthy opponent for the rani
34444,doctor in my opinion returning to the laboratory is a pointless exercise ive a feeling mels beyond all help
34445,well then why the hologram why didnt she just release mel
34446,youre probably right
34447,i could nominate a few candidates for extermination myself
34448,no doubt itll still play havoc with our planet
34449,could it be the solstice thats due
34450,and i shall dispose of you this will rid me of the pair of you
34451,give her a taste of her own medicine shall i switch on
34452,doctor before this regeneration you were on keen on cats and you know what curiosity did to them
34453,it isnt all that will be fixed if we dont get out of here
34454,ill try and contact the doctor we need his help
34455,all i realise is that weve seen what she intends to happen to lakertya can she do it
34456,you said that strange matter was incredibly heavy
34457,well could she be using the brain to come up with a formula
34458,well then havent we come up with the answer
34459,to discover how to reconstruct the same event
34460,well calm down lets apply a bit of logic shall we what is it that you can contribute that those other geniuses cant
34461,so now you know
34462,perhaps unlike you it only speaks when it has something intelligent to say
34463,in the aftermath of the explosion helium two will fuse with the upper zones of the lakertyan atmosphere to form a shell of chronons i dont have to tell you what chronons are do i doctor
34464,in the same millisecond that chronon shell is being formed the hothouse effect of the gamma rays will cause the primate functions of the brain to go into chain reaction multiplying until the gap between shell and planet is filled
34465,a cerebral mass capable of dominating and controlling time anywhere in the cosmos
34466,the potential of the dinosaurs was never fully realised
34467,oh i shall be back once the turbulence has subsided
34468,doctor
34469,doctor
34470,doctor ive got to talk to you
34471,unless you can tell them how to removes these bangles they cant help
34472,oh thats a daft idea theyre bound to be booby trapped
34473,where theres a will theres a
34474,doctor havent you overlooked something if the rani releases the insects well all be dead
34475,sting
34476,faroon you were warned not to listen to him
34477,what is it you want me to do

34781,ah welcome campers now i am your camp leader while you are at shangri la my name is burton
34782,where is it
34783,a freezer centre how boring
34784,do you take asteroid express
34785,shush keep your voice down no of course i havent forgotten you mel and the doc here youre not the doctor
34786,here you couldnt do us a favour could you you see im in a spot of bother
34787,i have been entrusted to deliver certain secret documents which nefarious unnamed parties would stop at nothing to grasp within their own grubby digits
34788,leave him alone if you kill him you kill us too
34789,becoming quite a storyteller arent we glitz im afraid you also seem to be a victim of mister glitzs cavalier attitude toward facts
34790,and mister kane does not run iceworld to subsidise crooks like yourself the hundred crowns please
34791,i cant
34792,doctor youve got to help me
34793,i knew there must be a reason why you brought us here you want to see the dragon dont you
34794,like the lock ness monster
34795,youre going to go looking for the dragon
34796,oh cool can i come too
34797,oh im fed up with being a waitress oh go on professor let me come too
34798,ace and can we search for the treasure too
34799,not for the moment i think theres no reason for them to suspect that the seal on the treasure map contains a tracking device
34800,an honest transaction the man was desperate not to lose this map so i know its something very very tasty
34801,no one goes down there any more too dangerous
34802,but like the girl says doctor its too dangerous
34803,what do you want to go here the lake of oblivion
34804,cor this sounds brill
34805,everyone calls me ace
34806,too risky if you ask me
34807,oh nice
34808,that is correct
34809,were still too close to the upper levels doctor lets cast me eyes over the map
34810,of course
34811,but these arent trees
34812,well wheres the singing coming from
34813,i bet this is worth a few grotzits
34814,do
34815,you mean someone made all this dragons
34816,leave me alone get off stop it not fair
34817,its no use doctor ive located the ice garden but theres a distinct absence of dragon or treasure
34818,oh i suppose you want me to risk my neck and come and help you
34819,all right all right dont get your delicates in a twist
34820,what could be more appropriate than to despatch some of glitzs former crew after the girls he betrayed his crew now they can have their revenge everyone should be allowed his moment of revenge
34821,its no use doctor even if we did find the treasure itd take us longer than seventy two hours and belazs said if i didnt return kanes money within seventy two hours theyd confiscate my spacecraft
34822,oh hed slice his own mother up to make a point if he was a mortician the corpses would keep their eyes open
34823,in fact if kane knew we were after the      glitz
34824,exactly which is why ive come to the conclusion that play it by the rules is a mugs game i have decided to hijack the nosferatu which is where you come in doctor
34825,look ill do you a good deal you help me get the nosferatu back and ill give you the treasure map sos you and mel can go looking for this dragon i cant say fairer than that can i
34826,youre a man of insight and logic doctor
34827,theres only one guard do you think you can occupy him while i slip on board
34828,go on then away you go
34829,i think youll find most educated people regard mythical convictions as fundamentally animistic
34830,personally i find most experiences border on the existential
34831,i think youll find that a concept can be philosophically valid even if theologically meaningless
34832,oh youve no idea what a relief it is for me to have such a stimulating philosophical discussion there are so few intellectuals about these days tell me what do you think of the assertion that the semiotic thickness of a performed text varies according to the redundancy of auxiliary performance codes
34833,then i shall just have to make sure you dont manage to find the money in time i shall have to make very sure
34834,what are you doing here
34835,i think shes going to kill us doctor
34836,kane doesnt own me

35070,and if we dont
35071,this is bbc television the time is a quarter past five and saturday viewing continues with an adventure in the new science fiction series doc
35072,it would be foolish of me i suppose to hope that this mothership was not nuclear capable
35073,weve got the parts you wanted doctor where do you want them
35074,is that their main base doctor
35075,and do they both come from outer space
35076,shouldnt we send for reinforcements armoured units
35077,and we have no defence
35078,what does it do
35079,and the worst
35080,doctor red nine reports an increase in modulated signalling
35081,just a minute
35082,the signal emanates from coal hill school multiple sources in close proximity
35083,transmat what does that mean
35084,doctor theres no reply from my men at the school

35090,this ones still active
35091,what was that
35092,the other dalek was underdeveloped with vestigial limbs and sensory organs almost amoeboid allison look this is altogether different it has functional appendages and some kind of mechanical prosthesis grafted into its very body i think im going to be sick
35093,i had an argument with a window
35094,i came to get my tape deck
35095,its in little bits

35109,sorry go on
35110,his hand what good was that
35111,ive noticed that
35112,we

35114,and you have to try and stop them
35115,eh
35116,so all this is
35117,oh well devious so the daleks grab the hand of omega and go and no one gets hurt brilliant
35118,what
35119,shouldnt we take mike
35120,so what are we doing
35121,you will come with us

35129,thats well boggling
35130,what is it
35131,have you busted it
35132,why didnt you just run off with the hand of omega and give it to the other daleks
35133,suspicious of what you still havent told me w

35150,you are the doctor
35151,you are the enemy of the daleks
35152,you must be exterminat
35153,what did you do to it

35155,what about the massive ground defences
35156,you said it mate
35157,you cant do that you mashed up the transmat remember
35158,ive no idea im a physicist
35159,it was a vain hope
35160,now doctor will you please answer one question
35161,why are two dalek factions fighting each other
35162,its simple isnt it renegade daleks are blobs
35163,imperial daleks are bionic blobs with bits added you can tell that daleks are into racial purity so one lot of daleks reckon the other lot of blobs are too different theyre mutants not pure in their blobbiness
35164,they hate each others chromosomes war to the death
35165,doctor how do you do that

35438,windsor were in the castle
35439,i thought itd be a lot posher than this
35440,we cant go nicking stuff in here
35441,its probably treason im too young to go to the tower
35442,it might make a difference if youd let me know what was going on professor but i suppose theres no time
35443,was that a bomb
35444,youre amazing professor being able to tell all that just from the noise
35445,ah this case contained the bow of nemesis property of the crown which disappeared mysteriously in 1788 legend has it that unless a place is kept for the bow in the castle the entire silver statue will return to destroy the world
35446,it does that sometimes even in the 1980s what i want to know is how can a statue destroy the world
35447,sorry professor
35448,okay professor so where are we now
35449,and is it really 1638
35450,what
35451,what is it
35452,who does this house belong to anyway

35454,1988
35455,so the bow belonged to her
35456,professor
35457,three one eight to base hey look theres someone inside
35458,black magic
35459,so it wasnt just silver this stuff that fell from the sky
35460,living metal
35461,but if you launched it into space how come its capable of destruction
35462,ive been here before
35463,no with the school
35464,not really windsor castles a big place
35465,i really dont think we should be doing this
35466,i dont know i might be able to tell if i actually knew where we were going we didnt actually cover the royal residential areas on the school trip theres someone coming
35467,do what
35468,doctor

35486,i dont know anything about it
35487,i have the bow

35491,like at the castle
35492,tell me where the arrow is i want you to tell me where to find the arrow

35505,is that what we came here for
35506,i really dont like this place can we make a move

36728,where are you from
36729,they all speak english
36730,its inside my brain
36731,your machine gets inside my head it gets inside and it changes my mind and you didnt even ask
36732,no you were too busy thinking up cheap shots about the deep south who are you then doctor what are you called what sort of alien are you

36740,that was five billion years ago so shes dead now five billion years later my mums dead
36741,indubitably this is the bad wolf scenario i find the inherent laxity of the ongoing multiverse
36742,its the sound of metal it doesnt make any sense to me
36743,i dont know but the maintenance duct is just behind our guest suite i could show you and your wife
36744,partner

36748,theres just the steward and the staff all the rest is controlled by the metal mind
36749,the corporation they move platform one from one artistic event to another
36750,theyre not needed this facility is purely automatic its the height of the alpha class nothing can go wrong
36751,if you like the nautical metaphor is appropriate
36752,im afraid not
36753,i was born on that planet and so was my mum and so was my dad and that makes me officially the last human being in this room cos youre not human youve had it all nipped and tucked and flattened till theres nothing left anything human got chucked in the bin youre just skin cassandra lipstick and skin nice talking
36754,respect for the earth
36755,well perhaps its a case of having to be seen at the right occasions
36756,all the same we respect the earth as family so many species evolved from that planet mankind is only one im another my ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below and im a direct descendant of the tropical rainforest
36757,and what about your ancestry doctor perhaps you could tell a story or two perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when theres nothing else left i scanned you earlier the metal machine had trouble identifying your species it refused to admit your existence and even when it named you i wouldnt believe it but it was right i know where youre from forgive me for intruding but its remarkable that you even exist i just wanted to say how sorry i am
36758,is it part of the retro

37533,but bad means good isnt that right
37534,we just stopped off we need to refuel the thing is cardiffs got this rift running through the middle of the city its invisible but its like an earthquake fault between different dimensions
37535,but closing a rift always leaves a scar and that scar generates energy harmless to the human race
37536,my god have you seen yourselves you all think youre so clever dont you
37537,yep
37538,its a cloaking device
37539,so it copied a real thing there actually was police boxes
37540,why dont you just fix the circuit
37541,but thats what i meant theres no police boxes anymore so doesnt it get noticed
37542,whats the plan
37543,i swear six feet tall and with big tusks
37544,i mean it turns out the white things are tusks and i mean tusks and its woken and its not happy
37545,no i just picked him up went right for the ship full throttle didnt stop until i hit the spacelanes i was shaking it was unbelievable it freaked me out and by the time i got fifteen light years away i realised im like this
37546,according to intelligence the target is the last surviving member of the slitheen family a criminal sect from the planet raxacoricofallapatorious masquerading as a human being zipped inside a skin suit okay plan of attack we assume a basic fifty seven fifty six strategy covering all available exits on the ground floor doctor you go face to face thatll designate exit one ill cover exit two rose you exit three mickey smith you take exit four have you got that
37547,sorry awaiting orders sir
37548,present arms

37556,here i am
37557,oh the doctors very good at teleports
37558,this is persecution why cant you leave me alone what did i ever do to you
37559,apart from that
37560,a philanthropic gesture ive learnt the error of my ways
37561,a rift in space and time if this power station went into meltdown the entire planet would go
37562,shes not even a she shes a thing
37563,is that a tribophysical waveform macrokinetic extrapolator
37564,like stepping on an anthill
37565,what blaidd drwg its welsh
37566,i chose it at random thats all i dont know it just sounded good does it matter
37567,whats it mean
37568,but ive heard that before bad wolf ive heard that lots of times
37569,how can they be following us
37570,i dont believe it we actually get to go to raxa wait a minute raxacor
37571,raxacorico
37572,they have the death penalty the family slitheen was tried in its absence many years ago and found guilty with no chance of appeal according to the statutes of government the moment i return i am to be executed what do you make of that doctor take me home and you take me to my death
37573,this ship is impossible its superb how do you get the outside around the inside
37574,i almost feel better about being defeated i never stood a chance this is the technology of the gods
37575,mustve been a great big heist its stacked with power
37576,its not compatible but it should knock off about twelve hours well be ready to go by morning
37577,so whats on
37578,i gather its not always like this having to wait i bet youre always the first to leave doctor never mind the consequences off you go you butchered my family and then ran for the stars am i right but not this time at last you have consequences how does it feel
37579,dont answer back thats what she wants
37580,it only carries one i had to fly without coordinates i ended up on a skip in the isle of dogs it wasnt funny
37581,do i get a last request
37582,i grew quite fond of my little human life all those rituals the brushing of the teeth and the complicated way they cook things theres a little restaurant just round the bay it became quite a favourite of mine
37583,except i can never escape the doctor so wheres the danger i wonder if you could do it to sit with a creature youre about to kill and take supper how strong is your stomach
37584,i wonder ive seen you fight your enemies now dine with them
37585,prove it
37586,you both wear one if she moves more than ten feet away she gets zapped by ten thousand volts

37590,thank you
37591,tell me then doctor what do you know of our species
37592,did you know for example in extreme cases when her life is in danger a female raxacoricofallapatorian can manufacture a poison dart within her own finger
37593,as a final resort the excess poison can be exhaled through the lungs
37594,public executions a slow death they prepare a thin acetic acid lower me into the cauldron and boil me the acidity is perfectly gauged to strip away the skin internal organs fall out into the liquid and i become soup and still alive still screaming
37595,but you deliver it will you stay to watch
37596,the slitheen familys huge theres a lot more of us all scattered offworld take me to them take me somewhere safe

37599,i promise you ive changed since we last met doctor there was this girl just today a young thing something of a danger she was getting too close i felt the blood lust rising just as the family taught me i was going to kill her without a thought and then i stopped shes alive somewhere right now shes walking around this city because i can change i did change i know i cant prove it
37600,then you know im capable of better
37601,i spared her life
37602,in the family slitheen we had no choice i was made to carry out my first kill at thirteen if id refused my father would have fed me to the venom grubs if im a killer its because i was born to kill its all i know doctor are you even listening to me

37810,thats very kind theres no need
37811,theres not much to do just maintain his smoke and i suppose im company i can hear him singing sometimes in my mind such ancient songs
37812,the rest of boekind became extinct long ago hes the only one left legend says that the face of boe has watched the universe grow old theres all sorts of superstitions around him one story says that just before his death the face of boe will impart his great secret that he will speak those words only to one like himself
37813,its just a story

37837,mankind needed us they came to this planet with so many illnesses we couldnt cope we did try we tried everything we tried using clonemeat and biocattle but the results were too slow so the sisterhood grew its own flesh thats all they are flesh
37838,but think of those humans out there healthy and happy because of us

37901,a tree on the line
37902,i am the queen of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland everything around me tends to be planned
37903,its funny though because you say assassination and you just think of kennedy and stuff not her
37904,i know
37905,she was just sitting there
37906,i want her to say we are not amused i bet you five quid i can make her say it
37907,ten quid
37908,sorry
37909,yes sir
37910,all my fathers work built by hand in his final years became something of an obsession he spent his money on this rather than caring for the house or himself
37911,help yourself
37912,i know nothing about it to be honest most of us thought him a little shall we say eccentric i wish now id spent more time with him and listened to his stories
37913,yep
37914,this device surveys the infinite work of god what could be finer sir roberts father was an example to us all a polymath steeped in astronomy and sciences yet equally well versed in folklore and fairytales
37915,oh my late husband enjoyed his company prince albert himself was acquainted with many rural superstitions coming as he did from saxe coburg
37916,when albert was told about your local wolf he was transported
37917,its just a story
37918,your companion begs an apology doctor her clothing has somewhat delayed her
37919,yes maam sorry maam
37920,indeed since my husbands death i find myself with more of a taste for supernatural fiction
37921,oh yes doctor drawings and woodcarvings and its not merely a wolf its more than that this is a man who becomes an animal
37922,thats what i thought but now i wonder what if they had a different reason for wanting the story kept quiet what if they turned from god and worshipped the wolf
37923,im sorry your majesty theyve got my wife
37924,where the hell have you been
37925,come on go get out
37926,all of you at my side come on

37930,captain reynolds disposed of him
37931,a noble sentiment my sir walter raleigh

37945,gather it up quickly every last scrap quick now
37946,i dont know i suppose
37947,and the wolfs allergic to it
37948,nevertheless that creature wont give up doctor and we still dont possess an actual weapon
37949,being rude again
37950,biology zoology there might be something on wolves in here
37951,some form of explosive
37952,wolfs bane what about that
37953,but thats over three hundred years ago whats it been waiting for
37954,thats what it wants it said so the the empire of the wolf
37955,i would destroy myself rather than let that creature infect me but thats no matter i ask only that you find some place of safekeeping for something far older and more precious than myself
37956,is that the kohinoor
37957,given to me as the spoils of war perhaps its legend is now coming true it is said that whoever owns it must surely die
37958,how much is that worth
37959,good job my mums not here shed be fighting the wolf off with her bare hands for that thing
37960,where is the wolf i dont trust this silence

38712,well of course we have and i have to say if it wasnt for you none of us would be here the doctor and the tardis
38713,oh plenty of time for that but according to the records youre not one for travelling alone the doctor and his companion thats a pattern isnt it right theres no point hiding anything not from us so where is she
38714,im forty
38715,it was only a matter of time until you found us and at last youve made it id like to welcome you doctor welcome to torchwood
38716,came down to earth off the shetland islands ten years ago
38717,do you recognise this doctor
38718,good isnt it took us eight years to get it to work
38719,thank you sebastian i think its very important to know everyone by name torchwood is a very modern organisation people skills thats what its all about these days im a people person
38720,no i dont think so is that important
38721,all these devices are for torchwoods benefit not the general publics
38722,ah yes the ghosts theyre er what you might call a side effect
38723,if its alien its ours
38724,what  adeola
38725,but of course not youre the enemy youre actually named in the torchwood foundation charter of 1879 as an enemy of the crown
38726,her majesty created the torchwood institute with the express intention of keeping britain great and fighting the alien horde
38727,you must be the doctor rajesh singh its an honour sir
38728,well doctor
38729,and what is that
38730,and whats the void
38731,but someone built the sphere what for why go there
38732,you see we were right there is something inside it
38733,so how do we get in there
38734,well thats how it all started the sphere came through into this world and the ghosts followed in its wake
38735,the sphere came through here a hole in the world not active at the moment but when we fire particle engines at that exact spot the breech opens up
38736,we were getting warning signs for years a radar black spot so we built this place torchwood tower the breech was six hundred foot above sea level it was on the only way to reach it
38737,well that is the public name for it but to those in the know its torchwood
38738,i dont think so
38739,oh exactly as the legends would have it the doctor lording it over us assuming alien authority over the rights of man
38740,well in that case well have to be more careful positions ghost shift in one minute
38741,we have done this a thousand times
38742,were in control of the ghosts the levers can open the breach but equally they can close it
38743,sorry
38744,what is that it
38745,ghost shift in twenty seconds
38746,stop the shift i said stop
38747,i suppose it makes sense to get as much intelligence as possible but the programme will recommence as soon as youve explained everything
38748,so these ghosts whatever they are did they build the sphere
38749,she one of yours
38750,good then we can have her shot
38751,he kidnapped me
38752,charming

39019,our builder he sketched the plans to the globe
39020,it was the shape peter streete thought best thats all said it carried the sound well
39021,theres fourteen lines in a sonnet
39022,this is just a theatre
39023,its like your police box small wooden box with all that power inside

39032,hes the same as he was youll get nothing out of him
39033,now he visits the madhouse the architect
39034,witches spoke to peter in the night they whispered they whispered got peter to build the globe to their design their design the fourteen walls always fourteen when the work was done they snapped poor peters wits

39054,the power of a name works only once observe i gaze upon this bag of bones and now i name thee martha jones
39055,only sleeping alas its curious the name has less impact shes somehow out of her time and as for you sir doctor fascinating there is no name why would a man hide his title in such despair oh but look theres still one word with the power that aches
39056,but your heart grows cold the north wind blows and carries down the distant rose
39057,the eternals found the right word to banish us into deep darkness
39058,new words new and glittering from a mind like no other
39059,his son perished the grief of a genius grief without measure madness enough to allow us entrance
39060,just the three but the play tonight shall restore the rest then the human race will be purged as pestilence and from this world we will lead the universe back into the old ways of blood and magic

39153,well id love to but its an automated system the wheel would lock
39154,you cant jump its a thousand feet down
39155,i try not to think about it
39156,the doctor where is he
39157,what are those shapes
39158,what the hell are they

39162,i only brought this in case of pirates doctor youve got to come with me
39163,you havent aged at all time has been less kind to me
39164,ive sought forgiveness doctor for so many years under his guidance and if you come with me i might finally be able to redeem myself
39165,youve got to come with me right now
39166,transport
39167,i only had the power for one trip
39168,high above in the overcity
39169,they died doctor the city died
39170,twenty four years
39171,a new chemical a new mood they called it bliss everyone tried it they couldnt stop a virus mutated inside the compound and became airborne everything perished even the virus in the end it killed the world in seven minutes flat there was just enough time to close down the walkways and the flyovers sealing off the undercity those people on the motorway arent lost doctor they were saved
39172,theres not enough power to get them out we did all we could to stop the system from choking
39173,he protected me and he has waited for you these long years  boe
39174,back in the old days i was made his nurse as penance for my sin
39175,he protected me from the virus by shrouding me in his smoke but with no one to maintain it the citys power died the undercity would have fallen into the sea
39176,the face of boe wired himself into the mainframe hes giving his life force just to keep things running
39177,the last act of the senate was to declare new earth unsafe the automatic quarantine lasts for one hundred years
39178,we had no choice
39179,and you
39180,there isnt enough power
39181,so what are you going to do
39182,doctor

39184,did i tell you doctor youre not bad sir youre not bad at all oh yeehah
39185,doctor
39186,whats that
39187,my lord gave his life to save the city and now hes dying
39188,who is he
39189,the legend says more
39190,it says that the face of boe will speak his final secret to a traveller
39191,i have seen so much perhaps too much i am the last of my kind as you are the last of yours doctor
39192,happy
39193,but what did he mean the face of boe youre not alone

39207,what they actually live in the park in the middle of the city
39208,no stealing and no fighting you know the rules thirteen years ago i fought in the great war a lot of us did and the only reason we got through was because we stuck together no matter how bad things get we still act like human beings its all we got
39209,its true all right
39210,someone takes them at night we hear something someone calls out for help by the time we get there theyre gone like they vanished into thin air

39276,wait
39277,the cult of skaro escaped your slaughter
39278,emergency temporal shift
39279,i am dalek in human form
39280,i feel humanity
39281,i feel everything we wanted from mankind which is ambition hatred aggression and war such a genius for war
39282,i think it does at heart this species is so very dalek
39283,then find him find him  dalek 1
39284,whats happened to laszlo
39285,these daleks they sound like the stuff of nightmares and they want to breed
39286,hoovervilles the lowest place a man can fall theres nowhere else to go
39287,you aint seen them boss
39288,theyre here ive seen them monsters theyre monsters
39289,we need to get out of the park
39290,if we can just hold them off till daylight
39291,oh yeah well see about that
39292,commence the attack       dalek 3
39293,observe humanity for all their faults they have such courage
39294,they killed him they just shot him on the spot
39295,no you cant go
39296,but what about us
39297,then im coming with you
39298,it gets you into places buildings and things but where he must want me to go somewhere but what am i supposed to do
39299,the deaths were wrong
39300,that man their leader solomon he showed courage
39301,thats excellent
39302,you are the last of your kind and now i am the first of mine
39303,we tried everything to survive when we found ourselves stranded in this ignorant age first we tried growing new dalek embryos but their flesh was too weak
39304,this is the true extent of the final experiment
39305,near death with his mind wiped ready to be filled with new ideas
39306,the human dalek race
39307,we have caverns beyond this storing more than a thousand
39308,everything they were has been lost
39309,mainly building that
39310,we needed an energy conductor
39311,i am the genetic template my altered dna was to be administered to each human body a strong enough blast of gamma radiation can splice the dalek and human genetic codes and waken each body from its sleep
39312,soon the greatest solar flare for a thousand years will hit the earth gamma radiation will be drawn to the energy conductor and when it strikes
39313,your genius consider a pure dalek intelligent but emotionless
39314,he was wrong
39315,it makes us lesser than our enemies we must return to the flesh and also the heart
39316,then our purpose is wrong where has our quest for supremacy led us to this hiding in the sewers on a primitive world just four of us left if we do not change now then we deserve extinction
39317,your knowledge of genetic engineering is even greater than ours the new race must be ready by the time the solar flare erupts
39318,i want to change the gene sequence
39319,humans are the great survivors we need that ability
39320,i am their leader
39321,if you dont help me nothing will change
39322,you have your tardis take us across the stars find us a new home and allow the new daleks to start again
39323,eleven minutes
39324,new york city if aliens had to come to earth oh no wonder they came here
39325,we need more chromatin solution  dalek 1
39326,nothing theyre just simple beasts their lifespan is limited none survive beyond a few weeks power up the line feeds
39327,do you trust him
39328,and then what dont talk crazy theres no future for me and him those dalek things took that away the one good thing i had in my life and they destroyed it
39329,the solar flare is imminent the radiation will reach earth in a matter of minutes
39330,start the line feeds
39331,dalekanium

39337,wheres it going
39338,er eleven fifteen
39339,gammon radiation what the heck is that
39340,and weve got to go even higher thats the mast up there look theres three pieces of dalekanium on the base weve got to get them off
39341,i wont just stand here and watch you
39342,youre getting careless
39343,hiya
39344,you are unfit  dalek 1

39350,but its freezing in here doctor whats happening to him
39351,what are you doing
39352,and im telling you im not going
39353,humans with dalek dna
39354,but what of the dalek masters where are they         dalek 3
39355,no i beg you dont  dalek 3
39356,but you are not our master and we we are not daleks
39357,extermin
39358,what happened what was that
39359,only two of the daleks have been destroyed one of the dalek masters must still be alive
39360,you will be exterminated
39361,dalek caan
39362,no youre not not now after all this doctor cant you do something
39363,well i talked to them and i told them what solomon wouldve said and i reckon i shamed one or two of them

39365,the pig and the showgirl
39366,it just proves it i suppose theres someone for everyone
39367,meant to say im sorry

39384,have you what have you heard then
39385,busy doing what exactly
39386,ladies and gentlemen i am professor richard lazarus and tonight i am going to perform a miracle it is i believe the most important advance since rutherford split the atom the biggest leap since armstrong stood on the moon tonight you will watch and wonder tomorrow you will wake to a world which will be changed forever
39387,somebody stop him get him away from those controls
39388,it cant be the same guy its impossible it must be a trick
39389,what just happened then
39390,im famished
39391,you speak as if you see this every day mister
39392,thats not possible
39393,you understand the theory then
39394,no experiment is entirely without risk
39395,youre not qualified to comment
39396,not chaos change a chance for humanity to evolve to improve
39397,goodbye doctor in a few years youll look back and laugh at how wrong you were
39398,so what do we do now
39399,lucky ive just collected a dna sample then isnt it
39400,look at yourself woman
39401,what
39402,i cant see anything different
39403,oh my god did that just change but it cant have
39404,its impossible
39405,that means lazarus has changed his own molecular patterns
39406,but theyre still mutating now
39407,change him into what
39408,that woman said they were going upstairs
39409,im sorry ladies and gentlemen youll have to excuse me while i take care of leticia here ive been neglecting her
39410,is that lady thaw
39411,lazarus
39412,so hes changed already
39413,so he might do this again
39414,like a lot of things around here then
39415,ah doctor
39416,perhaps she should choose her friends more carefully
39417,i find that nothings ever exactly like you expect theres always something to surprise you between the idea and the reality between the motion and the act
39418,what dont tell me what to do
39419,youre right doctor one lifetimes been too short for me to do everything id like how much more ill get done in two or three or four
39420,but if its the right person what a gift that would be
39421,whats that
39422,an intrusion it triggers a security lockdown kills most of the power stops the lifts seals the exits
39423,hes inside
39424,theres an exit in the corner but itll be locked now
39425,over here this way everyone downstairs now hurry
39426,leo leo

39548,impact in eleven fifteen heat shield failing at ten percent
39549,i told you its the doctor

41534,modesty forbids me to agree with you sir but yes yes i am
41535,how do you know that
41536,great swathes of my life have been stolen away when i turn my mind to the past theres nothing
41537,since the cybermen masters of that hellish wallscuttler and old enemies of mine now at work in london town you wont believe this mister smith but they are creatures from another world
41538,its said they fell onto london out of the sky in a blaze of light and they found me something was taken and something was lost what was i like in the past
41539,its strange though i talk of cybermen from the stars and you dont blink mister smith
41540,youre a very odd man
41541,oh the funeral the funerals at two oclock its been a pleasure mister smith dont breathe a word of it
41542,its far dangerous rest assured i shall keep this city safe oh and er merry christmas mister smith

41544,how did you get in
41545,yes id be lost without it
41546,well er it makes a noise thats sonic isnt it now since were acting like common burglars i suggest we get out of plain view
41547,it started with a murder
41548,mr jackson lake a teacher of mathematics from sussex he came to london three weeks ago and died a terrible death
41549,its hard to say his body was never found but then it started more secret murders then abductions children stolen away in silence
41550,the latest murder the reverend aubrey fairchild found with burns to his forehead like some advanced form of electrocution
41551,you ask a lot of questions
41552,the reverend was the pillar of the community a member of many parish boards a keen advocate of childrens charities
41553,its funny i seem to be telling you everything as though you engendered some sort of trust you seem familiar mister smith i know your face but how
41554,is that important
41555,it was more for decoration
41556,it could even seem to be organic but unlike any organism of the natural world shush whats that noise
41557,im fine
41558,ive seen one of these before i was holding this device the night i lost my mind the night i regenerated the cybermen they made me change my mind my face my whole self and you were there who are you

41727,well it didnt do mister watt any harm furthermore one hundred malcolms equals a bernard  doctor

41729,the doctor called me a genius  magambo i know i heard       doctor
41730,theres something in those clouds something shining look
41731,they devour
41732,doctor
41733,you speak the language

43293,well look around art it seems to me theres so much more to the world than the average eye is allowed to see i believe if you look hard there are more wonders in this universe than you could ever have dreamed of
43294,its colour colour that holds the key i can hear the colours listen to them every time i step outside i feel nature is shouting at me come on come and get me come on come on capture my mystery

43308,no its not that i dont like them i find them complex always somewhere between living and dying halfhuman as they turn to the sun a little disgusting but you know they are a challenge
43309,thats him and the eyes without mercy

43311,what about the monster
43312,okay ill get my things
43313,riskier than normal
43314,its so clear you cannot help and when you leave and everyone always leaves i will be left once more with an empty heart and no hope

43316,get out you get out what are you doing here what are you doing here
43317,dont say that please

43343,over here mate
43344,its moving round the room feeling its way around
43345,i cant see a thing
43346,which unfortunately also explains why it is now turning around and heading straight for us
43347,he wasnt without mercy at all he was without sight i didnt mean that to happen i only meant to wound it i never meant to
43348,what is it
43349,he was frightened and he lashed out like humans who lash out when theyre frightened like the villagers who scream at me like the children who throw stones at me
43350,hold my hand doctor try to see what i see we are so lucky we are still alive to see this beautiful world look at the sky its not dark and black and without character the black is in fact deep blue and over there lighter blue and blowing through the blueness and the blackness the wind swirling through the air and then shining burning bursting through the stars can you see how they roar their light everywhere we look the complex magic of nature blazes before our eyes
43351,i only wish i had something of real value to give you
43352,i was thinking i may need some food or something before we leave
43353,yes
43354,and this one
43355,and this
43356,mmm nice come on back to the cafe and you can tell me about all the wonders of the universe
43357,oh thats wonderful
43358,its all about your cries and kisses and those first steps that i cant calculate
43359,oh yes glad to be of help you were nice about my tie
43360,well big question but to me van gogh is the finest painter of them all certainly the most popular great painter of all time the most beloved his command of colour the most magnificent he transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty pain is easy to portray but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world no one had ever done it before perhaps no one ever will again to my mind that strange wild man who roamed the fields of provence was not only the worlds greatest artist but also one of the greatest men who ever lived
43361,this changes everything ill step out tomorrow with my easel on my back a different man i still cant believe that one of the haystacks was in the museum how embarrassing
43362,youve turned out to be the first doctor ever actually to make a difference to my life
43363,time can be rewritten i know it can come on oh the long life of vincent van gogh therell be hundreds of new paintings
43364,so you were right no new paintings we didnt make a difference at all

44396,be aware i do have a sword
44397,and when i saw that face looking through the hatch that woman looking at me
44398,thats probably enough hugging now so her flesh avatar was with us all that time but that means they were projecting a control signal right into the tardis wherever we were in time and space
44399,but why do they want her
44400,is there anything youre not telling us you knew amy wasnt real you never said
44401,but you always hold out on us please not this time doctor its our baby tell us something one little thing

44405,the words of an old friend who once found me in the london underground attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly innocent tunnel diggers
44406,as you were today old friend point taken i hope now i have a question a simple one is melody human
44407,theyve been scanning her since she was born and i think they found what they were looking for
44408,its starting please listen to me
44409,youve told me about your people they became what they did through prolonged exposure to the time vortex the untempered schism
44410,so how close is she could she even regenerate
44411,you dont sound so sure
44412,which leads me to ask when did it happen
44413,i am trying to be delicate i know how you can blush when did this baby begin
44414,quite
44415,but could the child have begun on the tardis in flight in the vortex
44416,on their what
44417,the headless monks arent alive they dont register as life forms
44418,and yet they gave in so easily does this not that bother anyone else
44419,or the instincts of a coward this is too easy theres something wrong
44420,a weapon
44421,well theyve seen you
44422,mister maldovar youre right this was too easy we should get back to the others
44423,the child at all costs protect the child     kovarian

44433,well then soldier how goes the day
44434,i couldnt have prevented this
44435,and so my love could you i know youre not all right but hold tight amy because youre going to be
44436,this was exactly you all this all of it you make them so afraid when you began all those years ago sailing off to see the universe did you ever think youd become this the man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name doctor the word for healer and wise man throughout the universe we get that word from you you know but if you carry on the way you are what might that word come to mean to the people of the gamma forests the word doctor means mighty warrior how far youve come and now theyve taken a child the child of your best friends and theyre going to turn her into a weapon just to bring you down and all this my love in fear of you

45281,the pain in my legs is gone i can move them thank you doctor
45282,we ejected them the robots woke them from cryosleep a handful at a time and jettisoned them from the airlocks we must have left a trail of dust and bone
45283,their ship crossed my path i sent out a distress signal they let me board and when i saw the cargo things became more complex
45284,very emotive words doctor
45285,the lizards wouldnt negotiate i made them a generous offer

45303,you think i wont punish those who get in my way whatever theyre worth

45408,after the global appearance of millions of small cubes despite official warnings people have been taking the cubes from the streets into offices and homes  matthew
45409,what if theyre bombs billions of tiny bombs or transport capsules maybe with a mini robot inside or deadly hard drives or alien eggs or messages needing decoding or theyre all parts of a bigger whole jigsaw puzzles that need fitting together
45410,there couldnt be lifeforms in every cube could there

45416,since me units been adapting well i dragged them along kicking and screaming which made it sound like more fun than it actually was
45417,far less than we need to weve been freighting them in from around the world for testing so far weve subjected them to temperatures of plus and minus two hundred celsius simulated a water depth of five miles dropped one out of a helicopter at ten thousand feet and rolled our best tank over it always intact
45418,we dont know how they got here what theyre made of or why theyre here
45419,like ipads have dropped out of the sky taking them to work taking pictures making films posting them on flickr and youtube within three hours the cubes had a thousand separate twitter accounts
45420,ive recommended we treat this as a hostile incursion gather them all up and lock them in a secure facility but that would take massive international agreement and cooperation
45421,maybe they wanted to be seen noticed
45422,you were the one who wanted to observe them
45423,you said we had to be patient
45424,fine be busy well watch the cubes
45425,er about an hour

46424,doctor help us
46425,as the battle raged between humanity and the cyberiad the cyberplanners built a valkyrie to save critically damaged units and bring them here and one by one repair them
46426,weve upgraded ourselves the next model will be undefeatable
46427,we needed children to build a new cyberplanner a childs brain with its infinite potential is perfect for our needs but we no longer need the children the cybermites have been scanning your brain doctor its quite remarkable
46428,incorporated yes ah unfamiliar pulmonary setup nervous system hyperconductive remarkable brain processing speed ho ho amazing
46429,just you try and stop me ooo whos clara why are you thinking about her so much
46430,relax relax if you just relax you will find this a perfectly pleasant experience you are being upgraded and incorporated into the cyberiad as a cyberplanner
46431,oh this is brilliant im so clever already and now im a million times more clever and what a brain not a human brain not even slightly human i mean im going to have to completely rework the neural interface but this is going to be the most efficient cyberplanner not a great name that is it i could call myself mister clever so much raw data time lords theres information on the time lords in here oh this is just dreamy
46432,fantastic
46433,we each control forty nine point eight eight one percent of this brain point two three eight of the brain is still in the balance whoever gets this gets the whole thing

46435,you understand when i do win the cyberiad gets your brains and memories all of it
46436,there that was easy the game has just started doctor why is there no record of you anywhere in the databanks of the cyberiad oh youre good oh youve been eliminating yourself from history you know you could be reconstructed by the hole youve left
46437,the rules of chess allow only a finite number of moves and i can use other cyberunits as remote processors you cannot possibly win
46438,really thats your secret weapon cleaning fluid
46439,you dont think that was the only one then
46440,did you get the kids are they all right whats going on
